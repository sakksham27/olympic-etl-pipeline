159249,"Coxless Fours, Men",1992 Summer Olympics,23,Rowing,/editions/23/sports/ROW,28 July –  2 August 1992,"Lago de Bañolas, Bañolas",56 from 14 countries,na,na,"Australia had won the men’s coxless fours at the last two editions of the World Championships and was represented at the 1992 Summer Olympics by its most recent squad: Andrew Cooper, [Mike McKay(/athletes/35479), Nick Green, and James Tomkins. They were the favorites in the event and seemed unlikely to be challenged by any other crew. In the opening round they won their heat in the fastest time, but the Americans were not far behind in their own. The United States lineup contained three runners-up from the most recent World Championships, Thomas Bohrer, Pat Manning, Jr.,and Jeff McLaughlin, and was augmented by Doug Burden, a bronze medalist from the coxed eights event from the 1988 Games. McLaughlin was also a bronze medalist from that event, while Bohrer had earned silver in that year’s coxless fours tournament. The third heat was won by Spain, whose crew included one of Spain’s two Olympic rowing medalists, Fernando Climent. Australia and the United States were the heat winners again in the semi-finals, and again were separated by only a small margin of time, while Spain was eliminated. In the final, however, Australia mustered up its strength reserves and won handily, leaving the silver medal to the Americans. Slovenia, meanwhile, whose squad included 1988 coxless pairs bronze medalist Sadik Mujkič, took bronze by edging out the Germans in a photo finish by a margin of 0.15 seconds. This gave Slovenia one of its first Olympic rowing medals as an independent nation, the other being bronze in the men’s coxless pairs.

The event generated some controversy before it started when the athletes complained about the risks and dangers of the course, notably two-time halfpipe gold medalist Shaun White. He withdrew, citing his emphasis on the halfpipe, but also noting the danger of the course. This led to a war of tweets between White and Canadian favorite Max Parrot, the 2014 X-Games champion in slopestyle. Some changes were made to the course, which satisfied the athletes and no major injuries occurred.
The event was the first to crown a champion at Sochi and was won by American Sage Kotsenburg, in somewhat of an upset. Kotsenburg had won silver medals in the event at the X-Games in 2010 and 2012, but was not considered among the medal favorites. Kotsenburg did not make the finals from the qualifying round, and had to go thru the semi-finals to qualify. His gold medal, the first at Sochi, marked the first time an American had won the first Winter Olympic gold medal since Alpine skiier Andrea Mead-Lawrence in 1952.
The silver went to Norwegian Ståle Sandbech, who had won the bronze medal at the 2014 X-Games, only a few weeks before Sochi. Bronze medalist Canadian Mark McMorris had been among the medal favorites, having won silver medals in slopestyle at the 2014 X-Games and the 2013 World Championships, but his Olympic medal showed some toughness, as he broken two ribs at the X-Games only weeks before. Favored Max Parrot made the final but placed only fifth.

But they came very close. The gold medal was won by Italy’s Galliano Rossini, who was unchallenged with 195 birds, winning by five. Rossini was a distant descendent of the composer, Giacomo Puccini. Third-place was originally a tie between three shooters – Italy’s Alessandro Ciceri, and Nikolay Mogilevsky and Yury Nikandrov of the Soviet Union. But Ciceri shut-out the Soviets from the medals, winning the shoot-off with 24, to 23 for Mogilevsky and 22 for Nikandrov.

He competed at München but placed only eighth. The gold medal was an easy victory for Sweden’s Ragnar Skanåker, whose score of 567 was five points ahead of Romania’s Dan Iuga in second place. This was the first shooting event of the 1972 Olympics and brought Sweden its first shooting gold medal in 36 years. This was Skanåker’s first Olympics, but far from his last. He would compete continuously thru 1996, appearing in seven Olympic Games.

She had also won the 2010 Europeans but had been popped for PEDs (a stimulant) and served a six-month doping suspension in 2011. The 2011 World Champion was China’s Li Yanfeng, who was expected to contend, along with German Nadine Müller, silver medalist at Daegu in 2011, and Russian Darya Pishchalnikova, the 2006 European Champion, also returning from a two-year drug suspension when she and six other Russian athletes were found to have manipulated their drug testing samples in 2010. Perković had won 9 of 10 meets in 2012, but Pishchalnikova came into form late, with marks of 70.69, the world’s longest throw in 20 years, and 69.34 in her last two meets. Defending champion Stephanie Brown-Trafton of the United States was back in the final, but was a medal longshot.
Müller led the first round of the final with a toss of 65.71, Pishchalnikova in second and Perković in third. In the second round Li took the lead with 67.22, but four throws later, Perković got the platter out to 68.11, a mark that would be good enough for gold. But she would improve it, tossing 69.11 in round three, the eventual winning mark. Li was second through four rounds with Pishchalnikova moving up to third place in that round. But in round five she improved to 67.56 which would win her the silver medal, Li taking bronze. Müller improved her opener in round six with 65.94 but it was only good enough for fifth place. Brown-Trafton was never a factor and placed eighth. Perković’s gold medal was the first athletics gold medal for Croatia as an independent nation.
In February 2013 it was revealed that the original silver medalist in this event, Russian Darya Pishchalnikova, had tested positive before the London Olympics, in May 2012, for oxandrolone. She was disqualified and lost her silver medal, which went to China’s Li Yanfeng, with the bronze medal re-assigned to Cuban Yarelis Barrios.
Barrios had initially won a silver medal in this event at Beijing in 2008, but during IOC re-testing of the samples from the 2008 and 2012 Olympics, in September 2016, she was revealed to have a positive re-test for acetazolamide, and was disqualified, losing her silver medal.

359542,"Football, Women",2016 Summer Olympics,59,Football,/editions/59/sports/FBL,3 – 19 August 2016,"Estádio do Maracanã, Maracanã, Rio de Janeiro / Estádio Olímpico João Havelange, Engenho de Dentro, Rio de Janeiro / Estádio Nacional de Brasília Mané Garrincha, Brasília / Minerão, Belo Horizonte / Arena Fonte Nova, Salvador / Arena Corinthians, São Paulo / Arena da Amazônia, Manaus",203 from 12 countries,Round-robin pools advance teams to single-elimination tournament of four teams.,na,"As the reigning Olympic champions, World Cup holders and ranked number one by FIFA, the United States went into the 2016 tournament as very clear favourites. They had an outstanding Olympic record, winning four of the five finals up to 2016, and finishing second in the other, to Norway after sudden-death extra-time in 2000. Seven members of their squad had already won Olympic gold, including goalkeeper Hope Solo, who was going for a record fourth gold in Rio. USA also had the reigning Word Player of the Year, Carli Lloyd, in their squad.
Being on home soil, Brazil, the 2015 Pan-Am champions, looked likely to provide stiff opposition  to the USA. Their team included the five-times Word Player of the Year Marta, and 38-year-old midfielder Formiga, an ever-present since the first Olympic tournament in 1996, thus playing in her sixth Games. The European challenge was expected to come from France, FIFA ranked three, and the talented Germans, twice World Cup winners and three times Olympic bronze medallist, and the number two ranked team by FIFA.
The tournament got off to a great start with Janine Beckie of Canada scoring the fastest goal in Olympic history, when she netted after just 20 seconds against Australia on the first day of the tournament. It beat by 10 seconds the goal scored by Oribe Peralta of Mexico in the 2012 men’s final against Brazil. Sadly for Beckie, her record stood only two weeks until bettered by six seconds by Brazil’s Neymar in the men’s semi-final against Honduras.
The United States qualified as top of their group despite being held by Colombia in their final group game. It was Colombia women’s first ever point in the Olympics. In the USA’s 1-0 win over France, Hope Solo became the first goalkeeper in the world, male or female, to win 200 caps. Germany also qualified for the knockout stage, but only as the second best team in their group behind Canada. They were held to a surprise 2-2 draw in their second group game by the Australians after coming from two goals down and scoring a late equaliser. Australia had the youngest member of the football tournament (men and women) in their squad - 16 -year-old defender Ellie Carpenter. To make matters worse for the Germans, they lost their final group game 2-1 to Canada.  Brazil qualified from their group as the only South American nation in the last eight, while Germany were joined by fellow Europeans Sweden and France, and China and Australia made up the quarter-finals.
The first last eight match saw one of the biggest upsets in women’s Olympic football history as the United States lost to Sweden in the first ever women’s penalty shoot-out. It was also the United States’ first defeat in the Olympics since a 2-0 loss to Norway in a group match in 2008. The US coach who guided them to gold that year, and again in 2012, was Pia Sundhage, and she was now Sweden’s head coach who masterminded their win over the USA in 2016. After the match, Hope Solo called the Swedes “A bunch of cowards”. These remarks earned her a six month suspension from the US team after the Olympics and the termination of her US Soccer Federation contract after 17 years.
Shortly after Sweden’s win in that first ever penalty-shoot out, along came a second when Brazil beat Australia 7-6 on penalties after finishing goalless after 120 minutes. The semi-finals were made up with world number two Germany beating China 1-0 and world number 10 Canada surprising the third ranked FIFA team, France, by the same scoreline.
All four teams in the semis were searching for their first Olympic title and the Brazilian women were hoping to achieve that goal before their male counterparts, albeit by a day, but it was not to be. Just as they did in their win over the USA, Sweden approached the game against Brazil with a defensive attitude and were happy to keep the game goalless for 120 minutes and take the game to penalties. They were all square in the shoot-out when Andressa’s spot kick was saved and Dahlkvist scored the winning goal for the Europeans. Germany made it an all-European final after beating 2012 bronze medalists Canada 2-0 with goals from Melane Behringer and Sara Däbritz.
Having lost out on the chance to become Brazil’s first Olympic soccer champions, the ladies team was hoping at least for a bronze medal but it was Canada who opened the scoring in the bronze medal match in the 25th minute through Deanne Rose who, at 17, was the youngest member of the Canadian squad. They increased their lead on 52 minutes through Christine Sinclair and they seemed to have secured the bronze medal, but when Beatriz scored for the hosts 11 minutes from time it set up a tense finale. Canada held on for back-to-back bronze medals as they became the first Canadians to win consecutive medals in a Summer Olympics team sport since they won lacrosse gold in both 1904 and 1908.
Both Sweden, ranked six, and Germany, ranked two, were in the women’s final for the first time and, for Sweden, it was at the sixth time of asking, having appeared in every edition since women’s football first appeared at Atlanta in 1996. They had never won a medal previously and Germany’s best finish was third on three occasions. The final was a repeat of the 2004 bronze medal match, which Germany won 1-0.
After a goalless first half at the Maracanã, Dzsenifer Marozsan put Germany ahead three minutes into the second half, with a curling finish. Their lead was extended on 62 minutes when Linda Sembrant put through her own goal after Marozsan’s free-kick hit the post. Five minutes later Sweden pulled a goal back when a cross from Kosse Asslani was turned into the goal by Stina Blackstenius, but one goal was not enough and Germany won 2-1. It was their first ever women’s Olympic football gold medal, and the first for the German nation since the GDR men took gold at Montreal in 1976.

Because of the pending trial, his firearms license was suspended and he could not train for several months. The charges were eventually dropped and he was added to the team at the last minute. But he would not make the final in Athina, firing only 119 in the prelims. The qualifying leader was Russian Aleksey Alipov with 124. He went clear in the final with 25 to win the gold medal.

We have listed them among the official contestants to indicate approximately where they would have placed, but they had no official placings.  All eight had also competed in the Gentlemen’s Double York Round.

But a top runner on the international circuit in 2004 was Grenada’s Alleyne Francique. In the final, the Americans were in lanes 3-5, with Wariner in the middle. Harris led out for 200 metres, but the Americans were 1-2-3. At 300 metres Wariner and Harris were in a virtual dead-heat. But Wariner maintained more speed down the stretch and just over a metre, Harris in second, and Brew completing the American sweep. Françique placed fourth, never a factor for a medal after the first 200.

The course had been used for the 1974 World Championships and the favorite was probably Ryszard Szurkowski of Poland, who was 1973 World Champion and had placed second on the course in 1974. The 1974 champion was his teammate, Janusz Kowalski, but he did not compete in Montréal. On the sixth lap, a group of 10 riders got away, and formed the winning group. On the last lap, Bernt Johansson was able to successfully break away and won the gold medal by 31 seconds. The winner of the sprint for the silver was Peter Thaler, but he was relegated to ninth place for interfering with other riders in the sprint and failing to keep his line. The final sprint included an American, George Mount, unusual for that era, who finished sixth. Szurkowski had missed the winning break and finished 12th, among the leaders of the trailing sprint. Of the three medalists, only Johansson would have a notable pro career. His best performance came in the 1979 Giro d’Italia, in which he placed third and won two stages.

Jackie was Jackie Silva, who competed for Brazil in indoor volleyball in 1980 and 1984, but moved to the beach in 1988. She and Sandra Pires had hooked up as a team in 1993 and quickly became the dominant team in the world.

David Wallechinsky, in The Complete Book of the Winter Olympics, also noted that Håkonsen’s personal boycott went deeper, when he said, “Snowboarding is about fresh tracks and carving powder and being yourself, and not being judged by others. It’s not about nationalism and politics and big money. Snowboarding is everything the Olympics isn’t.” In his absence, the event was wide open. Thirty-six boarders advanced 16 to the final round. In the first round of the final, Switzerland’s Gian Simmen took the lead over Canada’s Brett Carpentier. Simmen’s second round was solid, though only the fourth best of the round, but he was able to hold on for the gold medal, which was a major surprise, as he was only 38th in the world rankings. Daniel Franck (NOR) was only in seventh place after round one, but had the highest score of the competition on his second run to move up to the silver medal.

A distance specialist, Maier had set the last four world records in the 10K, including two in January 1968, and had already won the 5,000 in Grenoble. He seemed on form for a sure gold medal. He started in the first pair and his time of 15:23.9 was 26+ seconds under the Olympic record, only 3.6 seconds above his world record, and was the second fastest time ever. The gold seemed to be his. A challenger was thought to be Kees Verkerk (NED), but when he finished in 15:33.9 in the third pair, Maier seemed home free. But then Sweden’s Johnny Höglin started in the seventh pair. Though he had competed internationally since 1965, he had no significant reputation at any distance, and had never sniffed a podium before. But he hung on to Maier’s pace, almost equal to it through 8,400 metres. And he hung on, gradually pulling ahead in the next three laps, and finishing in 15:23.6 for one of the most improbable speed skating gold medals ever.
A few weeks later Maier would win the World Championships, and the 5 and 10K at that tournament. In 1968 he set seven world records, won both the European and World Championships and the 5 and 10K at both tournaments, won the 5,000 Olympic gold medal, but missed the one he wanted most. For Höglin, this was his career. He would mount the podium only one other time in a major international, at 1,500 metres at the 1974 European Championships. The bronze medalist, another Swede, was even more surprising. Örjan Sandler had competed around the world since 1964. But until the 1968 Winter Olympics, he had never finished better than 10th at any distance in any major meet.

He came into London as the favorite, but was expected to be challenged mainly by his countrymen, Abel Kirui and Emmanuel Mutai. A surprising omission from their Olympic team was world record holder Patrick Makau. The opening pace was pedestrian, going through 10K in a 2-09:49 pace, but Kipsang then put the hammer down, running the next two miles in 4:30 and 4:36, to spread out the field, dropping Mutai. At the halfway point he had a 16-second lead on a group of six contenders. Among these were Kirui and the surprising Ugandan Stephen Kiprotich, more known as a track and cross-country runner. He had been sixth at the 2011 International Cross-Country race, and then made his marathon début at the Enschede race, winning in his first marathon.
At 22 km, Kiprotich gave chase on Kipsang, pulling Kirui along with him, and basically settling the medal race. The two caught Kipsang at 24 km and they would remain together through 35 km. Kiprotich then dropped back slightly, seemingly injured as he slapped at a cramping left hammie. But it was possibly more a tactical pause as he surged ahead going up Fish Street Hill, and dropped both Kenyans over the next minute. He poured on a 4:42 24th mile that left him alone and Kiprotich came home to win Uganda’s first ever medal in the marathon, and their first Olympic gold medal in athletics since John Akii-Bua had won the 1972 400 hurdles.
Kirui attempted to run with Kiprotich but was unable to, while behind him, Kipsang gave way after setting the early pace, and he would win bronze. American Meb Keflezighi, silver medalist at the 2004 Athens Olympics, came home just out of the medals in fourth.

Surpassed in round two by Pigi Devetzi of Greece (15.23 [49-11¾]), she answered later in the round with 15.39 (50-6), which would prove to be the winning mark. In the third round, Russian Tatyana Lebedeva jumped 15.32 (50-3¼) and that held up for the silver medal. Lebedeva would return five days later to add a silver in the long jump.

In 2015, however, the IOC began re-testing samples from the 2008 Beijing and 2012 London Olympics, using newer, more advanced testing techniques, in an effort to find those who had used performance enhancing drugs (PEDs), but in whom it could not be detected at the time of those Olympics. This was one of the many events affected.
In January 2017 Tatyana Lebedeva (RUS) had a positive re-test for turinabol (dehydrochloromethyltestosterone) and was tentatively disqualified. Lebedeva lawyered up, however, and appealed the disqualification to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS), but the CAS rejected that appeal in July 2018. Bronze medalist Pigi Devetzi also had a positive re-test, announced in November 2016, and was also disqualified. Lebedeva also lost the silver medal from the long jump event, while Devetzi was also DQed from that event, in which she finished 14th. At the time her doping was revealed Lebedeva was a member of the Russian state Duma, the IAAF Women’s Committee, and the World Olympians Association Executive Committee. Lebedeva appealed the disqualification but it was finally denied in 2018 and the medals re-assigned, with Olga Rypakova (KAZ) receiving the silver, and Yargelis Savigne (CUB) the bronze.

The top finishers of the 2007 Worlds qualified for the event, and they were seeded accordingly. Because of this, it was not a major surprise that the final results were essentially the same. World Champion Qin Lizi of the host nation defeated Mary Jane Estimar of the Philippines for the title, as Nguyễn (Vietnam) and Dehghani collected bronze as losing semi-finalists. Estimar barely made it to the final, suffering from an ankle sprain in her semi-final bout against Dehghani, but she recoved in time to fight in the final. Dehghani, meanwhile, made Olympic history by becoming the first ever Iranian woman to be on an Olympic podium, albeit for an exhibition event.

She survived a close call in the quarter-finals where she needed a barrage but then proceeded to the final pool, defeating reigning Olympic champion Heidi Schmid on the way.
The final pool stage proved inconclusive with Rejtő-Ujlaky, Helga Mees of Germany and Antonella Ragno of Italy each recording two wins out of three. Ragno lost both matches in the barrage which left the final match as Rejtő-Ujlaky versus Mees to decide the Olympic title. Mees had already defeated the Hungarian on two occasions during the competition but this time the tables were turned and Rejtő-Ujlaky emerged the winner by 4 hits to 2.
Rejtő-Ujlaky added a bronze medal in the individual event in 1968 and won team medals in every Olympic Games until 1976.

Some of the top 5,000 metre runners were considering competing in the 1,500, the steeplechase, and the 10,000, so nobody knew what the final field would look like. Uganda’s Joshua Cheptegei was the world record holder but he was also considering the 10,000, in which he had won the 2019 World Championship. Norway’s Jakob Ingebrigtsen would eventually only run the 1,500. One favorite, Ethiopian Getnet Wale, had finished fourth in the steeplechase and would not get out of the 5K heats. Forecasting the event was futile.
In the final Cheptegei controlled the race throughout, taking the early lead, and then leading for several laps with teammate Jacob Kiplimo. Kiplimo led through 2,300 metres before Cheptegei went to the lead, although he allowed Kenyan Nicholas Kipkorir Kimeli to lead briefly.
Cheptegei went back to the front at 4,000 metres and held the lead to the finish, winning the gold medal. He was pushed by Kimeli on the backstretch of the final lap, but then left him easily. Kimeli was challenged by American Paul Chelimo, but they were passed on the final straight by Canada’s Mohammed Ahmed, who had run for the University of Wisconsin in the USA, and would win the silver medal. Chelimo, the 2016 Rio silver medalist, dove at the line to finish ahead of Kimeli and win his second consecutive medal in the event.
Cheptegei became only the fifth world record holder in the 5K to also win an Olympic gold medal in the event, joining Hannes Kolehmainen (1912), Paavo Nurmi (1924), Lauri Lehtinen (1932), and Kenenisa Bekele (2008).

It was thought she would compete at the 1932 Olympics for the United States, but shortly before she was to become a naturalized citizen, she elected to compete for Poland. In the first round in Los Angeles she equaled the world record of 11.9, and posted that mark again in the semis.

Silver went to Yekaterina Rabaya/Aleksey Alipov and bronze was won by Kirsty Barr/Aaron Heading. While Rabaya did not compete in Tokyo, Alipov did with a different partner. Barr competed in this event under her married name Hegarty and was partnered with Matthew Coward-Holley, with Heading competing only in the individual trap event in Tokyo. The 2019 World Shotgun Championships winners Laetisha Scanlan/James Willett also partnered up in Tokyo, with silver won by Yuliya Saveleva/Maksim Smykov (RUS) and bronze by Smith/Grice at those championships.
The qualification round was over 150 shots in total, with 75 by each shooter, and was topped by Fátima Gálvez/Alberto Fernández and Alessandra Perilli/Gian Marco Berti with 148 as both pairs missed only two targets. They were followed by Štefečeková/Varga and Madelynn Bernau/Brian Burrows, who both scored 146. As there was no second qualification stage like in the other two team events, the first two qualified for the gold medal match and the next two for the bronze medal match. A shoot-off for both was necessary to determine the places 1-2 and 3-4. This was important because in both medal matches the better placed team was allowed to start first.
The bronze medal match went into a shoot-off and Bernau/Burrows secured bronze with the third shot. During the match Štefečeková/Vargahad already led by three targets after 42 shots, but Bernau/Burrows managed to come back in the last eight shots to tie 42-42. In the gold medal match Gálvez/Fernández took the lead after 32 shots and held the first position for the next 18 shots to win gold by a margin of one. With Perilli/Berti winning silver for San Marino they gave the tiny country only their second ever Olympic medal, only two days after Perilli had won their first ever medal with bronze in the women’s trap. The gold medal for Gálvez/Fernández was also historical as it was the first ever shooting gold medal for Spain.

The Swedes were captained by Elisabeth Högström, former World and multiple European champion. Canadian skip Linda Moore’s victory in the tournament did receive attention in the national press for being the only gold medal – albeit in a demonstration sport – that Canada acquired at the Games, but it did little to soften the blow of the country’s failure, for the second time, to achieve gold in an official event at an Olympics hosted on their home soil.

Gray then elected to bypass the bronze medal race against Pellizzari, with US newspapers noting that Gray was saving himself for the kilometer while Dutch newspapers stated that Gray was protesting the decision in his race against Chaillot.

Wind was still a factor, but at the end the top six of the WCSL finished in the top six.
Svindal won gold for Norway, which was the last men’s Olympic Alpine skiing gold missing for that country. He also became the first man to win both speed events at the Olympics after his Super G gold medal from Vancouver in 2010 and he became the oldest Olympic Alpine skiing champion ever, at 35-051.

Much the most impressive performer in the earlier rounds was Australia’s Leisel Jones. Jones had also been a standout at the 2003 World Championships but in that final Luo had successfully gambled everything on a fast start that seemed to unnerve the Australian. Would the Olympic final follow the same path? The answer was yes.

In the end, some athletics’ historians would call this the greatest race ever run.
The favorite was Norwegian Karsten Warholm, the 2017 and 2019 World Champion, who had broken the world record earlier in July 2021, running 46.70 at the Bislett Meet in Oslo, to break the record set back in Seoul by Kevin Young, who won the 1988 Olympic gold medal with 46.78, which was the first sub-47 second time.
Warholm’s main challenger was considered to be American Rai Benjamin, who had just missed Young’s world record in winning the US Olympic Trials, recording 46.83. Benjamin had been the top American for several years now but had never beaten Warholm. There were two other top challengers in Qatari Abderrahman Samba and Brazilian Alison dos Santos, but the race was expected to come down to Warholm vs. Benjamin.
And so it did. Benjamin was in lane five, with Warholm in six, Samba in seven, and dos Santos outside them in lane eight. Warholm always starts fast and led to hurdle three, when Benjamin caught up to him. Over hurdle four Benjamin had to chop his stride to make his 13 steps between hurdles and it slowed him slightly, as Warholm opened a lead, which grew through hurdle seven. Then Benjamin started reeling Warholm back in and as they approached the final hurdle he was on his shoulder. Warholm had to shorten his strides to get to hurdle 10 in 15 steps and his favored lead leg, but he poured it on to the finish to win by a stride over Benjamin.
Rai Benjamin had shattered Karsten Warholm’s recent world record, finishing in 46.17 – and he had lost, as Warholm had finished in a Beamon-like 45.94, going past the 46-second barrier that was not considered possible before the Olympics. Warholm’s first thought, when he stared at the finish board in the stadium, was, “That’s sick.” In third dos Santos ran the fourth fastest time ever with 46.72, bettered before the Olympics only by Warholm’s world record. Finishing fourth was Kyron McMaster from the British Virgin Islands, who still moved to 7th on the all-time performer list. The race produced the fastest times-for-place for 1st through 8th.
When asked if it was the greatest race in history, Warholm said it was “up there.” Benjamin was more emphatic, saying, “That was the best race in Olympic history.” Nobody was arguing with him.

By contrast, the top Russian sled with Aleksandr Zubkov at the helm had a consistent but not spectacular season but their entire efforts for the year were totally concentrated on the Sochi Games.
Zubkov and his crewmate, professional arm wrestling champion Aleksey Voyevoda, used their extensive knowledge of the Olympic track to great advantage. The pairing set a track record on their 1st run to open up a lead that was expanded on in every subsequent run. This was achieved despite strong rumours that the two men had an antagonistic relationship. After bronze medals in 2006 and 2010, Hefti’s Swiss sled moved up to silver in 2014 with Holcomb’s US sled narrowly beating off the challenge of the 2nd Russian sled to claim the bronze medal. This was the first American medal in the event for 62 years.
A major talking point was the lack of performance of the German crews. Germany had placed a crew on the podium on every World Championship events in the years since the Vancouver Olympics but 2013-14 had slowly turned into a disaster for them. Francesco Friedrich had been World Champion 12 months earlier but he lost his fight against the technical inadequacies of his equipment and could only scrape a top ten finish. To add salt to the wound German car giant BMW were in partnership with the US team and designed the team’s sleds.
The return of a Jamaican team to the Olympic arena gained much publicity with 46 year old Winston Watts making a comeback after missing the Torino and Vancouver Games.
In May 2016 WADA (World Anti-Doping Agency) commissioned a report, the McLaren Report, to look into allegations of systematic Russian doping and a cover-up to avoid positives at the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics. The report was released in two parts, in July and December 2016, and confirmed the allegations. In 2017 the IOC formed a commission to investigate this, headed by IOC Member Denis Oswald, and usually referred to as the Oswald Commission. In late October 2017 the Oswald Commission began to release its findings.
All eight members of the Russian bobsleigh teams, which originally finished first and fourth in this event were disqualified in November-December 2017. Appeals were made immediately to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS), but were denied and the Russian teams remained disqualified and the medals were re-allocated.
A special committee of the International Bobsleigh and Skeleton Federation (IBSF) was then charged with investigating these findings, but refused to acknowledge the disqualifications and allowed all the sliders to continue competing. The IOC was not happy with that ruling and the Executive Committee of the IBSF then appealed to the CAS, against its own sub-committee, to have that ruling overturned.

She was joined by Russians Anna Chicherova, also with a first-attempt clearance, and Yelena Slesarenko, and well-known Belgian heptathlete Tia Hellebaut. Vlašić and Chicherova were again perfect over 2.03 (6-8), while Hellebaut needed two attempts to clear, and Slesarenko went out. But at 2.05 (6-8¾) Hellebaut sailed over on her first attempt for a PR, after Vlašić had missed once. She succeeded on her second attempt but neither could clear 2.07 (6-9½) and the gold medal was Hellebaut’s, the first for Belgium in athletics since 1964 (Gaston Roelants in the steeplechase). Hellebaut was a rare athlete who competed while wearing glasses.
That was how the event and the results seemed to have ended. In 2015, however, the IOC began re-testing samples from the 2008 Beijing and 2012 London Olympics, using newer, more advanced testing techniques, in an effort to find those who had used performance enhancing drugs (PEDs), but in whom it could not be detected at the time of those Olympics. This was one of the many events affected.
In October 2016 Anna Chicherova (RUS) was revealed to have a positive re-test for turinabol (dehydrochloromethyltestosterone), and was disqualified, losing her bronze medal. She appealed to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) but that appeal was denied on 6 October 2017.

Despite losing the final of the European Championships to Ramaz Paliani of Russia early in 1996 he still arrived in Atlanta as a strong favourite for gold. As well as Paliani, Asian champion Somluck Kamsing, a convert from Thai-style boxing, and Cuban Lorenzo Aragon were also expected to mount medal challenges.
The joker in the pack came from the host nation in the shape of Floyd Mayweather, Jr., a precociously talented teenager whose father and uncle had been outstanding professionals a decade earlier. Mayweather won his first bouts then dispatched Pan-American champion Aragon on a 12-11 decision in the quarter-finals. This was the first time an American boxer had beaten a Cuban at the Olympics since 1976. This set the scene for a Todorov-Mayweather semi-final which was to become one of the major talking points of the whole tournament.  Todorov was ruled the winner on a 10-9 decision which was roundly booed by the American fans in the arena. The US team filed a protest alleging that head boxing official, a countryman of Todorov’s, intimidated the judges into favouring the Bulgarian but this was dismissed by the AIBA.
Meanwhile Somluck Kamsing had made his way to the final in less controversial fashion.  Thailand had never previously won an Olympic title in 40 years of participation but Kamsing was in no mood to fail and took an early lead against Todorov that he never let go and won by 8-5.
He became a national hero in Thailand and, despite being nominally amateur, received $1,000,000 in gifts from government and business sources. He eventually competed in 4 Olympic Games but this was the only medal he won.
Both losing semi-finalists became world champions as professionals with Mayweather becoming one of the few genuine superstars of the sport as the sport declined from the start of the 21st century. By the start of 2013   he remained unbeaten as a professional through 2013 and  had career earnings of $213 million.

At 30 km. the leaders were Nizhegorodov, 2007 World silver medalist Yohann Diniz (FRA), Alex Schwazer (ITA), and 20 km. bronze medalist Jared Tallent (AUS). Diniz faded and withdrew shortly thereafter, the victim of the high heat (closing temps near 30° C. [80° F.]) and humidity. Nizhegorodov fell back by 35 km., and Schwazer dropped Tallent at 42 km. Schwazer was by far the strongest at the end, winning by over two minutes, with Tallent adding a silver medal to his 20 km. bronze, and Nizhegorodov holding on for bronze.

Kiplimo and Barega were only 20-years-old and had met 10 times at various distances, but never over 10,000 metres.
The day was not overly hot for the Tokyo summer, at 24° C. (75° F.), but it was run in a stifling 98% humidity. The early pace was set by Uganda’s Stephen Kissa who later explained that he was doing that “for the team.” Although not running overly fast, his lead stretched to almost 50 metres as the field refused to go out too quickly because of the weather.
Kissa led to almost 6,000 metres when the pack reeled him in, but the field stayed together as the pace did not pick up until four laps remained. With 800 metres to go there were still 12 runners in the lead pack, and at the bell, eight runners remained in contention for the medals.

Finland and the Czech Republic, the 2011 and 2010 World Champions respectively, were ranked second and third, while Canada, the defending Olympic champion, was fifth. The most exciting action in the preliminary round came during Russia’s match against the seventh-ranked United States, where a classic Cold War-era showdown led to a 2-2 tie at the end of the third period. After a scoreless overtime, America’s T.J. Oshie knocked four pucks into the net during a shootout to earn his nation a 3-2 victory and automatic qualification for the quarterfinals. Canada, meanwhile, took Group B after an overtime battle against a strong Finnish team, while fourth-ranked Sweden dominated Group C.
For the hosts, perhaps the most tragic moment of the entire Games came during the quarterfinals, where Finland pulled off a 3-1 upset against the Russian team and eliminated them from medal contention. Canada, meanwhile, had a surprisingly difficult time with eleventh-ranked Latvia in its own quarterfinal match, avoiding overtime by less than seven minutes with a goal from Shea Weber. This was not even the closest call for a team playing against the Latvians, as the preliminary rounds saw Switzerland’s Simon Moser score the only point of their match against Latvia with eight seconds of play remaining. With Russia’s surprising exit, all eyes fell on the semifinal matchup between Canada and the United States, but hopes for a repeat of the epic 2010 gold medal game were dashed as Canada skated to an easy 1-0 victory in a supremely-defended, but otherwise uninteresting game. The final, although touted as a rematch of the Olympic final twenty years earlier (where Sweden won 3-2 in a shootout) was equally anti-climactic. Sweden, who had bested Finland 2-1 in the semifinals, failed to withstand an invigorated and determined Canada team, losing the match 3-0. The bronze medal game brought an even larger shutout, with Finland capturing the final podium spot with a 5-0 victory.
Canada thus became the first nation to defend a men’s Olympic ice hockey title since the Soviet Union in 1988, and the first to go undefeated through a tournament since the 1984 Soviets. Finland’s Teemu Selänne also had an excellent Olympics: in addition to tying Raimo Helminen’s record for Olympic ice hockey appearances (6), he also set the record for career Olympic goals (43) and was named tournament MVP. Phil Kessel was the leading scorer, with five goals and three assists, while Sweden’s Erik Karlsson also had eight points, with four goals and four assists.
Sweden’s Nicklas Bäckström tested positive for pseudoephedrine, allegedly from an allergy medication, and was forced to miss the final. The International Olympic Committee, World Anti-Doping Agency, and the International Ice Hockey Federation agreed that the offence was minor enough for him to be allowed to keep his silver medal after a reprimand.

The decision was made to withdrew one of their teams and enter a composite crew made of the two man champions Ostler and Nieberl, together with the two heaviest members of the other German foursome. This proved to be a winning combination and the crew posted the fastest time of all four runs to win the championships and Ostler became the first man to do the two man / four man double at an Olympic Games.

The final was run with an aiding 2.8 m/s wind but Rudolph’s time of 11.0 (11.18) was still shockingly fast, though it could not be ratified as a world record because of the wind assistance. A few days later, Rudolph would add the 200 metre gold medal and anchored the Americans to a gold in the 4×100.

An injury to a horse causing a withdrawal could mean the difference between a medal and last place on the leader board.
After the Netherlands and then Great Britain had challenged the usual regime for the first four Olympic cycles of the century, Germany had re-established their traditional place at the head of the dressage rankings and their combinations made up half of the top 20 in the world. Germany approached Tokyo having won gold at the 2017 and 2019 European Championship and at the hurricane-interrupted World Equestrian Games of 2018. In fact, with the experienced trio of Isabell Werth,   Jessica Von Bredow-Werndl and Dorothee Schneider making the German team, more interest settled on which of five nations would fill the podium positions behind them.
Schneider, recently recovered from a broken collarbone that was caused when one of her possible Olympic horses had collapsed and died of an Aortic rupture when the pair were doing a lap of honour after a competition in Pforzheim, provided Germany with a good start. This was built upon by the veteran Werth and then by a spectacular performance from Bredow-Werndl that confirmed a German team as Olympic champion for the 13th time in the 16th Summer Olympic Games since the event was restored in 1964.
Behind Germany in a best ever finish of second place came a US team that included two former German riders in Steffen Peters and Sabine Schut-Kery. Schut-Kery made the difference between silver and bronze for the Americans with an impressive performance on her horse Sanceo. Great Britain, led by three-time Olympic champion Charlotte Dujardin, finished in a clear third place, with Denmark and the Netherlands finishing well ahead of the other finalists.

Germany dominated this event.  In the first round, the top score was posted by Kurt Behrens, while in the semi-finals he was second to the United States’ George Gaidzik.  The winner in the finals, however, was the 18-year-old Albert Zürner, who narrowly defeated Behrens and whose main claim to fame was having been Champion of Hamburg (Germany) for the past four years.  Tieing for third with Gaidzik was Gottlob Walz, who was the heavy favorite.  Walz had won the platform competition at the 1906 Olympic Games, was an 11-time German champion, and had won the European championship three times, first in 1903.

There were two groups of entries: Reliefs and Medals and Sculptors Works (free-standing figures). The jury for sculpture consisted of the people Haig Patigian (1876-1950), San Francisco; Lloyd Rollins (1890-1970), San Francisco; Henry Hering (1874-1949), New York; and Salvatore Cartaino Scarpitta (1887-1948), Hollywood; all well-known sculptors and art historians in the United States. Also on the jury was the Swedish sculptor Carl Milles (1875-1955).
The gold medal was presented to Polish medalist Józef Klukowski for his Sport Sculpture II. He also won a silver medal for Soccer player at the 1936 Art Competitions in Berlin. In 1944 he was killed during transport between concentration camps, when he was being moved from Mauthausen to Bergen-Belsen. His badge was presented to the champion Polish ski jumper Stanisław Marusarz the same year, whose father preserved it after World War II. At an exhibition at the Museum of Sport and Tourism at Warszawa in 2000-01 the badge was re-discovered, as Marusarz’ trophies were displayed.
US silver medal winner Frederick MacMonnies ( Lindbergh Medal ) later married Alice Jones, sister of tennis players Marion and Georgina Jones who took part in the 1900 Paris Games.
The bronze medal was won by Canadian Tait McKenzie, the only art Olympian to take part in five Olympic Games 1912-48. His Shield of the Athletes was only one of 44 works he submitted to the Los Angeles Art Competitions. He was a Canadian-born American, who after World War I specialized in the care and rehabilitation of severely wounded soldiers, and earned honors in the Canadian and American Scout Movement. During his medical studies at McGill University in Montréal, McKenzie was known as a versatile athlete.

The leader at the time was Luxembourg’s Marc Girardelli, but the Norwegian fans went crazy when Aamodt bested his time by 0.34 seconds. The next skier was American Tommy Moe, who was a solid skier on the World Cup circuit but had never won a World Cup race. No matter, for Moe went ahead, edging Aamodt by 0.04 seconds. As the remaining skiers came down, Moe’s time held up for an unlikely gold medal. He would never again win a World Cup downhill race, and would win only one other World Cup race ever, a super-G later in March 1994. The 1994 downhill was one of the closest ever overall as less than one second separated the first 15 finishers.

After that, Heiki Nabi of Estonia, the 2012 Olympic silver medalist, who captured his first World title a decade previous in 2006, and a second in 2013 (along with a 2014 World bronze) was looking for a spot on the podium.
En route to the final round, López and Kayaalp dominated each of their first three Olympic matches with both not allowing an opponent a single point on them. All three of Kayaalp’s preliminary matches ended earlier than the allotted time – two were won by technical fall, and one by him pinning his opponent just after the first minute. López defeated Sergey Semyonov of Russia in the semi-finals by a score of 3-0, while Kayaalp beat Eduard Popp of Germany 8-0.
And in what was the third straight year that López and Kayaalp have met in a final round of a major international tournament, they faced off for Olympic gold in Rio in a very chippy match. López beat Kayaalp 6-0, to became just the third wrestler to win three Olympic gold medals in Greco-Roman joining legend Soviet/Russian wrestler Aleksandr Karelin as the only two to win all three Greco golds consecutively. The win also put López in a tie for most wrestling medals all-time across all disciplines.
The bronze medals went to Azerbaijan’s Sabah Şəriəti and Russia’s Sergey Semyonov.

The final was effectively over in the first lap when Christie tried a kamikaze maneuver on the inside, resulting in a crash with Fontana and Park. Li, who was in the lead at the time and the only skater left standing, effectively performed an exhibition to win the gold. Although Christie got up to cross the line second, she was unsurprisingly disqualified. Fontana finished in the silver medal position with Park the bronze.

China had won two of the four World Cup races in 2021/22, with Netherlands and ROC grabbing the other wins. In addition, Hungary had made the podium twice.
Just four of the 12 competing teams were eliminated in the quarter-finals, but notably among them was Republic of Korea, historically the most successful nation in short-track speed skating. More upsets came in the semi-finals, as the Netherlands crashed out in the first heat, at the hands of their star racer, Suzanne Schulting. The second heat saw both ROC and USA disqualified, after lengthy video reviews. Particularly the American’s dismissal, which favored the home Chinese team, was considered controversial.
Italy grabbed the early lead in the final, but China slipped ahead with a great maneuver by Ren Ziwei, followed by Canada. With slightly over six laps to go, Canada’s Florence Brunelle collided with Zsófia Konya of Hungary, for which Canada would later be penalized. This left China with a seemingly comfortable lead over Italy. But after the last exchange, Pietro Sighel closed the gap to Wu Dajing, even making an attempt to pip the Chinese at the finish line. It was just short of the gold, though, leaving China to win its first gold medal of the 2022 Olympic Winter Games.

The throw was so long that it started to raise safety concerns. He was close to literally throwing the javelin out of the stadium – or at least the infield – and putting runners or spectators in danger. Partly because of this, the javelin specifications were shortly thereafter changed, and a new implement was in use from April 1986, although the changes had been initiated before the 1984 Olympics, in an effort to change the javelin center-of-gravity and allow for more frequent tip-first landings, making it easier to judge. Without Hohn nobody was favored in Los Angeles. Tom Petranoff (USA) led the qualifiers with 85.96 (282-0¼) but would finish only 10th in the final. The gold was won by Finland’s Arto Härkönen, continuing his nation’s tradition in the javelin. He was the first left-hander to win the Olympic javelin.

Kiely was fifth after four events but then his great strength in the weight throws pulled him into the lead after the eighth event and he held on to win. The individual event marks for all competitors were below par, mostly due to the conditions as the all-around was contested on a day that it rained continuously and the track was noted to be flooded at various locations and muddy throughout.
There has been some controversy in the Journal of Olympic History as to whether this was an Olympic event.  Decathlon expert Frank Zarnowski leads the naysayers, but the IOC continues to recognize this as an Olympic event. In addition, photos exist of Kiely’s medal, which contains the term “Olympic Games” above the ribbon holding the medal. A trophy was also made for Kiely to celebrate his victory which contains the term “Olympic Games, St. Louis, U.S.A.” on it.

After reasonable showings at the 2008 and 2012 Olympics, placing 9th and 6th respectively, they came to Rio as the reigning 2016 world champions. They had been among the top 470 crews since 2009, when they won their first title, and over the following years added two silver and three bronze medals at the World Championships, as well as three gold and two bronze medals at the Europeans. In the preliminaries, Croatia was a class of its own. With two race wins and never placing worse than 6th (8th in the excluded score) they totaled only 27 points before the medal race. Also performing well were the boats from Australia and Greece. Panagiotis Mantis and Pavlos Kagialis went into the medal race with 38 points, two points ahead of Australia’s Mathew Belcher and Will Ryan. Australia had won the last two gold medals in the 470 class, with Belcher attempting to retain the 2012 gold he won with 2008 gold medalist Malcolm Page, who retired after the last Olympics. All other teams, including the 2008 and 2012 silver medalist Great Britain, were out of contention for a medal.
The men’s and women’s 470 finals had to be postponed by one day due to extremely low wind. In the medal race, the three leading crews disregarded all other boats just trying to control each other. Croatia won easily with an 8th place and won the country’s first ever sailing gold medal. Australia’s 9th place in a tight battle was just good enough to snatch silver from the Greeks with 58 points each but won thanks to their higher finish in the medal race.

Ivanov had won the event at the last two Olympics, two of the last three editions of the European Championships, and the inaugural World Championships in 1962. Furthermore, James Hill of New Zealand, the reigning British Empire and Commonwealth champion, did not attend the Tokyo Olympics, while Sy Cromwell of the United States, the latest Pan American and Diamond Challenge Sculls title holder, competed only in the double sculls. Thus the only participants who appeared even remotely likely to challenge Ivanov were Switzerland’s Göpf Kottmann , the 1963 Diamond Challenge Sculls winner, Czechoslovakia’s Václav Kozák, the 1963 European Champion and 1960 Olympic Champion in the double sculls, and Germany’s Achim Hill, the 1960 Olympic runner-up. Rob Groen of the Netherlands, runner-up at the last two Europeans, and Alberto Demiddi of Argentina, runner-up at the most recent Diamond Challenge Sculls, were also dark horse contenders.
In the opening round, however, Ivanov performed poorly and was bested by over ten seconds by American Donald Spero, a two-time national champion in the single sculls whose major international success in the event was limited to bronze at the 1964 European Championships. Achim Hill had the fastest time in the heats, while Ivanov redeemed himself by earning the fastest time in the repêchage. The final was less dramatic: Ivanov finished comfortably ahead of Achim Hill, who in turn was safely ahead of Kottmann in rounding out the podium spots. Spero, perhaps having exhausted himself in the opening round, finished last among the six finalists. Ivanov thus won his third consecutive Olympic gold medal and he was joined in this feat at the Games by American Al Oerter (in athletics’ discus throw) and Dane Paul Elvstrøm (in sailing’s one person dinghy).

But in the second qualifier, White posted the highest score to make the final. In the final, White dominated the first run, with no judge’s score below 9.0. His 46.8 took a huge lead, and held up thru the second round to earn him the gold medal. Kass repeated his silver medal from Salt Lake City. Kass had struggled in the first run, but posted the best score in the second run to move up to second place.

By then Zhirov had already accounted for his main European rival Pietro Aurino and had only to see off the challenge of Korean  Lee Seung-Bae to win gold for Kazakhstan.  Lee had moved up from the middleweight division since winning a bronze medal in Barcelona and was much the smaller man of the two finalists. He was unable to cope with the size and speed of Zhirov and was susceptible to the body punches of the Kazakh fighter. In the final round Zhirov stepped up the place and forced a standing eight count on the Korean.

The Olympic record had been set in 1906 at Athens by another British runner, Henry Hawtrey, who had recorded 26:11.8 on the tight Athens track.  With Shrubb not eligible no real favorite existed.  America had no top distance runners, and Britain had failed to produce a dominant distance man to replace Shrubb.

Dolan’s stock rose when he won his favoured 400 IM just as Sievinen’s fell when he failed to reach the final.

A month after the Games it was revealed how lucky Czene was to be competing in Atlanta. A few weeks prior to the Olympics he had still not recorded a qualifying time so the Hungarian Swimming Federation invented a non-existent meeting and submitted concocted times to the IOC to ensure he (and a dozen other swimmers) were eligible to compete in Atlanta.

With no strong favorite, everybody in the field had a chance to get on the podium.
Two medalists from the 2012 Olympic Games were competing – the gold medalist from Azerbaijan Toğrul Əsgərov, and the bronze medalist Yogeshwar Dutt of India, who was competing in his fourth Olympic Games. Other contenders were world-ranked number one Frank Chamizo of Italy, the 2015 World champion who had lost Asgarov in the European final; the 2014 World champion and 2015 bronze medalist Soslan Ramonov from Russia, and two-time World bronze medalist (2013, 2014) Ganzorigiin Mandakhnaran of Mongolia.
In the end, it was Ramonov beating the defending Olympic champion Asgarov (60 kg) in just two minutes five seconds in the gold medal bout. He scored 11 unanswered points, winning 11-0 on technical points in a bout that was much harder than the score line indicated.
The much-decorated Asgarov (2010 World silver medalist, 2012 European champion, 2015 European Games gold medalist), who captured his second Olympic medal in as many Games, felt great fatigue after a tough semi-final against Italian Chamizo, who went on to earn the bronze medal beating American Frank Molinaro.
The other bronze medal match had the Mongolian Mandakhnaran leading his opponent Ikhtiyor Navruzov of Uzbekistan, 7-6 and he started celebrating with only seconds left. The judges, however, awarded a penalty point because Mandakhnaran was not engaging with an opponent during the match and with the score tied at 7-7, Navruzov was awarded the victory by virtue of earning the last point. What proceeded was an epic meltdown from Mandakhnaran’s coaches, who stripped down to their underwear, which only prompted the referees to award Navruzov another penalty point for the Mongolian outburst following the match. Mandakhnaran refused to accept the decision and walked away from the referee who was about hold the hand up of Navruzov to make the match official.

Schulting had been the better of the two earlier in the year, winning two World Cups, but the overall standings were led by Korea’s Lee Yu-Bin. The defending champion and 2018 and 2019 World Champion Choi Min-Jeong was also a serious title contender, having already won silver in the 1,000 m.
Despite some issues with the timing and lap counter controls, the quarter-finals went as expected. The semi-finals were mostly the same, with Lee and Fontana eliminating Kim Boutin, bronze medalist in the 500 m, in the first heat. Schulting and Hanne Desmet dominated the second semi-final, while Choi bettered the Olympic record in the final heat, with Han Yutong and Xandra Velzeboer tagging along.
Han attempted to pull away from the field early in the final, with Schulting quickly catching up. The two did not press, and the rest of the field reconnected, with Choi now taking charge. At three laps to go, Schulting attempted to pass Han, but was pushed to the outside, dropping her back behind Fontana. Schulting quickly passed Han on the next opportunity, but with the high pace set by Choi, there were no further options for passing.
This made Choi the third 2018 female short-track skater to retain her 2018 title, after Fontana (500 m) and Schulting (1,000 m), and with all three of them ending up on the podium.

There is only marginal justification for considering this an Olympic event.
Three teams competed in the 1904 water polo event: New York Athletic Club, Chicago Athletic Association, and Missouri Athletic Club.  The New York AC defeated Missouri 5-0 and Chicago 6-0.  A fourth team tried to enter representing Germany.  However, the Germans were not allowed to compete because their athletes did not represent a single club.  This discrimination should probably eliminate water polo as an Olympic event in 1904, but it is still recognized by the IOC.
A sad footnote did occur after the water polo event.  The artificial lake created in the middle of the World’s Fair for the life-saving exhibition was also used for some of the agricultural exhibits, and many of the cattle at the agricultural exhibits grazed in, and wandered into the lake.  Although the swimming and water polo events were held at the other end of the lake from the cattle, before the middle of 1905, less than one year after the water polo events in the lake, four of the water poloists died from typhus.

However, in view of their previous performances in PyeongChang, Norway and the young Olympic Athletes from Russia were considered as favorites ahead of the Swedes. Since the introduction of two different styles in cross-country skiing, the relay consists of two legs in the classical style, and two in the freestyle. After the first 3.3 km lap, Kazakhstan’s best skier Aleksey Poltoranin increased the pace and dominated the field of 14 teams, closely followed by the Russian Andrey Larkov. To the first exchange, the third and fourth teams, Italy and France, came about ten seconds back and favorites Norway with Didrik Tønseth 18 seconds behind. In the third lap, Sweden’s Jens Burman started to lose contact and came to the first exchange 37 seconds behind the leader Poltoranin.
Aleksandr Bolshunov, the second skier for the OAR, quickly pulled away from the chasing group consisting of Italy, France and Norway’s veteran Martin Johnsrud Sundby. Sundby held back letting Maurice Manificat do most of the leader’s work. Due to the lack of co-operation in the chasing group, Bolshunov managed to extend his lead to 40 seconds at one stage before ending the second exchange nearly 25 seconds ahead of Italy’s Francesco De Fabiani, 28 seconds ahead of France, with Norway a further four seconds adrift, handing over to the third skier, the first freestyle skater. With almost two minutes behind at the half-way mark, Sweden had virtually given up on the battle for a medal.
On the third leg, skiathlon gold medalist Simen Hegstad Krüger took control and clocked the fastest time of the leg, almost 50 seconds faster than Aleksey Chervotkin for the Olympic Athletes from Russia. Led by Krüger, the chasing group closed in on Chervotkin on the second round of the leg, outrunning him on the climb from the stadium. The top three teams at the third exchange were Norway and France within one second of each other, and the OAR 16 seconds behind. While Frenchman Clément Parisse lost less than 5 seconds to the Norwegian front-runner, Italy’s Giandomenico Salvadori could not hold on to the top group and lost 1:20 min, slipping from second to fifth.
The fourth and final leg was determined by the tactics of Norway’s final skier Johannes Høsflot Klæbo. Already having won one gold in PyeongChang in the individual sprint, he started with a leisurely pace so that Adrien Backscheider from France had to take the lead allowing Denis Spitsov to close the gap again for the Olympic Athletes from Russia. Spitsov even took the lead, when the runners passed the stadium for the last time. With the now faster pace, Backscheider lost contact but eventually secured the bronze medal for France. On a small downhill stretch, Klæbo made one of his famous kick-starts and stormed to Norway’s first men’s relay gold since 2002 carrying the Norwegian flag over the finish line. Short distance specialist and double medalist in PyeongChang, Denis Spitsov, had to settle for silver, approximately 10 seconds behind, in what was a great success for the team of youngsters. The bronze medal for France was certainly based on their strength as a team. Finland came from behind and finished fourth, ahead of the disappointed Swedish team, and Germany. The Finns had to replace Ristomatti Hakola, sixth in the sprint, by Perttu Hyvarinen, who lost almost a minute on the first leg. Their last runner, Lari Lehtonen could not do anything more than keep Sweden and Germany at bay.
Like Sweden four years earlier in Sochi, Norway won both the women’s and men’s relays in PyeongChang. Klæbo would later also win gold in the team sprint, finishing with three gold medals in PyeongChang.

Presumably the sport was discontinued because of the many controversies that surrounded it. There were several inter-national disputes at the earlier Olympics, but the 1920 Olympic tug-of-war event was conducted in peace.
Great Britain won the tournament easily, winning all six of its pulls. Their team consisted of several former and current members of the London police. Three of the team members, Frederick Humphreys, Edwin Mills, and James Shepherd, won their third medals and second gold medals. They had been on the silver medal team in 1912 and the gold medal team in 1908. John Sewell also won a second medal, having been on the 1912 runner-up team.
The writing of the 1920 Official Report was restricted mostly due to the financial problems of the Organizing Committee that occurred after the Games were finished. It resulted in a simple typed report, of which few copies still exist. In addition, the report was not well written and contained many discrepancies, one of these being the results of the tug-of-war competition. Because of this, for a long time, it had been uncertain which team had really won the tug-of-war silver medal during these Olympics, because both the Americans and the Dutch claimed to have won that silver medal.
This may be illustrated by the fact that in the Official Report, the final result of the competition in “Traction á la corde” (Tug-of-war) was:
1  Grande-Bretagne (Great-Britain)
2  Hollande (The Netherlands)
3  Belgique (Belgium)
The Official Report gave a detailed description of the tug-of-war competition, which was held on 17-18 August. The last sentences of that description read:
“L’Italie déclara forfait devant les Etats-Unis. Les Etats-Unis devaient tirer contre la Hollande pour la seconde place, mais, par suite d’une erreur, l’équipe hollandaise quitta Anvers et ne revint pas pour ce match. Les Etats-Unis se trouveurent de ce fait en seconde place.”
According to this description, “the Dutch team should have pulled against the American team for second place, but because the Dutch team had already returned home, the second place was then awarded to the United States.”  However, this is incorrect. The Dutch team did complete in the modified Bergvall competition for second place, defeating Belgium two pulls to none. In fact, in the third-place competition, the United States may have left early, and not pulled against Belgium for the bronze medal. It is not certain if the final match took place, but Belgium certainly won the bronze medal.
We list nine British athletes although only eight could pull at a time. We originally included Ernest Thorne and still have him in the results. The great-granddaughter of Alfred Read, however, has contacted us with documentary evidence that her great-grandfather was on the team and won a gold medal, and provided photographs. Thorne is not in the photographs, but it is possible that Read and Thorne pulled in different matches – there are no detailed results for tug-of-war from the 1920 Antwerpen Olympics.

That race turned out to be rather uneventful, with Germany leading by about a second for most of the race, and even extending their lead in the final laps. In the bronze medal race, the Japanese ladies seemed to emulate their 2005 World Championship performance, but a fall cost them a medal, the bronze instead going to the Russian ladies.

In the opening round, it was the American trio of Dan Ayrault, Conn Findlay, and Kurt Seiffert who posted the fastest time, while the Polish crew of Henryk Jagodziński, Zbigniew Schwarzer, and Berthold Mainka took that honor in the semi-finals. These four nations advanced to the finals, where they were fairly evenly matched. The first half saw Poland and the USSR contest for the lead, until both the Germans and the Americans initiated drives to claim the top podium spot. Poland, who had taken the lead from the Soviets, had no answer for this push and dipped into third place as the United States claimed gold and the Germans took silver. Poland and the Soviet Union were neck and neck approaching the finish line, but the latter pulled ahead just in time to claim bronze by a margin of 0.5 seconds. One of the Americans, Findlay, would go on to win three more Olympic medals, one of which was bronze in the two person keelboat, mixed yachting event at the 1976 Games. His most notable yachting success, however, came in 1977, when he served on the crew of the America Cup-winning _ Courageous_.

There were 22 fencers who fenced 12 matches, eight in the French style and four used the Italian style. One interesting note about the foil demonstration is that one woman fenced against the men, Millicent Hall, who was the British ladies’ foil champion in 1907-08 and 1922.
There were no real final standings because the event was meant to demonstrate the different styles of foil fencing being practiced in the 12 countries and those styles were so different that there was no basis for comparing them to each other.  No scores were kept during the bouts. The description of the event in the 1908 Official Report says that neither hits scored nor form were used to award touches: “To base decisions purely on the hits scored encourages a degraded form of foil-play, and the differences of style in so many nations would have made it an invidious matter to take form into consideration.”

The USA was in from the 2011 World Cup standings, joined by second-ranked Italy, and third-ranked China, the 2008 bronze medalists. Five nations qualified via continental tournaments (Algeria, Dominican Republic, Japan, Turkey, and the defending champions Brazil). In May 2012 a World Qualifier added Russia, Korea (South), and Serbia. Host nation Great Britain was also given a spot in the London tournament. Britain had never competed in volleyball at the Olympics previously, for either men or women, but their women did manage one victory in pool play, defeating Algeria.
In Pool A, Russia won all five matches to advance over Italy, Japan, and the Dominican Republic. The United States dominated Pool B, winning all five matches, while losing only two sets. Brazil struggled, placing fourth in the pool to narrowly advance to the knock-out stage. Brazil faced Russia in the quarter-finals, and survived in five sets, winning 21-19 in the fifth. The United States continued their dominance, defeating the Dominican Republic in the quarters, and Korea in the semis, both by 3-0 scores.
After Brazil defeated Japan easily in the semis, 3-0, the final was a repeat of the Beijing final. This had also happened in 1972-76, with Japan and the Soviet Union meeting in the final match. Japan and the Soviets had also been the top two in 1964-68, but that was a purely round-robin format.
The United States, based on their easy path in London, seemed poised to win their first-ever women’s volleyball gold, after silvers in 1984 and 2008, and a bronze in 1992. But they were crushed in the first set of the final, 25-11, and although they won the second set, Brazil romped to a 3-1 victory to defend their gold medal – 25-11, 17-25, 25-20, 25-17. Their second consecutive gold was added to bronze medals won by Brazilian women in 1996 and 2000.
Japan had once been the dominant women’s nation in volleyball, winning the inaugural Olympic gold in 1964, and adding silvers in 1968-72, and another gold in 1976. But they had not won an Olympic medal since a bronze in 1984. In London, they were seeded #3 by the FIVB and the seedings held as they defeated Korea for the bronze medal in straight sets, to earn their sixth Olympic medal, equalling the former Soviet Union for the most ever in women’s Olympic volleyball, although in 1992 the Unified Team also won silver in women’s volleyball.

At the first extra end Schmirler threw her last stone knowing that the shot would have to be perfect to win her the game. The stone edged just a few centimetres inside the British stone and took Canada through to meet Denmark in the inaugural Olympic final.

Although the German world record holder Herbert Klein  was in the field there was no clear favourite for this race and the evenly matched performances of some of the main contenders in the heats and semi-finals did not help to resolve the issue of favouritism. Klein led the final at the halfway stage but was passed by Australia’s John Davies  and Bowen Stassforth of the USA over the second half of the race. Although Davies had finished fourth in this event in 1948 in London, his victory in Helsinki was unexpected.

For Arlt and Wendl these were their fifth Olympic gold medals, equalling the Olympic best in the sport set by their countrywoman, Natalie Geisenberger, who had won in the women’s singles the day before.
Arlt and Wendl became the first identical team to become three-time winners in a non-individual Winter Olympic event or sport. This has only been previously achieved at either Summer or Winter Olympics by Pavol and Peter Hochschorner (Slovakia) in Canadian doubles slalom (2000-08), Venus and Serena Williams (USA) in women’s doubles tennis (2000-12), and Kerri Walsh Jennings and Misty May-Treanor (USA) in women’s beach volleyball (2004-12).
The Austrian pair of Thomas Steu and Lorenz Koller won the bronze medal. This was the 10th medal in this event for Austria, ranking them third behind Germany and the German Democratic Republic.
For Eggert and Benecken, this was their second consecutive medal in the event, after winning bronze at PyeongChang 2018. Germany won its sixth gold medal and 12th medal in total in this event, both of which lead the medal table.

He was at this time unequaled as a discus thrower and as an all-around athlete.  Born in Bohola, County Mayo, Ireland, Martin Sheridan emigrated to the United States in 1900, following his brother, Richard, who had come over in 1897.  Richard Sheridan quickly established himself in the United States as a discus thrower.  Martin Sheridan also took up the event and quickly became the best in the world at it.  Sheridan stood 6’3) and weighed 195 lbs. in his prime.
In the era when Sheridan competed, there was no official governing body that recognized world records.  Various sources credit him with between seven and sixteen world records.  Sheridan’s Olympic fame rests primarily on winning the Olympic gold medal in the discus in 1904, 1906, and 1908.  But he was far more than just a discus thrower.  Overall, he won nine Olympic medals, including five gold, counting those Sheridan won in the 1906 Olympics.
Sheridan was a superb jumper and weight thrower, but he displayed his other talents in the all-around championship, the early American forerunner of the decathlon.  Sheridan entered three all-arounds in his athletic career, the AAU National Championships of 1905, 1907, and 1909.  He won each of them easily, and set a world record each time, finally leaving it at 7,385 points, a mark which Jim Thorpe broke by only a few points in 1912.  Sheridan also won the AAU discus championship in 1904, 1906, 1907, and again in 1911, just before his retirement as an athlete.
Off the field, Sheridan worked as a policeman (1902-1918) as did many of the Irish-American athletes.  His fame led him to be the personal bodyguard for the governor of New York whenever he visited the city.  Sheridan never married and died without issue from pneumonia only seven years after he retired from athletics.  In the New York Herald-Tribune, his obituary proclaimed him to be the greatest all-around athlete ever known in the United States - greater even than Jim Thorpe.  Thorpe himself stated in the obituary, “Sheridan was the greatest athlete in the world.  He could do things I never could.”

Competitors losing to the finalists entered repechage tournament for bronze medals.,na,"Mehdi Taghavi of Iran was the reigning World and Asian Champion in men’s welterweight freestyle wrestling, titles he had also won in 2009, and was considered the favorite to win the Olympic crown at the 2012 Games. The defending Olympic champion was Ramazan Şahin of Turkey, who had been World Champion in 2007 and European Champion in 2008, but had little to show on the international stage since his victory in Beijing. This left the final open for challengers such as Sushil Kumar, a bronze medalist from the 2008 Games and India’s first World Champion wrestler, having won the title in 2010 along with the Commonwealth Games and the Asian Championships. There was also a threat from Russia’s Alan Gogayev, reigning European Champion and runner-up at the 2010 World Championships.
Taghavi and Gogayev were both drawn in the same bracket, but shockingly lost their first rounds to Liván López of Cuba and Zalimkhan Yusupov of Tajikistan respectively. Both were unheralded wrestlers who were not expected to contend for a medal (although López had bronze from the 2011 World Championships) paving the way for Tatsuhiro Yonemitsu of Japan, 2010 Asian Games Champion and runner up at the most recent World Championships and the 2009 Asian Championships, to battle for gold. López and Yusupov’s eventual elimination meant that neither Taghavi nor Gogayev would compete for a medal. In the top half, Kumar defeated Şahin in his opening round and went on to win the bracket and challenge Yonemitsu. The first period of the final was somewhat tame, with the Japanese wrestler scoring the lone point to win. In the second round, Yonemitsu was able to lift the Indian and toss him on his back, scoring three points. Although Kumar was able to score one point, the period, and the gold medal, went to Japan. Neither wrestler went home without a place in the history books, however, as Yonemitsu was Japan’s first male wrestling gold medalist since in 1988 and Kumar was the first Indian wrestler to reach an Olympic final.
In the first bronze medal match, Şahin met Akzhurek Tanatarov of Kazakhstan, who had never reached the podium at a major international event. Şahin was the favorite in the match and lived up to expectations by outscoring Tanatarov 4-1 in the opening period. Tanatarov came back in the second round, however, when, with the score tied 1-1 in the final 10 seconds, scored a winning point with a takedown that gave  him a 3-1 victory following an unsuccessful challenge from the Turkish coaches. The first half of the final period was intense, with the Kazakh outscoring the Turk 4-2, sufficient in the end to win him the round and the bronze medal. For the final podium spot, López battled Cəbrayıl Həsənov of Azerbaijan, European Champion in 2010 and 2011, runner-up in 2009, and bronze medalist at the last two World Championships. Həsənov won the first round with three points in the final 15 seconds, but López came back strong in the final two periods scoring two unanswered points for his first victory and pinning his opponent in the final 15 seconds of the match for the bronze.

It was therefore a great shock for the nation when the Swede Sven Israelsson, in front of a home crowd of 70 000, could as the first foreigner be celebrated as the winner of Nordic Combined in Holmekollen 1947. And that was not enough: Second was the Swiss skier Niklaus Stump, and the best Norwegian Olaf Dufseth had to be satisfied by third place. The Norwegians had been warned.
In St. Moritz the 18 km Cross Country part of Nordic Combined was integrated in the event for the specialists, and the results of the Nordic Combined participants counted for this event. Out of 84 starters, 39 of them participated in the combined event.
The day brought another shock to the Norwegians, this time coming from their Finnish neighbors. One of the youngest participants in the competition, the 21 year old and unmerited Heikki Hasu, outclassed his opponents and was almost 3 minutes ahead of his countryman, the more merited Martti Huhtala. The best Norwegian in third place, Olav Odden, was beaten by Hasu with almost 5 minutes, and Israelsson and Stump, both considered as having their best event in jumping, were close behind Odden. Hasu’s excellent race placed him 4th among the specialist, only 36 seconds behind the bronze winner.
In the jumping event the day after, each skier had 3 jumps, and only the two best jumps counted. Hasu jumped safely and won the gold medal with a clear margin. Israelsson was the best jumper of all, but was not able to catch Huhtala in the battle for silver and had to settle for bronze. Stump advanced  from 7th to 4th place. For the Norwegians, the jumping event went even worse than the cross country part. Odden jumped badly and fell down to 11th place. Their best jumper, Eilert Dahl, placed 8th in the jumping event and could advance to a 6th place in the final results. The US skiers Gordon Wren and Corey Engen impressed by coming 2nd and 3rd in the jumping event, but were too far behind in the cross country race to fight for a top placing in the final ranking.
Some of the lost Norwegian pride was restored in Holmenkollen a few weeks later, when Simon Slåttvik, aged 30 and coming from the northern part of Norway, won the Nordic Combined with another Norwegian outside the Olympic team, Ottar Gjermundshaug in 2nd place. Huhtala was 3rd and Israelsson a distant 14th, but Hasu and Stump was not taking part. Slåttvik became Norwegian Champion in 1947, but could not raise money enough to travel to the Norwegian Olympic selection competitions early in the 1948 season.

Although nominally amateurs, most of their players were able to dedicate all their time to sports, paid by the state. Their teams would dominate Olympic football tournaments until amateur restrictions were lifted in 1984. The first shock occurred in the qualifying round, as tiny Luxembourg defeated Britain 5-3. Highly anticipated was the Soviet team that had not played any internationals save for two matches against Turkey in the 1920s. They survived the qualifier against Bulgaria after overtime, and then drew 5-5 against Yugoslavia before being eliminated in the replay.
The biggest attraction at the Helsinki football tournament was probably the Hungarian team. Later known as the “Golden Team” at home and the “Mighty Magyars” abroad, the team featured many stars, including the legendary Ferenc Puskás. They defeated 1948 gold medallist Sweden 6-0 in the semis, and 1948 runner- up Yugoslavia in the final for an undisputed title. In 1953, the Hungarian team played one of the most famous matches outside of the World Cups, defeating England at Wembley 6-3. Virtually the same squad was expected to take home the 1954 World Cup in Switzerland, but was upset in the final by West Germany 2-3, in what became known as the “Miracle of Bern”.

Three of the four Norwegians in competition also had sub-9 minute performances listed, all skated at a Frogner meet shortly before the Olympics, World Record holder Harald Strøm being the fastest with 8:52.3.
The second competition of the day got underway with the first two pairs being rescheduled due to non-starters. Charlie Gorman and Léon Quaglia were the first to hit the ice. Quaglia had won the French Championships at the same rink two weeks earlier, and he improved on his performance in the 5000 m by more than 15 seconds: 9.08.6. The first to go under 9 minutes was Frithjof Paulsen of Norway, followed by his compatriot Harald Strøm who listed 8:54.6. Strøm’s time was good, considering that he had caught the flu on the previous day. As the Norwegian flag bearer, he had been out in the rain for hours wearing nothing but his race outfit.
The strongest North American distance skater, Val Bialas was coupled with Julius Skutnabb, and delivered an interesting fight, won by the 34-year-old Finn who also improved the season’s best time to 8:48.4. His teammate Thunberg did not have such a strong competitor in his race, but that did not stop him from outclassing the rest of the field with 8:39.0. The two remaining Norwegians, Larsen and Sigurd Moen, both delivered fine performances, but were also unable to approach the leading Finnish duo.
Thunberg was one of the dominant speed skaters of the era. He only started skating at age 20, but managed to win 5 World Championships and 4 European titles.

There was only one clear favorite, American Ted Ligety. He won the World Championships in giant slalom in both 2011 and 2013 as well as the giant slalom World Cup in 2010/11 and 2012/13.

The current giant slalom World Cup standings saw Hirscher in the lead with Pinturault second, Ligety third, and Fanara fourth.
Pinturault was first down on the first run, and posted a challenging time of 1:22.44. This held the lead until his compatriot Thomas Fanara (FRA) bettered the time by just 0.03 seconds. Shortly afterwards Ligety posted a time of 1:21.08 which put him in the lead after the first run.

Fanara, Mayer and Simoncelli went without challenging the leaders, and for a while Hirscher found himself in bronze medal position. Bank was next on the course but, perhaps with memories of missing out in the Super Combined event when lying second, only managed the 15th fastest second run and slipped down to eventually finish fifth. Going last Ligety did not have the best race, and his 1.50 second lead over Missillier was gradually eroded, but he just held on to post a combined time of 2:45.29 and take the gold medal, ahead of the two Frenchmen.
Ligety won the fifth gold medal at this Games for skiing manufacturer Head, while Salomon won silver and bronze. Ondřej Bank achieved the best ever Alpine skiing result for a Czech men by finishing fifth.

The Finn and fellow teenager Martin Höllwarth filled the first two places at half way with Höllwarth’s fellow Austrian Heinz Kuttin a little further back in third.  The two Austrians consolidated their positions in the second round of jumps but any hopes they had of taking a 1-2 were not to come to pass. Toni Nieminen flew forever and when he landed it was at a point some 6½ metres further than any other jumper. At sixteen years and eight months Nieminen was nearly two years younger than Dick Button and, as of 2010, remains the youngest male individual champion in Winter Games history.

Ukraine had won a silver medal at the 2013 World Championships, but was only thought to have a shot at bronze. But improbably Ukraine came through for the gold medal in a stirring victory. It came shortly after civil unrest in Kyiv had rocked the political world, and IOC President Thomas Bach and Ukrainian IOC Member Sergey Bubka had both called for a halt to violence in the country.
Ukraine took the lead on the second leg as Yuliya Dzhyma shot cleanly to move ahead. She handed Valj Semerenko a 12.1 second lead, which she increased to 28.4 seconds, as anchor skiier Olena Pidhrushna took over. Pidhrushna brought Ukraine home in first, with Russia winning the silver medal (but see below) and Norway the bronze. Ukraine’s victory was a true team effort, as none of their skiiers had the best or second-best performance on any leg, but all of them were either third or fourth for the legs, showing the most consistency of any team.
Germany had a disastrous performance, finishing 11th, as opening skiier Franziska Preuß broke a ski pole, and then after falling, had to clean her rifle before shooting, which had become clogged with snow during the fall. This cost her almost 3 minutes, and she was only 16th after her leg, and the Germans could never make up the time.
The results were altered after the Oswald Commission and the McLaren Report came out in December 2016. Initially, three of the Russian skiiers were disqualified - Yana Romanova, Olga Zaytseva, and Olga Vilukhina - disqualifying the entire team. However, Romanova and Vilukhina were reinstated after appeals, but Zaytseva remained disqualified as did the team. After appeals at the Tribunal Fédéral of Switzerland it was not until 2022 that Norway was officially moved up to a silver medal and Czechia to a bronze medal.

Mukhin, whilst possessing strength and power as was seen in his victories on the way to the final, had a weak chin and had been floored in two of three preliminary bouts. Rademacher bulldozed his way to victory and scored a succession of knockdowns before the referee eventually stopped the fight.
Rademacher duly elected to become a professional and, astonishingly, was granted a challenge to world heavyweight champion Floyd Patterson as his first pro bout. Rademacher was unsurprisingly outclassed and knocked out by Patterson although he did score a knockdown of his own during the fight. He fought on, usually against top quality opponents, until 1962, and won 15 of his 23 fights. He later became a successful businessman.

Already with eight Olympic medals and five golds, to describe him as the favorite was an understatement. The race was held in a steady rain, which made conditions difficult for the skiers. But the Norwegian waxers set up five pairs of skis for Dæhlie who tested them shortly before starting and then chose the best pair.
Dæhlie started fast and had the lead at both of the time checks, with Kazakhstan’s Vladimir Smirnov in second at 6.5 km. Both slowed down in the final kilometers but Dæhlie had done enough to stay ahead, and won the gold medal by eight seconds. The silver medal went to the surprising Austrian Markus Gandler. Gandler had been skiing internationally since the late 1980s but had won little. He started slowly in this race, but had the fastest finishing split from 6.5 km to the line to place second.
This race also saw the appearance of the first black African in cross-country skiing, Philip Boit of Kenya. Boit was last of the 92 finishers, almost eight minutes behind 91st place, Gjoko Dineski of Macedonia. But when he finished, waiting at the line for his arrival was Bjørn Dæhlie, who embraced him after his finish. After 1998 this race was not held at the 2002 or 2006 Winter Olympics, replaced by the 15 km.

Niskanen, whose sister Kerttu missed out on gold in a heartbeat final against Therese Johaug the previous day, never left any doubts about his victory. Each of the three intermediate times saw him in first place. At the finish line, he was 23.2 seconds ahead of Bolshunov and, after the team sprint in 2014 and the 50-kilometer race in 2018, won Olympic gold for the third time.
Bolshunov was in second place at the halfway mark, 11.4 seconds slower than Niskanen. Klæbo was 37.5 seconds behind at the finish, having come back from 20th place at the first intermediate time. After his poor showing in the skiathlon (40th), the 2018 three-time Olympic champion was much stronger and was happy about taking bronze. Known for his prowess in sprint competitions, he showed that he could contend in distance events as well.

It had been on the World Championship program since 1994. In 2011 she had become the first New Zealand woman to win a World Championship in canoeing with her victory in this event, but she would certainly have her share of challengers in London. Hungary’s Natasa Douchev-Janics, for example, had 18 World Championship victories, three of which were the K-1 200 titles that came before Carrington’s. Furthermore, Douchev-Janics had taken the 2011 season off for pregnancy and certainly would have challenged Carrington for the crown had she been present, for she returned to the sport with a victory in the event at the 2012 European Championships. Ukrainian Inna Osypenko-Radomska, an Olympic and World Champion in the K-1 500, was also competing in the inaugural K-1 200 and was certain to be a threat, having been runner-up in the event at the 2010 World Championships. With Maria Teresa Portela of Spain, the 2002 and 2005 World Champion, and Nataliya Lobova of Russia, the 2011 European Champion, thrown into the mix, there were many paddlers in the race with the skill to capture a podium spot.
Douchev-Janics and Carrington met up in the qualification heats, with the former edging out the New Zealander by just under two-tenths of a second to claim the fastest time of the round. Carrington had her revenge in the semi-finals, setting a new quickest time in a round where all of the medal prospects survived to compete for gold. In the final it was Carrington who came out of the start fastest, leading the pack by a thin margin throughout the race and finishing a comfortable distance ahead of them to capture Olympic gold. Osypenko, meanwhile, edged out Douchev-Janics by less than eight-hundredths of a second to claim silver, forcing the Hungarian to settle for bronze.

The race was longer, at 221.85 km., more in keeping with the length of professional classics. And each nation was allowed to have five riders, rather than the standard three, to allow the nations’ teams to work together more, similar to the professional peleton. It was difficult to choose a favorite for the race. Spain’s Miguel Induráin, who had won the Tour de France was in the race, his first Olympic appearance since 1984. But he had lost the 1996 Tour de France, and was not a great sprinter or classics rider. The race came down to a three-man break, consisting of Pascal Richard (FRA), Rolf Sørensen (DEN), and Max Sciandri (GBR), who got away with 33 km. remaining. Richard won the sprint for the gold medal. The Americans had hoped for a medal on their home course, but had to settle for fourth place, as Frankie Andreu won a three-rider sprint for the 4th-6th places.
There were 183 riders from 57 nations in the race, but one more country had also attempted to enter the event. Eritrea had gained independence from Ethiopia in 1993, but was not yet recognized by the IOC, failing to meet the minimum requirement of five national sports federations. They had only a cycling federation, which sent Yonas Zekerias and Bekeret Zere to Atlanta apparently in ignorance of the IOC decision. But they were not allowed to compete.

This would be a repeat of the 2011 World Championship final where teenager Sun Yujie had defeated her vastly more experienced teammate Li Na. Things did not go to plan although not perhaps in the wild, erratic manner of the men’s event. Li Na was despatched by Britta Heidemann in the round of 16 and when the dust settled only Sun of the top 10 seeds remained in contention at the semi-final stage.
The first semi-final saw a monumental upset when Yana Shemiakina fought a brilliant tactical fight to eliminate Sun Yujie but even this was overshadowed by the controversial finish to the other semi. Heidemann and Korea’s Sin A-Lam fought a low scoring, cagey bout which was tied at 5-all as time began to run out. What happened next is a source of great controversy and has never entirely been explained in its entirety. What appears to have happened is this; the two women score simultaneous hits which nullified each other’s score but brought the clock down to one second.
They quickly attacked again and once more scored simultaneously but the clock did not move.
In top level fencing the referee’s duties are separated from that of the timekeeper and the timekeeper presses a button to start the clock only after the call of “Allez!” from the referee.
If the timekeeper is slow in pressing the button the electronic system can register a hit in a fraction of a section.
At 0:01, Heidemann anticipates the call and begins her attack early, with another double hit as the result. There is only a tiny fraction of a second between the time starting when the timekeeper presses the button and stopping automatically when Heidemann’s point is depressed. As a result, the time still shows 0:01. The two restart and, amazingly, the same scenario occurs once more with a double hit and no time taken off the clock. What now seems to happen is that the timekeeper mistakenly restarts the clock and time runs out. Since the clock has been running without the two fencers in action it is obvious that an error has occurred so the referee orders the countdown clock to be reset to 0:01. Heidemann is again quick off the mark but this time she clearly scores a hit and seemingly earns her place in the final. As a distraught Sin begins sobbing the Korean coach quickly launches an appeal against the decision. After viewing television replays the decision is upheld but the Korean coach orders Sin to stay on the platform until a further appeal to the FIE is considered. Sin waits for an hour before being gently escorted away when the second appeal is also rejected
The written appeal read as follows (sic):
“Dear DT Members, I can’t agree the decision of the referee, because it rested 1 second and there were 3 times coup double and the time always rests 1 second and they fixed time because the
time passed and 1 second rest. German fencer attempt by fente and remise but one second rests still. It can’t be possible during 1 second 4 actions. Who can believe this situation? I want fix this situation calculating time. Korean team cannot accept this situation.”
Sin would later face more heartbreak when she lost the bronze medal bout against Sun.
After the drama of the semi-finals the gold medal decider between Yana Shemiakina and Britta Heidemann could well have been an anti-climax. Indeed when the first period was ended prematurely by the referee because of the lack of combativity shown by the two finalists it seemed to be heading that way. Thankfully the action soon heated up with the score at the end of the final period tied with 8 points apiece. Heidemann played the aggressor in the extra time but, after two double hits, she missed with an attempted fleche and was wide open to a counter from the Ukrainian who took advantage to win gold.

But this still left one of the deepest fields ever in the Olympic history of the event, promising a terrific showdown for one of the most televised medal events of the Games.

The halfpipe final was comprised of four Americans, three Japanese, two Australians, two Swiss and one Finn. White, who had set a high bar in qualifying with a best score of 98.50 points, would need that advantage going into the finals and dropping in last, knowing what he had to do to beat his rivals.

Australia’s Scotty James, came out strong on his first run, scoring 92.00 points. With his second run, 19-year-old Hirano staked a claim to the podium with an impressive comeback, having fallen on his first run earning only 35.25 points and in 10th place. With Hirano landing back-to-back double cork 1440s, White then set a record of 97.75 points for the highest score in the Olympic men’s halfpipe final. The back-to-back combination of 1440-degree tricks that White executed in his final run was the first time he’d ever done that. Both Hirano and James fell in their third and final run.
White became the first snowboarder to win three Olympic gold medals, his first coming 12 years previous at Torino 2006 and second at Vancouver 2010 (he was fourth at Sochi 2014). His 2018 title marked the 100th Olympic Winter Games gold medal for the United States.
Hirano was denied Olympic gold by the 31-year-old veteran White by less than 2.50 points and won his second career Olympic silver medal.  In winning the bronze medal, James who was Australia’s youngest male Olympian in 2010 in 50 years, won Australia’s second medal in PyeongChang.

Ties broken by lightest bodyweight.,na,"In the men’s heavyweight weightlifting event at the 2012 Summer Olympics, three potential favorites withdrew from the competition before it even began. Andrey Aryamnov, the defending Olympic champion who held all but one of the world and Olympic records, suffered an injury to his thigh during the season and bowed out of defending his title. Defending World and 2011 European Champion Khadzhimurat Akkayev of Russia, a former competitor in the middle-heavyweight class who had won silver and bronze at the 2004 and 2008 Olympics respectively, was on the start list, but dropped out with a sore back. The same fate befell his compatriot Dmitry Klokov, 2008 silver medalist, 2005 World Champion, and 2010 and 2011 runner-up, among other accolades. These withdrawals left Marcin Dołęga of Poland, three times World Champion (2006, 2009, and 2010) as the runaway favorite.
There were more surprises in the snatch competition, when Dołęga failed to lift 190 kg in three attempts and was eliminated. Had he been successful, he would have finished this part of the event in first, as only his compatriot Bartłomiej Bonk, 2011 European bronze medalist, was able to lift that weight and, because he had a higher body weight than Dołęga, would have been ranked lower. The next highest lift was 185 kg and it was achieved by three competitors, including Oleksiy Torokhtiy of Ukraine, 2011 world bronze medalist. In the clean and jerk portion, Bonk failed in his first attempt at 219 kg, but made 220 kg in his second lift and went into first place with a six point lead. Navab Nasirshelal of Iran, bronze medalist at the 2009 Asian Championships, and Torokhtiy then both entered with successful lifts of 222 kg, putting them in third and second place respectively. Bonk, along with three others, then failed to lift 225 kg, setting the bar for gold at 410 points. The Ukrainian attempted a 226 kg lift, which would have put him in the lead with 411 points, but failed, giving Nasirshelal a chance to reach the same mark with a 227 kg lift. The Iranian succeeded and leaped into gold medal position, but Torokhtiy matched the lift and moved into first place with a score of 412.  When Nasirshelal was unable to respond with the necessary 229 kg lift, Torokhtiy took the gold in a score that was notably low for the division; in the three previous editions of the Games, 412 would not have been sufficient for even a bronze medal.
And that was how the results stood until December 2019, when the IOC announced that Oleksiy Torokhtiy was disqualified after a re-test of his samples, when the re-test showed metabolites of dehydrochloromethyltestosterone (Turinabol). In late November 2020, the medals in this event were re-assigned, respectively, to Nassirshalal, Bonk, and Ivan Yefremov (UZB).

Both asserted their dominance throughout the round robin play, drawing criticism for the large margins with which they were winning their games. In its opener against Slovakia, Canada bested the records it had held from a 2006 match against Italy (where it had won 16-0) with a final score of 18-0, setting new bars for greatest point disparity, biggest shutout, and most goals scored in one game. Their 7 goals in the first period also tied their record from the Italy game for most goals scored in one period. Slovakia’s goaltender Zuzana Tomčíková nevertheless had an impressive game by stopping 49 other shots. By the semifinals, questions were being raised in the media as to whether women’s ice hockey was competitive enough to be an Olympic sport.
The bronze medal game was fought between Sweden and Finland, with the latter emerging victorious after an overtime goal by Karoliina Rantamäki set the score at 3-2. The final came, as expected, in the form of a showdown between Canada and the United States. Rookie Marie-Philippe Poulin of Canada scored two goals within 2:55 of each other in the first period, and the score never changed past that point, despite intense play from both sides. With their win, Canada extended their record to three Olympic gold medals in the tournament and 15 consecutive victories in Olympic matches. It was a tournament of records, with Canada scoring a total of 48 points, one more than their previous record of 47 from 2006. Both Canada’s Meghan Agosta and Switzerland’s Stefanie Marty set a new high of 9 goals in an Olympic tournament, with Agosta scoring a record 14 points overall, 6 of which came from the match against Slovakia, an individual game point record. Pernilla Winberg of Sweden set a new bar as well, becoming the first female to score four goals in one Olympic game during a 6-2 victory against Slovakia, a feat that was matched a few days later by Marty in a game against China. Jenny Potter of the United States, meanwhile, became the first player to to score hat tricks in two consecutive matches after making her three goals in 12-1 and 13-0 victories against China and Russia respectively. When the Canadians mounted the top step of the podium, the emotion in Canada was obvious.

In Mexico the two teams met at the semi-final stage with the Soviets winning only by the tiebreaker of hits conceded after both teams had won eight bouts each.
This put the Soviets into the final where they would face France.  World Champion Viktor Putiatin was off form at these Olympic Games and would lose all three of his matches in the final. This gave France the momentum to record a 9-6 victory and regain the title for the first time since Helsinki.
Poland won the bronze medal by defeating Romania.

Deeper placements based on points earned in earlier rounds, and time in final round skated.",na,"One of the major favourites for the relay gold in Hamar was eliminated 11 months before the Games. The sole qualifying event for the Olympics was the relay at the World Championships, with the top eight teams qualifying. A fall of star skater Kim Gi-Hun meant South Korea missed the final eight, while Great Britain (silver medallist at the 1992 World Championships) was also eliminated. 1993 World Champion became New Zealand, which set a new World Record in the process. But all of the other nations also stood a chance of winning a medal, excepting perhaps the home team, Norway.
In the end, it was Italy, the United States, Canada and Australia qualifying for the final. Italy was the fastest team in the heats, and the strongest squad in the final. Their top man was 500 m World Record holder Mirko Vuillermin, who was poised to make up for his narrow defeat in the 500 m. Departing about halfway, the Italians opened up a 1 to 2 second gap that they never gave up. Behind them, the Americans took the silver, with Eric Flaim among them. He had earlier won a silver medal as a long track speed skater (in 1988), and became the first person to win Olympic medals in both sports. The Australian team, in third, won their country’s first ever Olympic medal at the Winter Games.
In 1997, two members of the golden Italian team would be involved in motorcycle accidents. Within a month, first Orazio Fagone suffered the amputation of his right leg, and then Vuillermin was severely injured. Vuillermin recovered, but never returned to the sport, while Fagone is wheelchair-bound, but later picked up ice sledge hockey and competed in that sport in the 2006 Paralympics.

Dransart was also the only World medalist present in Melbourne, having been runner-up in 1950, and had also won a silver medal in the C-2 10000 with his partner Marcel Renaud the previous day. The reigning World Champions, the Austrians, were represented by Otto Schindler and Walter Waldner, while defending Olympic champion Denmark sent Kaj Sylvan and Gerner Christiansen. All this meant that there were no particularly strong favorites in this event.
The opening heats were won by Alexe Dumitru and Simion Ismailciuc of Romania, who were relatively unknown, and Hungary’s Ferenc Mohácsi and Károly Wieland, the latter of whom was one of the reigning World Champions in the C-2 10000. Drews and his partner Herbert Kirschner, meanwhile, were eliminated in the Romanian heat. The final developed into a race to the finish between Dumitru and Ismailciuc and the Soviet duo of Pavel Kharin and Gratsian Botev, which the former won, leaving silver to the latter. The Hungarians, meanwhile, were far enough ahead of the rest of the field (albeit even farther behind the leaders) that they captured bronze with ease. The Danes, however, had worse luck, as Sylvan and Christiansen were disqualified for crossing into another lane. Kharin and Botev’s medal was their second of the tournament, as they had also won the C-2 10000 the day before.

Outside of the South Koreans, all the favorites made the final, which featured Canada, China, the United States and Italy.
The race was somewhat of an anti-climax, though. Except for the Canadians, all the teams saw one of their skaters fall, making it easy for the North Americans to defend their title. The Canadians had a five-second gap over the Italians that placed second, had eight seconds on the Chinese, and even lapped the Americans that finished last in the final. For Canada, it was a successful night of short track, as team members Marc Gagnon and Jonathan Guilmette had placed 1-2 in the 500 m final earlier in the evening.

Zhang and Wang had already won the gold and silver medals from the singles event and Wang, the only Olympic veteran on the team, was back to defend the gold medal earned in Beijing. Seeded second and third were South Korea and Japan, but each team had only one member ranked within the top ten, leading most observers to expect an easy Chinese victory.
As with the women’s event, no team defeated a higher-ranked team in the first round, which left the quarterfinals consisting of the top eight seeded squads. The biggest upset came when sixth-ranked Hong Kong earned a hard-won victory against third-ranked Japan by winning three matches to two. They were then toppled by South Korea in the semi-finals, leaving them to battle for bronze with Germany, who was outmanoeuvered by China. South Korea fought valiantly against the Chinese team in the finals, but the skill of the tournament favorites was unmatchable and the Chinese retained the Olympic title with relative ease. In the bronze medal match, Germany was able to respond to Hong Kong’s challenge with a 3-1 victory, earning them the final podium spot. Thus, although Germany and South Korea changed spots, the same three nations from 2008 remained on top in London and, for the second time in a row and fourth overall, China swept the Olympic table tennis gold medals.

To prevent Kuznetsov from using his wrestling moves, his plan was to take him to the ground. He did that at three minutes, and used yoko-shiho-gatame to win his second gold medal. Ruska retired after the München Olympics. He was striking with his light blonde hair, and very muscular. He followed Anton Geesink in going to Japan to wrestle professionally, where he was quite popular.

A strong distance skater, he had been silver medalist in the 10,000 at Cortina. The world record was held by Boris Shilkov, who was the defending champion, but did not compete at Squaw Valley. At the World Championships, the 5,000 had been won at the recent 1960 meet by Soviet skater Valery Kotov and in 1959 by Dutch skater Jan Pesman, and both appeared for the race. A few days before the event, in a pre-Olympic meet in Squaw Valley, Pesman had won the distance with Johannesen second.
High winds hampered the race. The favorites were drawn late among the 37 starters, the first to go off Johannesen in the ninth pair. The leader at the time was his teammate, Torsten Seierstein, with 8:05.3. Johannesen was behind his pace almost throughout, but caught up on the final laps, and finished much more strongly, crossing in 8:00.8 to take the lead. Pesman was the next favorite up, in the 11th pair, alongside Soviet skater Viktor Kosichkin. Pesman skated well, and would eventually win the bronze medal, with a time of 8:05.1. But he was crushed by Kosichkin, who was not unknown, having placed second at the distance at the 1959 European Championships and third at the recent 1960 Worlds. He started behind Seierstein’s pace until 2,600 metres, but then reeled off metronymic 37-38 second laps to the end, winning easily with 7:51.3, over nine seconds ahead of Johannesen. A few days later, in the 10,000, Johannesen would win with Kosichkin second. Together they would fight several battles in the longer distances over the years, with Kosichkin winning the all-around at the 1961 European and 1962 World Championships.

This left silver medalist Fabian Cancellara of Switzerland, who had also won the individual time trial in Beijing, as a significant favorite going into the event, although many observers also placed their bets on local hero Mark Cavendish, who was to be supported by a British )dream team) that included multiple Olympic gold medalist Bradley Wiggins, who just days before had won the Tour de France. The course’s flat terrain was thought to be the ideal setting for strong sprinters such as Cavendish to capture the podium.
A strong overall British team led the pack for much of the race, but slowly its members began to drop off from the competition. They were further set back when they decided against joining a critical breakaway 40km from the finish, hoping instead to stay with the peloton and have Cavendish sprint to gold in the final stretch of the race. With approximately 15km left to go, Cancellara crashed on a turn, opening up the competition to some of the second favorites such as Germany’s Andre Greipel and Belgium’s Tom Boonen. With approximately 10km to go, however, Columbia’s Rigoberto Urán and Kazakhstan’s Aleksandr Vinokurov broke away from the pack and led it for the remainder of the race. The duo was neck and neck until the end, when Urán slowed to look behind and Vinokurov bolted forwards for an easy victory. When the remainder of the pack caught up, it was Norway’s Alexander Kristoff who claimed the bronze.
Vinokurov was a dark horse for the victory. Although he had been cycling in the Olympics since 1996, and won silver in the individual road race in 2000 (having supposedly given up his shot at a victory to help his former professional teammate Jan Ullrich take gold that year), he was banned from the sport for two years in 2007 after testing positive for blood doping. He announced his retirement later that year, but returned in 2009 and continued to ride until 2011, when a fall during the Tour de France led him to proclaim retirement once more. After better than anticipated results with rehabilitation, however, he returned to cycling for the 2012 season, hoping to make the 2012 Olympic road race his last major competition. His victory, at nearly 39 years old, made him the oldest Olympic road racing champion, besting a record set by Jeannie Longo-Ciprelli of France in 1996. Urán’s medal, meanwhile, was the first for Columbia in the Olympic road race and Kristoff’s was Norway’s first since Dag Otto Lauritzen’s in 1984.

France’s Yannick Agnel, who had dominated the anchor leg of the 4×100 freestyle relay to secure the French gold medal in that event, was also highly considered.

Only the top 60 finishers from the sprint were eligible to start, but in reality, many of the lower finishers would elect not to start this race. For the women, only 52 eventually started in Salt Lake City. The pursuit had been contested at the World Championships since 1997.
Geman Kati Wilhelm had won the sprint and started first, 16 seconds ahead of her teammate Uschi Disl. Disl would fold, done in by seven missed targets, and eventually placed ninth. Olga Pyleva had been only eighth in the sprint, and started 1:03 behind Wilhelm. But she missed only one target in the pursuit section, and with Wilhelm missing four, including three of her first five, Pyleva powered ahead to finish 5.3 seconds ahead of Wilhelm for the gold medal. Bulgarian Irina Nikulchina had been 11th in the sprint, and started 1:16 behind Wilhelm. Nikulchina had only turned to biathlon after competing at the 1994 and 1998 Winter Olympics in cross-country skiing. She used her cross-country strength to gain ground on Wilhelm, and despite missing two shots, won the bronze medal.
Pyleva was not unknown, having won gold medals at the 2000 and 2001 World Championships in the relay. This was her first international gold medal, although she would later win the 15 km individual at the 2004 World Championships. At the 2006 Winter Olympics she initially finished second in the 15 km, but was later disqualified for doping when her urine sample revealed traces of the banned stimulant, carphedon, which is purported to increase endurance and tolerance to cold. Pyleva admitted to taking an over-the-counter medication for an ankle injury, and it was later found that it contained carphedon, which was not listed on the list of ingredients.

The 1,000 was one of the two distances at the World Sprints, held since 1970, and its popularity in that tournament led to its inclusion on the Olympic Program.  The world record holder was Valery Muratov, who skated 1:16.92 at Medeo in 1975. But the favorite was probably his Soviet teammate, Aleksandr Safranov, whose record Muratov had broken. Safronov had won the 1975 World Sprints and won both 1,000s at that meet, and in 1974 was fourth at the World Sprints, also winning one of the 1,000s. In the opening pair, Canada’s Gaétan Boucher posted the inaugural Olympic record for the event, finishing in 1:21.23. The second pair saw unheralded American Peter Mueller well under Boucher’s time, crossing the line in 1:19.32. And that would win the gold medal in a major upset as nobody got close to Mueller’s time. In the fifth pair, Norway’s Jørn Didriksen finished in 1:20.45, over a second behind Mueller, but it would be good for the silver medal. Muratov came up in the eighth pair and was close to Mueller’s time at 600 metres, but faded on the last lap to 1:20.57, which brought him a bronze medal. Skating in the ninth pair, Safranov would not make the podium, finishing fourth. Mueller would win only other one other major race in his career, a 500 at the 1977 World Sprints. His wife was Leah Poulos-Mueller, who won three speed skating silver medals in 1976 and 1980, although they would later divorce. Mueller later had an extensive coaching career, coaching the US team, and later the Dutch and Norwegian national teams.

That distinction went to Iran’s Omid Noroozi, the reigning World Champion, and Azerbaijan’s Həsən Əliyev, the 2010 World Champion, both of whom entered as the favorites in the competition. There were several strong competitors able to challenge for the bronze medals, but most observers foresaw Norouzi and Aliyev battling in the final, as they had ended up in opposite halves of the draw.
Norouzi struggled slightly with China’s Sheng Jiang in the opening round, but moved on and quickly asserted his dominance on his way to the final. Əliyev survived to the semi-finals, defeating Jeong along the way, but was eliminated at this stage by Revaz Lashkhi of Georgia, the 2011 European Champion. In the final, Norouzi was the better wrestler in each round, successfully defending the first par terre and then controlling the second round to score a single point that earned him the gold medal. It was Iran’s second Olympic title in Greco-Roman wrestling, the first having come only one day earlier with Hamid Soryan’s victory in the featherweight division.
In the first bronze medal match Əliyev was unable to defend against an onslaught from Zaur Kuramagomedov of Russia, a 2011 World Championship bronze medalist. Converting two rounds of par terre wrestling into points, Kuramagomedov was able to keep the former World Champion Azerbaijani off the podium. The contest for the second bronze medal was fought between Almat Kebispayev of Kazakhstan, runner-up at the 2011 World Championships and bronze medalist at the 2010 edition, and Ryutaro Matsumoto of Japan, silver medalist at the 2010 World Championships. The two were evenly matched and ferocious, each winning a round, before Matsumoto was able to get the best of his opponent and pin him, winning the bronze medal with the only fall of the event.

Local AAU officials encouraged Lydon to form a soccer league for amateur soccer players only, as most of the local clubs in St. Louis were actually semi-professional soccer teams.  Lydon helped form a Parish League composed of three teams:  Christian Brothers College, St. Rose Parish, and St. Anne’s Parish.  Shortly thereafter, a meeting was held at Christian Brothers College, chaired by Lydon, at which the Amateur Association Football League of St. Louis was established, which was really just an extension of the Parish League, although a fourth team, St. Alphonsus Parish, was added.
On 16 November the Christian Brothers College played the Galt Football Club of Canada and lost decisively, 7-0.  Lydon played halfback for the CBC team.  The Galt (Ontario) team was the Canadian national champions while at that time the CBC team had been in existence for approximately two weeks.  Christian Brothers College at that time was both a college and a high school providing college preparatory courses, although eight of the CBC soccer players were college students.
The next day the Galt team defeated St. Rose 4-0 to win the Olympic soccer championship.  On 18 November CBC and St. Rose played off for second and third place in the Olympic tournament, but neither team could score, despite three overtimes, and after 90 minutes the game was postponed because of darkness.  The playoff match was rescheduled for 23 November and on that day CBC defeated St. Rose 2-0.  Three days prior, however, CBC and St. Rose had actually played to a scoreless tie as part of the regular Parish League schedule.  This scoreless tie was often listed as the first playoff for the Olympic championship, but the local newspapers in that era make it clear that it definitely was not part of the Olympic tournament.
Football (soccer) at the 1904 Olympics has a solid claim to having been an Olympic sport.  Although it had an American and fairly local flavor, it did have international teams and even an international champion. There were also three (3) other Canadian teams entered - the University of Toronto, the Winnipeg Shamrocks, and the Toronto Scots - and the Berlin Rangers and Seaforth Hurons had considered entering. The Berlin Rangers could not afford the $500 the trip would cost. The University of Toronto lost and tied against Galt in the weeks before the Olympic tournament and they decided if they could not beat Galt in two tries in Canada, it was pointless to travel to St. Louis.
It is often written that the Galt players did not receive their medals until they were back in Canada. However, Canadian soccer historian Colin Jose discovered that the medals were actually given to the players in the St. Louis City Clerks’ Office.

Finishing only 11th, she came back on the second run with the third best time but it only moved her up to seventh overall. The first run was led by American Christin Cooper, who was a top international skier, having won silver medals in slalom and GS at the 1982 World Championships, but she was not the best American, that title going to Tamara McKinney, the 1983 overall World Cup winner. McKinney also struggled on the first run, placing eighth, coming back to win the second run, but falling just short of the medals in fourth place. The runner-up on the first run was another American, this one a much bigger surprise, as Debbie Armstrong had only one podium finish in her first year on the World Cup circuit, a third in a super-G a few weeks before the Olympics. On the second run, the happy-go-lucky Armstrong was determined to enjoy herself and simply have fun in what for her was an unknown situation. She placed fourth on the second run, but when Cooper almost missed the fifth gate, costing her time which eventually placed her seventh on the second run, the gold medal was Armstrong’s.
Cooper and Armstrong later repaid the citizens of Sarajevo who had treated them so well. Cooper co-founded Humanitarian Olympians for Peace, which aided the later to be war-torn Bosnian capital with lifts of tons of winter clothing and sports equipment. Armstrong helped found Global ReLeaf Sarajevo, which helps to re-forest the devastated regions around Sarajevo.

Britain’s Lizzie Armitstead, however, the silver medallist in 2012 and reigning world champion, was one of the fancied riders despite some people feeling she should have been banned after missing three OOC doping tests between August 2015 and June 2016. She was cleared to compete in the Olympics, however, by the Court of Arbitration for Sport. Furthermore, Armitstead had 16 ‘clean’ tests in 2016. Other potential medallists were London 2012 bronze medallist Olga Zabelinskaya, and 2015 World Championship silver and bronze medallists Anna van der Breggen, Netherlands, and Megan Guarnier, USA.
There were no changes in the format since London 2012, with the 68 starters setting off in a mass start from Flamengo Park and, after travelling 37.4 km along Avenida Atlântica, completing two laps of the 24.7 km Grumari circuit, which was used for the time trials, before a 26.4 km ride to the Vista Chinesa circuit where they completed a 20.4 km loop followed by the 3.3 km ride back to Flamengo Park - the total distance being 136.9 km.
First to attack at 21 km was the youngest rider in the race, 20-year-old Lotte Kopecky of Belgium, and five kilometres later she had a lead of over two minutes. She kept extending her lead with Romy Kasper of Germany making a move out of the peloton to chase Kopecky, but the German was soon back with the pack. At 48 km it was then up to Ellen van Dijk (Netherlands), Giorgia Bronzini (Italy) and Anna Plichta (Poland) to chase Kopecky, and her lead at 62 km was below a minute for the first time in the last 39 km. Shortly afterwards she was back with the group before Audrey Cordon of France was next to attack at 81 km but her lead did not last long and all the riders were together again at 89 km. Seven riders then made a break and in the group was the defending champion Marianne Vos. That leading pack was soon down to four riders: van der Breggen, Annemiek van Vleuten, Mara Abbott (USA) and Elisa Longo Borghini of Italy, the daughter of the Olympic cross country skier Guidina Dal Sasso. Van Vleuten then made a break with 18 km to go but was joined by Abbott with Emma Johansson joining the chasing pack of three riders some 50 seconds behind. With 15 km to go it started raining and van Vleuten was in the lead on her own but on the fast descent on the Vista Chinesa circuit back to the start, just as in the men’s race the day before, when the outright leaders crashed, van Vleuten had a bad crash. This left Abbott the lone leader 40 seconds ahead of the three chasers van der Breggen, Longo Borghini and Johansson but, agonizingly for the American, she was caught metres from the line with van der Breggen crossing the line first to make it successive women’s Olympic road race titles for the Netherlands, after Marianne Vos in 2012. For Abbott, she missed out on a medal as both Johansson and Longo Borghini overtook her for silver and bronze respectively. For Johansson, it was her second silver to add to the one she won in Beijing. Before turning professional in 2012, the Dutch champion, and 2015 and 2016 Flèche Wallonne winner, van der Breggen trained as a nurse, and completed an internship in Ghana.

The tragic death of Germany’s Toni Pensburger curtailed the 1966 event whilst adverse weather conditions meant that the next year’s championships were never even started.
Eugenio Monti of Italy had defeated his Olympic jinx in the two man event and entered the four man competition as favourite despite it being seven years since his last world title in the event. 
The weather again threatened to ruin proceedings but after two days were abandoned the racing eventually got underway albeit restricted to two runs instead of the scheduled four.  Monti did not disappoint and posted the fastest time of the first run. Behind him were the Austria I quartet piloted by Edwin Thaler and the second Italian crew. The fastest times of the second run was posted by Switzerland I, which moved them into the bronze medal position, and by Thaler’s Austrians but Monti was not to be denied. His lead was cut to less than a tenth of a second but that was sufficient to make sure that he became the first man to win both bobsleigh events at a single Winter Games.
This was the last race of Monti’s illustrious career which had seen him gather nine world titles in addition to his six Olympic medals and a reputation for fair play. He retired from competition to pursue his business interests but stayed in the sport as manager of the Italian team. After suffering from Parkinson’s disease for close on two decades Monti ended his own life in 2003.

In the final round Schauffele posted a 67 to hold on to win, though it was far from comfortable.

Strangely neither had won the 1975 World Sprints, that going to their teammate Aleksandr Safranov, with Kulikov second and Muratov third, but Safranov was better in the 1,000 and would not compete in the 500 in Innsbruck. The first fast time in the event was set by American  Peter Mueller in the second pair, posting 39.57. Kulikov was off in the next pair and his fast start, 100 in 9.86, which was the best time of the race, brought him home in 39.17 to take the lead. Nobody approached that time in the next six pairs, with Muratov going off in the 10th with the United States’ Dan Immerfall. Immerfall was a challenger, having won the 500 at the 1976 World Juniors in January, and winning one of the 500s at the 1973 World Sprints. Muratov started in 9.96, while Immerfall had a slow start with 10.13. And that set the stage for their finish as Muratov came home in 39.25, followed by Immerfall in 39.54. Though they did not catch Kulikov, who won the gold medal, this brought them the silver and bronze medals. This was the highlight of Kulikov’s competitive career, and his performances fell off after 1976, although in 1981 he would set another world record of 36.91 at Medeo, the first skater to better 37 seconds. In March 1976, Immerfall would place second at the 1976 World Sprints, winning both 500s.

The US team included future NBA players Doug Collins, Kevin Joyce, Tom McMillen, Tommy Burleson, Bobby Jones, and Tom Henderson. Thru eight games, the United States extended its unbeaten streak and reached the final game against the Soviet Union. But US coach Hank Iba played somewhat of an old-style slowdown-type offense, emphasizing defense and never really released his horses.
The final between the Soviet Union and the United States produced the greatest controversy in Olympic basketball history. Trailing with less 10 seconds left, Doug Collins stole a pass and headed for an “almost” uncontested lay-up. But he was intentionally fouled by the Soviet player Sako Sak’andelidze, which was necessary to prevent the automatic two points. When Collins sank two free throws with three seconds left, it gave the US a 50-49 lead, its first of the game. The Soviets attempted to inbound the ball. After the inbounds pass, referee Renato Righetto stopped play, as the Soviet coach claimed a time-out had been called. The Soviets were allowed to attempt another inbound play, and the clock was set back to one second. An inbound pass was thrown but time quickly ran out, and the American players began to celebrate wildly.
However, William Jones, the Secretary-General of FIBA then intervened and ordered the shot clock re-set at three seconds and allowed the final inbounds pass to be re-played again.  Ivan Yedeshko threw a perfect pass to Aleksandr Belov who scored a lay-up over Joyce and McMillan. The US protested but to no avail. US dominance in Olympic basketball was officially over. The US players refused to accept the silver medals, leaving the second step of the podium empty, and continue to do so to this day. In fact, one US player, Kenneth Davis, has had it written into his last will and testament that no member of his family is ever to accept a silver medal for basketball from the 1972 Olympics, even after his death.

Since 1970 the US had won every World Championship except in 1982, when New Zealand triumphed, and they had been undefeated in international tournaments since that defeat. At the Olympics, the US had won all three of the previous gold medals. In 1996 and 2004 they had been unchallenged, winning every game, and in 2004, it had reached almost laughable proportions, winning nine games by a total score of 51-1. In 2000, they had struggled somewhat, losing three games in pool play, but had still recovered to win the gold medal.
In 2005, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) began an investigation into the sports on the Olympic Program. Several new sports, including golf, rugby sevens, and karate, were attempting to get onto the Olympic Program and the IOC wanted to keep the program stable in terms of number of sports. If it was going to add any new sports, some older sports would have to be removed from the Olympics. Baseball was felt to be at risk to be removed, because of doping problems in the American professional leagues, because the top American professionals from Major League Baseball did not play in the Olympics, the relatively high cost of constructing a baseball stadium that would not be used in many countries, the relatively few number of nations that competed internationally at a high level, and since – all criteria the IOC considered important. Softball was felt to be safe – the top players all over the world competed, there had been no doping scandals, Olympic softball was the biggest title in the sport, and further, as a female-only sport, it helped maintain gender balance in the program. But when the IOC met to reconsider the Olympic Program, an unusual thing happened. No sports were added to the Olympic Program but two were to be removed – baseball and softball. In the end it was felt that softball was lumped in with baseball, and cast out with that sport because of the problems with baseball. The only problem that softball had was that it was dominated by one nation, and that nation happened to be the United States, which had little support from the IOC at that time. After multiple appeals, it was finally decided in August 2009 at an IOC Executive Board meeting that softball (and baseball) were off the Olympic Program after the 2008 Olympics.
So Beijing was to be the final Olympic softball tournament. And it started out as they all had – with the US team winning easily. In round-robin play, the USA played seven games, and won seven games, and the margin was even more than in Athina – they won by a combined score of 53-1. In the semi-finals the United States defeated Japan, 4-1, after beating them 7-0 in pool play. Japan then advanced to the grand final against the US by defeating Australia, 4-3 in 12 innings. And in the grand final, something unusual happened – Japan won the gold medal by defeating the US 3-1. The Japanese were exultant while the American players looked lost – they had no conception of how to react to losing.

After winning the 30 km race, she took her career total to eight gold, four silver and three bronze medals as she overtook fellow Norwegians Ole Einar Bjørndalen (8/4/1 in biathlon) and Bjørn Dæhlie (8/4/0 in cross country skiing), as the leading medalist.
Like Finland’s Iivo Niskanen, in the men’s 50 km race the day before, Bjørgen won the women’s longest cross-country race after a long solo run. After just 10 km, she broke away from the lead group that included some of the top skiers: Sweden’s gold medalists Charlotte Kalla (skiathlon) und Stina Nilsson (sprint), two times bronze medalist Krista Pärmäkoski, Kerttu Niskanen, the sister of the men’s 50 km winner, and relay gold medalist Ingvild Flugstad Østberg from Norway. The least expected runner in the top group was Austrian Teresa Stadlober, who was to become a tragic figure in a later phase.
When she changed her skies at the half way mark, Bjørgen was already 51 seconds ahead of the chasing group, and she kept increasing the pace, leading by 1:20 from Stadlober (second) and Pärmäkoski (third) with 10 km to go. Kalla was the first to drop out of the race for a medal, when she changed her skies, unlike the rest of the group, and never managed to close the gap again. As in the men’s event, the tactics of changing skies again proved to be a decisive factor.
With Bjørgen constantly increasing the lead, Stadlober caused the next excitement. When she tried to break away from Pärmäkoski, she made an unbelievable mistake, and took the wrong track. The detour cost her over one minute, and from a sure medal position, she dropped to eighth place. Now Pärmäkoski was Bjørgen’s main chaser and almost in reach of the silver medal. But behind her, Østberg, Nilsson and Niskanen, the sister of the 50 km winner, had not yet given up the fight to win more than bronze. They were in sight of Pärmäkoski, but the Finn held on to a lead of just 10 seconds to secure silver, with Nilsson narrowly defeating Østberg by just 1.5 seconds for third place. Niskanen, who was among the top five throughout the race, lost contact with Nilsson and Østberg when she changed her skies at 22.5 km, and was eventually overtaken by Kalla who finished fifth.
Like Sochi in 2014, and the last World Championships, gold went to Marit Bjørgen. She had a two-minute lead at the final intermediate time, which was reduced to 1:49.5 at the finishing line, as she celebrated victory on the home stretch, waving the flag of her home country. The Norwegian was the fastest skier in 15 out of 24 sectors, Nilsson was faster only in the last two sectors while fighting for bronze, and Pärmäkoski failed to clock the best time in any sector.

The competitors skied 15 km using the classical technique, followed by a pit stop to change to shorter skis, and then skied 15 km freestyle. The 2009 World Champion was Petter Northug of Norway, who was leading the World Cup in 2009-10 and would star in Vancouver with four medals and two golds, but he had wax problems in this race, would break a pole, and finished only 11th. The leader at the pit stop was Lukáš Bauer of the Czech Republic, somewhat of a classical specialist, with Switzerland’s Dario Cologna, already the winner of the 15 km in Vancouver, in second, and Sweden’s Johan Olsson in third. In the freestyle, Olsson quickly moved into the lead, but he was gradually caught and passed on the final hill by his teammate Marcus Hellner, and then by Tobias Angerer (GER) on the run in to the home straight. Hellner held a comfortable lead as he entered the finishing straight and finished in a time of 1-15:11.4 to win the gold medal, 2.1 seconds ahead of Angerer. Olsson held on to take the bronze medal, defeating a fast finishing Aleksandr Legkov (RUS) by 1.2 seconds.

This provided the opportunity for the American team to break the world record which had stood since 1924. Bolstered by the introduction of Eleanor Garatti and Martha Norelius to the team for the final, the USA swam off into the distance and took another large chunk off the world record. The British held off the Dutch for silver with South Africa touching ahead of Germany. The Netherlands were later disqualified for a faulty changeover and South Africa promoted to bronze.

Jorgensen also came into the Games as the 2014 and 2015 World Triathlon Series champion and between April 2014 and April 2016 had enjoyed a run of 17 consecutive wins and was a clear favorite to lift gold in Rio.
However, the reigning European Games champion, Switzerland’s Nicola Spirig Hug was out to thwart the American pair and retain the Olympic title she won at London 2012. The other two London medalists, Lisa Nordén, Sweden (silver) and Erin Densham, Australia (bronze) were also in the Rio field and were medal contenders.
South Africa’s Mari Rabie held a slender one second lead after the opening swim, and after the transition following the cycle ride, she had increased it to two seconds but with Nicola Spirig and Gwen Jorgensen within four seconds of her, she knew that lead would soon disappear once they hit the road, and it did.  After being virtually neck-and-neck with Jorgensen throughout the competition, Spirig knew that her rivals strongest discipline was the run and that is where the title was eventually decided when the American pulled away on the fourth and final lap of the 10km run to win by a massive 40 seconds, the second biggest winning margin after Emma Snowsill’s win by just over one minute at Beijing in 2008.
In the sprint to the finish for the bronze medal, Vicky Holland won a first medal for Great Britain’s women, edging out her friend, training partner, team-mate and flat mate Non Stanford. The first thing Holland said to Stanford as they crossed the line was: “I’m so sorry.” Competing in her fourth Olympics, Spirig had the honour of being the first multiple Olympic female triathlete, adding her Rio silver to London gold, and Vicky Holland’s bronze meant Britain had won three of the six medals on offer in Rio, the first time any one nation had won so many triathlon medals at one celebration.

Bryan Clay was the defending champion, but he had been surpassed in 2010-11 by Ashton Eaton and Trey Hardee. They had gone 1-2 at the 2011 World Championships, with Hardee winning, Eaton second. Unfortunately, Clay was struggling in 2012 with injuries and would not finish the Olympic Trials, and the US had only two entrants in London. At the Trials Eaton won, breaking the world record with a mark of 9,039 points.
In the London event, Eaton and Hardee went into the lead early, with Eaton posting the fastest 100 metres, and Hardee second. They remained 1-2 after the long jump, Eaton again winning that event with a mark that would have placed him seventh in the open long jump. Hardee, bigger and stronger than Eaton, moved up after the shot put, but still trailed Eaton by over 100 points. After the first day, Eaton had a 220 point lead on Hardee, who was 55 points ahead of Canada’s Damian Warner. In sixth place was Cuba’s Leonel Suárez, who was considered a medal favorite and was strong on the second day.
Hardee opened the second day by posting 13.54 in the high hurdles, the second fastest ever in a decathlon, although barely ahead of Eaton’s 13.56. When the two made heights in the pole vault, with Hardee still second, but over 200 points ahead of Germany’s Rico Freimuth, the gold and silver medals were decided. Hardee had some concern in the javelin as he had had surgery in the past year on his throwing arm, but got the spear out to 66.65 and actually moved up closer to Eaton, but far from gold medal pace. Suárez rocketed the jav out to 76.94 and moved into third place. In the 1500 Eaton and Hardee ran safe paces, finishing with gold and silver, as Suárez hung on for the bronze medal.

They claimed that the French officials told them that if a field event ended on Sunday any competitors not wishing to compete would have a chance to post their marks the following day. This was apparently ruled at a meeting on Wednesday, 11 July. On Saturday night, however, the French ruled that the results of all Sunday events would be final, with no recourse to any athletes who did not compete due to Sabbatarian objections. Apparently the Americans were not told of this decision.
The top American vaulters were Charles Dvorak, Daniel Horton, and Bascom Johnson. They were not at the field on Sunday when the pole vault started. Fortunately for the American team, Irv Baxter, who had just won the high jump (which started at 1545), and Meredith Colket, were present and were able to compete in the vault. They took the first two places without much difficulty, but the American team was not happy.
Therefore on Monday morning, 16 July, the French officials held a special pole vault competition – this event – which they considered outside of the Olympic events, and which was won by Bascom Johnson, clearing 3.38 metres. The Americans continued to protest, however, and after the handicap pole vault was held on 19 July, won by Hungarian Jakab Kauser, the organizers conducted another special pole vault competition, won by Daniel Horton (3.45 m) with Charles Dvorak (3.35 m) second, but the original pole vault competition continues to be considered as the Olympic event.

His most notable challengers would be Spain’s David Cal, the 2004 Olympic champion and runner-up in Beijing and the most recent World Championships, and Uzbek Vadim Menkov, the 2009 and 2010 World Champion. Also a factor was Sebastian Brendel of Germany, winner of the last two European Championships in the event.
In the heats Vajda had only the fifth-fastest time, outpaced by Cal, Mark Oldershaw of Canada, Brendel, Mathieu Goubel of France, and José Cristóbal of Mexico, the 2006 World Champion. Vajda fared better in the semi-finals, but still behind Goubel, Brendel, and Oldershaw. With Cal and Menkov surviving to the finals as well, it was certain that the race for the medals would be an exciting and unpredictable one. In the final, Goubel and Brendel took an early lead, going neck and neck for the first quarter of the race and leading the rest of the pack. At the halfway mark Menkov had crossed the gap and was closing in on Brendel as Goubel began fade. By 750 metres Menkov was in front and it seemed as if the podium spots would be decided by the finishing order of these three competitors. At least three canoeists, however, unleashed fantastic sprints in the final end to clinch their medals. Brendel powered past a tiring Menkov, catapulting ahead of his competitors and earning the gold medal. Oldershaw meanwhile, looked poised to take silver as he powered through to the finish in a sprint but Cal, coming from behind with an incredible charge, not only overtook Menkov and Goubel, but passed Oldershaw as well to finish runner-up.
For Cal it was a fifth Olympic medal – in addition to his two in the C-1 1000, he also had silver in the C-1 1500 from 2004 and 2008 – which earned him the title of Spain’s most medalled Olympian. Oldershaw, meanwhile, was the fifth member of his family to compete at the Olympic Games, following his grandfather Bert, father Scott, and uncles Dean and Reed. In this, his second Olympics, after having been eliminated in the semi-finals of the C-1 500 at the 2008 Games, he became the first member of his family to win an Olympic medal. Defending Olympic champion Vajda, meanwhile, placed only sixth among the eight canoeists in the final.

The world record was 15.2, co-held by America’s Johnny Garrells and Art Shaw.  The Americans were the top hurdlers in the world, and it is instructive to look at the winners of their recent major meets.  Forrest Smithson had won the 1907 AAU title, while in 1908, Art Shaw won that event.  At the 1908 American Olympic Trial Meets, four different hurdlers won: Smithson (Western), Garrells (Central), Shaw (IC4A), and Leonard Howe of Yale (Eastern).  Garrells had also won the IC4A crown in 1907.
This race was not run on the cinder track but on a grass track in the infield of the White City Stadium.  Fourteen heats resulted in the elimination of only 11 competitors.  In the second round, Forrest Smithson equalled the Olympic record and then set a world record of 15.0 in the final.  The four American finalists were undoubtedly the best in the field but, surprisingly, they had never raced against each other before.
A well-known photograph suggests that Smithson won the final carrying a Bible in his left hand, and this false rumor has been oft repeated.  But this was, in fact, a posed photograph taken to support Smithson’s protest against Sunday competition.  Precisely to whom this protest was directed is not clear.  The Olympic final was held on a Saturday, and Sunday competition was virtually unknown in England at the time.  Smithson was a devoutly religious man and, after winning the 1909 AAU hurdles title, he became a minister.

Finally, the United States, represented in Melbourne by Detroit Boat Club members Pat Costello and Jim Gardiner, could never be ignored in the double sculls.
The Soviet Union dominated the opening round, while the United States won its heat handily. Australia and the German duo of Thomas Schneider and Kurt Hipper, who had been runners-up at the most recent European Championships, came out on top in the repêchage and joined the two world superpowers in the final. There, the Germans took an early lead, but were quickly passed by the Americans, who were in turn overtaken by the Soviet Union before the halfway mark. The duo from the USSR never relinquished from that point on and captured gold over eight seconds ahead of the United States, who settled for silver. The Australians, meanwhile, gradually overtook the tiring Germans and secured a bronze medal. Riley and Wood were both police officers at the time, but their futures would take decidedly different paths: Wood went on to become the New South Wales Police Commissioner, but eventually had to step down due to his association with Riley, who served many years in jail for major drug-related offenses.

Poland won its heat in the opening round, but Hungary came in third to Alexander Schuck and Thomas Zereske of East Germany and the Soviet Union’s Victor Reneischi and Nicolae Juravschi. Bulgaria’s Deyan Bonev and Petar Bozhilov took a third heat. East Germany won its heat again in the semi-finals, but Poland was defeated by the Soviet Union and Bulgaria came in third to Hungary and Philippe Renaud and Joël Bettin of France. The Soviet Union won the gold medal in the final in Olympic record time and became double Olympic champions the next day when they won the C-2 1000. The race for silver came down to a battle between France and Poland, with the latter emerging victorious by a margin of only 0.2 seconds.

The last three World Champions had been Mikko Kolehmainen of Finland, who was also the defending Olympic champion, Sergey Kalesnik of Belarus, who was also the 1995 runner-up, and Poland’s Piotr Markiewicz. Norway’s Knut Holmann, meanwhile, was the most recent Olympic bronze medalist. It was Italy’s Antonio Rossi, however, who posted the fastest time in the opening round, leaving Kolehmainen in third behind German Lutz Liwowski. Markiewicz and Kalesnik, meanwhile, were third behind Geza Magyar of Romania, while Holmann took the third heat. In the first semi-final heat, Rossi not only defeated Holmann, Kolehmainen, Markiewicz, but helped eliminate Kalesnik and did so in Olympic record time. Liwowski and Magyar, meanwhile, were the first two finishers in the other heat. Rossi then took charge of the final, winning in Olympic record time and almost a second ahead of everyone else, while the race for the final podium spots came down to a battle between Holmann, Markiewicz, Magyar, and Liwowski, who finished in that order within 0.97 seconds of each other. Rossi thus became a double Olympic champion, having won the K-2 1000 the previous day, while Holmann added silver to the gold medal he had won in the K-1 1000.
