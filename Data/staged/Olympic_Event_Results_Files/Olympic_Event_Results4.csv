Ranking rounds scores based on scores carried over from individual ranking round.  Matches consisted of 27 arrows, 9 by each archer.  Tie-breaking for the final placements was done by the following method.  Losers in each round were ranked according to the score they shot in that round.  Ties in that round were broken by the number of 10s shot in that round and then the number of 9s shot in that round.  If still tied the score in the preceding round was used as the tie-breaker, followed by number of 10s, and then number of 9s in the preceding round.  Team event shot entirely at 70 metres. ",na,"By 2004, Korea was easily the world’s dominant archery nation, slightly more so for the women, but the men were also formidable. Beginning in 1995 and going through 2011, Korean men won seven of eight team world titles, missing only in 1999. With that background, the defending champions were heavily favored. Korea led the ranking round and received a bye. They went on to win their gold medal with one very close match, that in the quarter-finals when they narrowly defeated the Netherlands 250-249. The bronze medal came down to the United States against Ukraine, with Ukraine winning an upset victory, 237-236.

Russian Sergey Kamenskiy won the qualification round with 1,184 points, only two points behind the world record and was in the lead in the final going into his final shot, but could only produce a 8.3 hit and was overtaken by Italy’s Niccolo Campriani, the defending champion who had won gold in the air rifle event six days earlier. Campriani became the only shooter with two gold medals in the Rio Games. The young Frenchman Alexis Raynaud secured the bronze medal, just five days before his 22nd birthday.

Four different racers had won the World Cups earlier in the season: No Jin-Kyu, Charles Hamelin, Lee Han-Bin and J. R. Celski. No, also World Champion in 2011 and 2012, was missing in Sochi due to a broken elbow, but the other three all were there. The 2006 Olympic Champion, An Hyeon-Su, was also considered for a medal, although the former Korean now skated for Russia as Viktor An.
All the favored athletes reached the final, although in Lee’s case it was as a result of being impeded in the semi-final. There was drama in the final when Briton Jack Whelbourne, a surprise finalist, hit one of the rubber blocks and twisted his ankle. As the race progressed Hamelin always stayed near the front and came through to take the gold medal, with Han Tianyu just edging out An for the silver medal. Lee was Korea’s best performer, by their standards a disappointing result in finishing sixth. An won Russia their first ever short-track medal

Accumulation of 5 negative points eliminated the wrestler.",na,"There were only eight entrants. The first round saw Greek Georgios Zervinis pin Canadian Jim Trifunov in only 41 seconds, but neither would factor in the medals. After three rounds, the medalists were decided, with Bob Pearce (USA), Ödön Zombori (HUN) and Aatos Jaskari (FIN) advancing to the medal round. Zombori was leading at that time with only 1 bad point, but Pearce and Jaskari both defeated him by decision to eliminate him. This gave the gold medal to Pearce as he had defeated Jaskari in the first round, and it also gave Jaskari 5 bad points.
Zombori would return to win the gold medal in Berlin and enjoyed a very long career. He was European Champion in freestyle in 1931 and 1933 and in Greco-Roman in 1933, and he actually competed at the World Championships in 1958, after a long absence. Pearce was a top American wrestler, but this was his only international competition.

The qualifying teams were selected as follows: host nation (China), World Cup (Italy, Brazil, United States), Continental qualifiers (Algeria, Kazakhstan, Russia, Cuba, Venezuela), and qualifying tournaments (Poland, Serbia, Japan).
Brazil’s women’s team had won seven FIVB World Grand Prix’s since 1993 and was ranked number one coming in to Beijing. But the Brazilians had never won a gold medal in women’s volleyball. At the 2006 World Championships, they had been runners-up behind Russia. The semi-finals saw Brazil playing the hometown Chinese, the defending gold medalists, and the United States playing the formerly dominant Cuban team. But neither team was a match for Brazil and the United States as both won easily in three sets. The United States had not won a major international event in women’s indoor volleyball, but in Beijing, US teams won the men’s indoor volleyball gold, and both beach volleyball gold medals. But Brazil was too strong, and the US could not sweep the volleyball gold medals, losing in four sets, 25-15, 18-25, 25-13, 25-21.

Anticipation was high because Rosi Mittermaier had already won gold medals in the downhill and slalom, and was attempting to match the Alpine triple golds of Toni Sailer and Jean-Claude Killy. The first starter was Canadian Kathy Kreiner, who had won one World Cup race, a giant slalom in 1974. Mittermaier was the fourth starter and led Kreiner thru all the early checkpoints, until a poor line on a gate near the end caused her to lose time and the gold medal to Kreiner. Mittermaier hung on for the silver, with the bronze going to France’s Danièle Debernard.

The defending Olympic champions from Italy, Giuseppe Moioli, Elio Morille, Giovanni Invernizzi, and Francesco Faggi, returned and looked somewhat strong, having won the 1947, 1949, and 1950 European Championships. In 1951, however, they had not factored into the podium, being replaced at the top by Belgium’s Charles Van Antwerpen, Jos Rosa, Harry Elzendoorn, and Florent Caers. The 1951 and 1952 Stewards’ Challenge Cup at the Henley Royal Regatta, which was considered the equivalent of a World Championship at the time, had been won by the Thames Rowing Club, but Britain’s quartet was a hodgepodge of rowers that included Harry Almond, John Jones, James Crowden, and Adrian Cadbury. Denmark factored into all of these events, having been the runner-up at the last three European Championships and, with the Hellerup Roklubb, winner of the 1952 Stewards’ Challenge Cup. Three among their entry, Carl Nielsen, Harry Nielsen, and Paul Locht had taken part in the 1951 Europeans, and they were augmented by Knud Bruun Jensen.
Among these nations, however, only Great Britain would factor into the final. Denmark was eliminated after the round one repêchage, while Belgium and Italy fell in the semi-finals. The opening heats were dominated by the French and Yugoslavian quartets, who both won the semi-finals convincingly, if not as thoroughly: Norway came second in France’s heat with a time 0.1 seconds faster than Yugoslavia’s, although Great Britain eliminated them in the semi-final repêchage. It was Yugoslavia, however, who reigned supreme in the final: its quartet of Duje Bonačić, Velimir Valenta, Mate Trojanović, and Petar Šegvić took gold ahead of France’s Pierre Blondiaux, Jean-Jacques Guissart, Marc Bouissou, and Roger Gautier. It was the former nation’s first Olympic medal in rowing and its only gold. Finland’s crew, consisting of Kauko Wahlsten, Lauri Nevalainen , and cousins Veikko and Oiva Lommi, edged out the British squad to win their nation’s first Olympic rowing medal as well, while Poland rounded out the final with a fifth-place finish.

This was another relatively open event although Romanian Gina Gogean had won a medal at the last three World Championships and at two of the last three Europeans. She made the final but would finish only seventh. The leading qualifier was American Kerri Strug, but the ankle injury she sustained on vault in her last rotation of the team event caused her to withdraw. Gold eventually went to the all-around champion, Ukrainian Liliya Podkopaieva, who was followed by Romanian Simona Amânar. Bronze was won by American Dominique Dawes, who just edged out her teammate and namesake, Dominique Moceanu.

Quarrie had won the 100/200 double at the 1970 and 1974 Commonwealth Games, and would win the 100 again in 1978. He was considered better at the 200, but was a top century sprinter as well. Williams spent 1973-76 amassing a series of superb times, equaling the world records in both 100 yards and 100 metres. Many experts consider him, at his best, the fastest man of the 70s, but injuries and boycotts prevented him from ever making an Olympic team.Both Williams and another top rated American Houston McTear missed the Games after suffering hamstring injuries at the US Trials. Another possible medal contender Silvio Leonard of Cuba failed to reach the final after reportedly being injured in a pillow fight shortly after arriving in Montreal.
Valery Borzov was back in 1976, but was not the dominant sprinter he had been in 1972 and was carrying a minor leg injury. Another finalist from 1972 who was back was Trinidad’s Hasely Crawford, who first was noticed placing third behind Quarrie at the 1970 Commonwealth Games in the 100 but who Track and Field News described as “a man of frequent high expectations who hasn’t yet fulfilled that promise”.  In the Olympic final, Borzov and American Harvey Glance took the early lead, but Quarrie caught them by 20 metres. Crawford finished quickly to nip Quarrie at the line – by 1/100th of a second. Borzov added a bronze to his 1972 gold and Glance placed fourth.

The unified team sent Günter Bergau, Peter Gorny, and Karl-Heinz Danielowski, the reigning European Champions, to Tokyo. The coxed pairs was, however, a traditionally open event, and the United States, victors at the 1963 Pan American Games, sent a strong team consisting of Conn Findlay, a 1956 Olympic champion and 1960 bronze medalist, his long-time partner Ed Ferry, and another 1960 bronze medalist, Kent Mitchell.
The opening heats were won by the United States, France, and Poland, although the Dutch and the Soviets also had strong performances. The Soviets had entered the squad that had been runners-up at the most recent European Championships, Nikolay Safronov, Leonid Rakovshchik, and 1960 Olympic silver medalist Igor Rudakov, while Poland’s Kazimierz Naskręcki, Marian Siejkowski , and Stanisław Kozera had been the bronze medalists at that event.  Both the USSR and the Netherlands advanced to the final through the repêchage, along with Czechoslovakia, with the Soviets doing so by outperforming the German trio. Surprisingly devoid of a serious challenge, the Americans won the final comfortably, while France and the Netherlands went neck and neck for silver; the former emerged on top by less than 0.3 seconds. The Dutch therefore took one of their first rowing medals of any color since 1924 (in addition to silver in the coxless pairs and bronze in the coxed fours). Argentina, although eliminated in the repêchage, managed to earn one historic distinction in this event: a member of its crew, Oscar Rompani, was competing at the age of 60, making him the oldest rower to take part in the Olympics.

Switzerland, who had won the event in 1920 and every European Championship since 1911 (except 1922), and France (the 1922 European champions) were the traditionally strong countries in this discipline; the former brought back one of the gold medalists from the previous edition of the Games, Hans Walter, to compete in Paris. In the opening round, however, it was the Netherlands who had the fastest time, winning their heat ahead of the Swiss, who had the third-fastest result overall, behind France. The other heat winners were Italy and the United States. Switzerland won the repêchage and earned a spot in the final, which was led by the Dutch team until midway through the course, at which point the exhausted nation dropped from the race. The Swiss crew then took the lead and beat out France for the gold medal, with the United States coming in third.

Canada and the Soviet Union played a summit series of eight games, four in Canada, and four in Moscow.  After five games, the Canadian NHL stars were trailing, with only one win and one tie.  To pull out the series they had to win the final three games in the Soviet’s rink.  All Canadians from that era know where they were on September 28, 1972, when Paul Henderson scored the final goal of the eighth game, to allow Canada to defeat the USSR in the game, and the series.
But the IOC still did not allow professionals to compete and Canada again eschewed sending a team to the Innsbruck Winter Olympics.  Led by forwards Valery Kharlamov and Aleksandr Yakushev, goalie Vladislav Tretyak, and the huge defenseman, Boris Mikhaylov, the Soviets again won the gold medal, defeating Czechoslovakia, 4-3, in the final game.

The finishing order of the final was Kiyokawa-Irie-Kawatsu, the first time Japan had made a clean sweep of the medals in any Olympic event. The main rival to the Japanese trio should have been Germany’s Ernst Küppers but he committed a false start and seemingly unnerved by this, he finished in fifth. Masaji Kiyokawa spent twenty years as a member of the IOC and served as a vice-president of the organization.

At the European Championships in January 2000, held in Croatia, they lost a dramatic play-off for 5th place and an Olympic ticket to their neighbours Slovenia, 25-24.
All seven European nations qualified for the quarter-finals, where they were joined by Egypt. The finalists of the 1999 Worlds, Russia and Sweden progressed with relative ease in both quarter-finals and semi-finals. In the final, the Swedes went into the break with a 14-13 lead. In the second half, the Russians rallied from 16-14 behind to 21-16 ahead, with thanks to various saves from goalie Andrey Lavrov. The Swedes managed to slightly close the gap, but never again levelled with the Russians, eventually losing 28-26. It was a disappointing loss for the Swedes, as it marked their third consecutive silver medal. The Russians won their first medal as an independent nation, but goalkeeper Lavrov became the first handball player to win three Olympic gold medals, having earlier played for the Soviet Union (1988) and the Unified Team (1992).

Ballet would later be termed Acroski as an event, but it was discontinued at the World Championships after 1999, as it lost popularity after it was never afforded Olympic status with the other freestyle events.
The favorite was American Lane Spina, the 1991 World Champion, runner-up at the Worlds in 1986 and 1989, and runner-up at the 1988 Calgary demonstration event. However, the title went to France’s Fabrice Becker, who would go on to win the Worlds in 1993 and 1997.

Six first round heats followed by six repêchages qualified 12 riders for the quarter-finals. From the quarter-finals onward, all matches were best two of three races. The semi-finals came down to Rousseau, Italian Guglielmo Pesenti, and two riders from Oceania. In the first heat, Rousseau defeated New Zealander Warren Johnston easily in two straight races. The second heat had Pesenti and Dick Ploog (AUS). They split the first two races, and in the decider, Ploog took the lead on the last back straight as they started the sprint. He swept down inside Pesenti who passed him quickly, and Ploog stood up. But he did not raise his hand for a protest, and did not actually finish the course on the track. However, the Australian team manager protested that Pesenti had cut Ploog off when he passed him. Later that evening, the commissaries ruled in Pesenti’s favor, but Australia appealed again and it was not until the next morning that the final ruling came back that there had been no foul.  In the final, Rousseau won comfortably in two straight races, with 11.4 his 200 metre time for each race, equaling the Olympic record both times. Rousseau was again amateur sprint World Champion in 1957 and then turned professional.

The Uruguayans encountered their main obstacle in the semi-finals, trailing the Dutch team by 0-1 at half-time. The Uruguayans fought their way back, but only decided the match with a penalty kick that most observers thought to have been an error by the French referee.
While Uruguay won an easy victory over Switzerland in the final, the match for bronze was more closely fought. In the first match, Sweden and the Netherlands tied one all after extra time, and a second match had to be played. The replay was held less than 24 hours after the first game, and both teams played with heavily changed line-ups due to fatigued players. Sweden won the match 3-1.

She was the 1997 World Champion and won the European title in 1998 and earlier in 2000. Khorkina led the qualifying comfortably over Romanians Andreea Răducan and Simona Amânar. She then opened with a floor ex score of 9.812 and seemed on her way. However, in the vault, she missed both vaults badly, scoring only 9.343. Shaken, she moved on to her next apparatus, the uneven bars, and things got worse, as she fell off the bars and posted only a 9.012. Then things got tricky.
Several gymnasts had fallen on the vault, and Australian Allana Slater thought something looked odd about the apparatus. She thought it was too low, and when it was re-checked it was, indeed, 5 cm lower than standard. It turned out that when it was re-set after the men’s vault, the height had not been changed to the women’s height. The 18 gymnasts who had already vaulted were given the chance to perform the apparatus again, but for Khorkina, it was no help as her subsequent fall on the uneven bars gave her no shot at a medal.
Romanian Maria Olaru had predicted that she and her Romanian teammates would sweep the medals in this event and that was what appeared to happen. Răducan was placed first initially, with 38.893, with Amânar second with 38.642, and Olaru third with 38.581, as Khorkina would finish only 10th. Then four days later Răducan’s doping test came back positive for pseudoephedrine, a common ingredient found in cold medicines. The Romanian doctor Ioachim Oanâ had given Răducan the cold medicine a few days before the competition, which caused the positive test. Răducan was disqualified from the all-around but she would be allowed to keep her other Sydney medals. Oanâ was banned from the sport for four years. China’s Liu Xuan, who had only been 20th in qualifying, was moved up to receive the bronze medal.

He had won the 2006 World Championships and was favored to win his second consecutive gold in Beijing. In the semi-finals he faced David Musuľbes, who had won the 2000 gold medal representing Russia. Musuľbes had not been chosen for the 2004 Olympic team so left the Russian squad and began competing for Slovakia, as he did in Beijing. The match between the last two gold medalists was very close, but Taymazov prevailed, winning the first two periods 1-0. In the final Taymazov faced Russian Bakhtiyar Akhmedov, also shutting him in and winning in two straight periods. Taymazov would return in 2012 and win his third consecutive gold medal in this class. Musuľbes held on and won a bronze medal in Beijing, along with Kazakh Marid Mutalimov.
That was how the event and the results seemed to have ended. In 2015, however, the IOC began re-testing samples from the 2008 Beijing and 2012 London Olympics, using newer, more advanced testing techniques, in an effort to find those who had used performance enhancing drugs (PEDs), but in whom it could not be detected at the time of those Olympics. This was one of the many events affected.
In April 2017, Artur Taymazov (UZB) was revealed to have a positive test for turinabol (dehydrochloromethyltestosterone) and stanozolol, and was disqualified, tentatively losing his gold medal. However, he appealed the suspension to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS), but that appeal was rejected in March 2018, with the updated results as shown.

Armin Zöggeler, 36-year-old Olympic champion at both Salt Lake City and Torino and perenniel contender Albert Demchenko of Russia. Behind them came a plethora of German talent including reigning world champion Felix Loch and former champion David Möller.
Following the tragic death of Nodar Kumaritashvili in practice, the men’s course was shortened to start where the women normally started. Whilst the 178 metres may not sound a great distance, it changed the nature of the competition as it favoured the competitors with a powerful start over those who relied more on the technical skills of driving round a course to gain time. Felix Loch (GER), the world champion from 2008 and 2009, led from the start, and with the leading time from each of the four runs ended with a combined time of 3:13.085. He was followed closely by David Möller (GER), who had the second fastest time in each run, to finish 0.679 seconds behind Loch. Reigning champion from 2002 and 2006, Armin Zöggeler (ITA), who favoured the longer, more technical courses, had the third fastest run on his first two runs. Although his third and fourth runs saw him being the 6th and 4th fastest of the competitors respectively, his combined time of 3:14.375 was enough to give him the bronze medal. This was Zöggeler’s fifth successive Olympic medal, which tied the record of Georg Hackl, and brought his career to an end with a final total of five Olympic (2 gold), 14 World Championship (5 gold), 11 European Championships (3 gold) medals added to nine victories in the season long Word Cup series.
Loch, the son of the president of Germany’s national Luge Federation, had a strange relationship with the Whistler track. His first visit in 2008 had left him in hospital with an injured shoulder but on returning in 2009 a speed trap recorded him at 153.98 km/h (95.68 mph), the fastest speed ever recorded in the sport. At 20-years-old he added the distinction of being the sport’s youngest ever Olympic champion to that of being the youngest ever World Champion.
In last place (38th), was the 47-year-old Argentine Rubén González. This was González’s 4th Winter Games with each appearance coming in a different decade.
Most importantly, in view of the disastrous start to the Olympic programme, was that all those who started came safely home.

Badea ousted Trillini in a classic semi-final where the Italian fought back from a seemingly impossible position to draw level at 14-14 before the Romania forced the decisive hit. Badea’s win over Vezzali was much more straightforward. This was Romania’s first gold in fencing since 1968.

He led two International Himalaya Expeditions, one in 1930 and one in 1934. The aim of the first was to climb Kangchenjunga – the third highest mountain in the world. Although that objective was not met, several geological and medical experiments had been useful, and the expedition was widely publicized. Additionally, members of the expedition reached the top of the Jongsong, which at 7,462 m was the highest peak to have been climbed at the time.
An important member of the expedition had been Oskar’s wife, Hettie Dyhrenfurth (née Heymann). With the rise of the Nazi party in the early 1930s, the Jewish couple decided to apply for Swiss citizenship. Their 1934 expedition led them to the Gasherbrum ()Hidden Peak)), reaching 6,900 m, and the Sia Kangri. At the latter mountain, Hettie reached 7,442 m, setting a new world altitude record for women which she only lost to Claude Kogan in 1954.
The Dyhrenfurths were unanimously awarded the gold medal for alpinism, citing their expeditions to the Himalaya, although technically only the 1934 expedition was eligible. This decision was remarkable as the Germans probably didn’t like their former citizens winning this award. As a result, the prize was barely mentioned in any German or even Swiss publications, much to the chagrin of Oskar Dyhrenfurth.

Between them they had won the distance at most of the recent international tournaments, including the 1966 and 1967 World and European Championships. But the 1968 Europeans had been held shortly before the Winter Olympics and that distance was won by Soviet skater Eduard Matusevich. Another contender was the world record holder, Magne Thomassen of Norway, who had recorded 2:02.5 in Davos only 11 days previously.
Schenk and Matusevich were the first favorites off, together in the second pair, and Schenk posted 2:05.0 for the others to shoot at, while Matusevich trailed in 2:06.1, and would eventually place eighth. Verkerk was in the sixth pair and he was right on pace through 700 metres, and slightly ahead at 1,100. He finished in 2:03.4, which would easily win him the gold medal. Five pairs later, Norway’s Ivar Eriksen came through to tie Schenk in 2:05.0. He was followed by Thomassen, who skated in the 12th pair, and finished in 2:05.1, just outside the medals.
Verkerk had been around since 1963 at an international level and his career would last until 1974, during which he would win the 1966 and 1967 World Championships and the 1967 European Championship. He would finish his career with four Olympic medals, but this would be his only gold. Schenk would soon become the greatest skater in the world, and one of the greatest ever.

Kristina Šmigun-Vähi (EST) also returned, and was aiming to become the first woman to successfully defend her Olympic title and, for a while, it looked as though she would be successful, coming home in a time of 25:05.0. However Charlotte Kalla (SWE) came through to defeat Šmigun-Vähi by 6.6 seconds. Kalla had won three gold medals at the Junior World Championships in 2006 and 2007, and in 2009, had won a bronze medal with the Swedish relay team at the World Championships.

All fighters losing to the finalists in each pool advance to repêchage tournament for the bronze medal.,na,"Jade Jones was Britain’s first ever taekwondo gold medallist in 2012 and was the clear favourite to retain the title in Rio. Known as “The Headhunter” she was the top ranked featherweight and went to Brazil having won the European title a few months earlier. Eva Calvo of Spain had emerged as a great new talent since the 2012 Olympics and for a brief spell had deprived Evans of the world number one spot, and was seeded two behind the Briton in Rio. The Spaniard was the European champion in 2014 and then won the 2015 World Championship 57kg silver medal. The rivalry has been intense and exciting between Jones and Calvo in the past three seasons, and fans dearly wanted to see them contest the Olympic final. Seeded number three was the Egyptian Hedaya Malak who beat both Jones and Calvo in the 2015 Grand Prix Series Final. Another one with a good chance of gold was the sixth seed Mayu Hamada of Japan who had also beaten the top two ranked fighters and was the reigning 57kg world champion.
Jones started the defence of her title with a 12-4 win over Naima Bakkal of Morocco before easing past the Belgian Raheleh Asemani 7-2, and that was followed by a 9-4 semi-final win over Nikita Glasnovic of Sweden. In the other half of the draw the Spanish second seed had a tougher passage to the final winning all three of her bouts by a single point and the semi-final against Malak being won on sudden-death, as that dream final with Jones was set up. Malak and Kimia Alizadeh of Iran, who had twice previously beaten Jade Jones, and was a 2014 Youth Olympic Games champion, won their bronze medal matches - it was the first ever Olympic medal won by an Iranian woman.
All eyes were on the gold medal match and the advantage was with Jones who had beaten Calvo in their last two meetings. The Briton raced into a 6-0 lead in the first round thanks to two successive head kicks, but at the end of round two Jones led by a single point at 7-6 and it remained close in the third until, towards the end of the contest, Jones delivered two more successful head kicks in quick succession to run out the 16-7 winner as she became the fourth Welsh gold medallist of the Games and only the third British woman to retain an individual title after Laura Trott and Charlotte Dujardin, who also retained their titles in Rio. She was also the youngest Briton to successfully defend an individual title.

For Sunisa Lee, she was not only the next in a long line of American winners of the all-round title, but it was the fifth in succession for the USA.

The young Canadian, Jones, also failed to advance. In the final, Borch got out quickly, being followed closely by Nielsen, but before long the Greek, Ntouskos, made a big push to take the lead and never looked back.

As the second Swiss bob slipped a bit further back with each run, the gap between the two leaders closed by a hundredth on both the second and third runs until the two teams were absolutely level with only the final run to go. Langen and last-minute substitute brakeman Markus Zimmerman could not match the Swiss start times throughout the competition and the final run was no exception.

Final placement was determined by a Majority Placement rule.  Thus, if a skater was ranked first by a majority of the judges, that skater was placed first overall, and the process was repeated for each place.  Ties were broken by a Subsequent Majority rule, i.e., if the skaters were ranked for the same position by the same number of judges, Majority Placement for the next higher position for each skater determined who was ranked higher.

At those Games, the winner of the slopestyle contest had been Canadian Dara Howell, but the fervor surrounding her triumph took an emotional toll and caused her skiing to suffer. Even after a year’s break from competition, she had produced only mediocre results on the international stage and was therefore not considered a particular favorite. The other medal winners from those Games, Devin Logan of the United States and Kim Lamarre of Canada, had also been inconsistent in recent years, leaving the competition in 2018 relatively e open. France’s Tess Ledeux was the reigning World Champion and was considered a fair bet to take gold, and certainly one of the favorites.
The qualification round proved difficult for many of the key figures in the tournament; Ledeux posted a moderate score in her first run and crashed out on her second, while both Howell and Lamarre fell victim to botched landings and were eliminated. While attention might have been focused the unlucky favorites in this round, there was no shortage of excellent runs from other competitors, and thus even Ledeux’s more successful first attempt failed to take her to the finals. Leading the qualifiers was Sweden’s Emma Dahlström, the 2015 Winter X Games champion and the 2017 World runner-up, with several others not far behind.
In the final, it was the relatively unheralded Swiss duo of Mathilde Gremaud and Sarah Höfflin who stole the show. Gremaud executed a difficult trick from the get-go and came out on top after the first run, while Höfflin held back somewhat, but still managed to perform impressively enough to land in second. Both skiers fell on their second run, but while Gremaud also failed in her third run, Höfflin successfully completed a complicated trick in her third run and earned a well-deserved gold medal. No one else topped Gremaud’s score from the first run, leaving her with silver, while Izzy Atkin of Great Britain, the 2017 World bronze medalist and 2018 Winter X Games runner-up, snatched bronze away from Maggie Voisin of the United States, the 2018 Winter X Games champion.

It was Canada that needed to make a comeback in the final as Norway took a three shot advantage early in the match but the Canadians did fight back and levelled the score at five-five going into the final end. The fate of the Olympic title came down to the final shot of the final end as the two teams were level on five apiece with Norway holding the winning stone but with Kevin Martin still to play. Martin’s stone took the right line but was fractionally too heavy and slipped past the required mark to ensure a surprise Norwegian victory. This was rather hard to see on TV, as the shot came from above, with Trulsen brushing above the stone, which was not visible on camera. Trulsen’s cheering was both visible and audible.

One such fighter was the Belgian Albert Robbe, an American newspaper reported that he had the reputation of being “Three parts fighting tiger to one part Jack Dempsey”. After his abysmal performance in losing to Ferenc Nagy of Hungary they changed this description to have him “stinking like a Gorgonzola cheese”.
Another favoured contender, the American Art Oliver, who had served as a sparring partner to the great Joe Louis, lost to the teenage Swede Olle Tandberg in his first bout. The most unusual performance of the tournament came from one of the Austrian coaches who, after his fighter Karl Lutz had lost to a boxer from Luxembourg, ran around the ring literally tearing his hair out; he pulled large tufts of his hair out as an apparent protest at the verdict.
The German champion Herbert Runge moved into the semi-finals with an easy knockout over a Czechoslovakian and a hard fought points victory over the British entry. His opponent in the semis should have been Nagy but the Hungarian had been injured in his defeat of Tandberg and was forced to withdraw from the tournament. The other semi-final pairing brought together Erling Nielsen of Norway, who had knocked out both his previous opponents and Guillermo Lovell of Argentina, brother of the 1932 heavyweight gold medallist, Alberto Lovell. Lovell’s raw aggression was a little too much for his Norwegian opponent, who had to settle for bronze.
The final started explosively with Lovell and Runge exchanging powerful punches throughout a reasonably even first round. The decisive moment came near the end of the second round when Runge knocked Lovell to the floor, the bell saved the Argentine from a possible stoppage. Runge had the upper hand from then on but although he ended the fight with what appeared to be bite marks on his shoulder, it was Runge who received two warnings from the British referee.
Runge, an apprentice butcher by trade, was eight times national amateur champion between 1935 and 1943 and was three times a medallist at the European Championships, although the Olympic gold was his only  major international title. Turning professional at the age of thirty-three he had an unsuccessful attempt at the German title. Erling Nielsen won a bronze medal at the 1937 Europeans but Olle Tandberg went on to win the gold at that tournament and retain it in 1939, he would have a favourite for the abortive 1940 Games. Tandberg had a professional career which culminated in a world heavyweight title eliminator against Jersey Joe Walcott. 43,000 spectators at the Råsunda Stadium, Stockholm watched Tandberg knocked down four times in a five-round defeat. Art Oliver was tragically killed in 1944 when a vehicle in which he was a passenger collided with a train.

East Germany had surprised everybody by placing second at the 1970 World Championship behind the Soviet team, ahead of Finland and Norway, but their ladies had not impressed in the individual events in Sapporo, with Renate Fischer’s ninth place in the 10 km race their best result.
On the first leg, Soviet’s Lyubov Mukhachova built up a clear lead, reaching the exchange over 15 seconds ahead of Helena Takalo for Finland. Four teams were close together, over half a minute behind Finland, with Helena Šikolová putting Czechoslovakia into third place, closely followed by Norway, East Germany and West Germany. Sweden, silver medalist from the 1968 Games, was far behind in eighth place, 1:43 behind the leader.
On the second leg Alevtina Olyunina increased the Soviet lead to 25 seconds with Finland’s Hilkka Kuntola still in a secure second position. Norway’s Aslaug Dahl had left the other teams behind and advanced to third, followed by East Germany, Czechoslovakia and West Germany.
Double Olympic Champion Galina Kulakova on the anchor leg secured the victory for Soviet and her third Olympic gold medal with a comfortable margin, 1:03 ahead of Finland’s Marjatta Kajosmaa. Norway’s Berit Mørdre-Lammedal had no problems to hold off her opponents for the bronze medal. Michaela Endler for West Germany, who started out as sixth, passed Czechoslovakia quickly and was able to outsprint East Germany’s Anni  Unger in the final part of the race in a close battle for fourth place.

Unlike Helsinki this was not a Hungarian sweep of the medals as the champions of 1948 and 1952, Aladár Gerevich and Pál Kovács respectively, faltered in the final pool. The nation’s tradition was instead upheld by Rudolf Kárpáti who was competing as an individual for the first time after winning team gold in 1948 and 1952. Kárpáti’s six victories out of seven in the pool was one more than the total achieved by Poland’s Jerzy Pawłowski who took silver. The bronze medal was won, after a barrage, by Lev Kuznetsov who became the Soviet Union’s first individual fencing medallist.
The lives of the gold and silver medallists were to go in vastly different ways. Kárpáti returned to Hungary, unlike many of his team mates, and flourished under the new government. He retained his Olympic title in 1960 then, in retirement, rose to become head of the national fencing federation.
Pawłowski, a major in the Polish Army, would win gold 12 years later in Mexico but was later revealed to be working for the CIA. After the discovery of his espionage he spent 12 years in prison.

At the World Championships in Davos, which had been held little more than a week before this Olympic contest, he had bettered Oscar Mathisen’s 14-year-old World Record of 43,4 by three tenths of a second. This record had not brought him the world title, which was taken by Clas Thunberg, a triple Olympic champion in Chamonix. Finn Thunberg, bronze medallist four years earlier, was also a contender in the shortest event, as were the other Norwegians: Haakon Pedersen, Oskar Olsen and Bernt Evensen.
The North Americans were somewhat of an enigma to the Europeans. They had skated in Norway, but only against second-rate Norwegians or on imperial distances. The first pair of the 500 m, with John O’Neil Farrell (USA) and Oskar Olsen (NOR), immediately showed what they were capable of. Farrell clocked 43.6, a new Olympic Record. The next race saw the two biggest title contenders pitted against each other. Roald Larsen took the early lead over Clas Thunberg, but the World Champion gained on the World Record holder in the back straight, making for an exciting sprint on the final 100 m. Thunberg won in an excellent time of 43.4, while Larsen equalled Farrell’s time. Haakon Pedersen went below 44 in the following race, but was already out of medal contention. The next big fight was between the two remaining Norwegians, Evensen and Olsen. The latter skated poorly, but 1927 World Champion Evensen went all out and stopped the watches at 43.4 - identical to Thunberg’s mark.
Finland’s Jaakko Friman, an outsider who had won the Finnish selection race for the Olympics, then also skated 43.6, making for two first place skaters, and three in third position. The last potential medallist was Charlie Gorman of Canada. He skated against Kos (NED), who fell in the first curve. Gorman, who finished 7th in the 43.9 claimed he was obstructed by his opponent’s fall. His protest was disallowed by the jury, which angered Gorman so much he withdrew from the 5000 m held later that same day. The Dutchman did re-skate, albeit out of competition. Kos’s 47.5 would have ranked him an ex aequo 21st. He was also unlucky in his other Olympic races, falling in both the 1500 m and 5000 m.
After the final pair, some of those in attendance expected tie-breaks for the title and third place, which was fairly common in those days. However, the rules did not allow for such a race and the result stood. It was the first time a gold medal was shared at the Winter Olympics. Evensen’s co-championship was the first speed skating gold for Norway.

Dominik Paris, also silver medalist at the 2013 World Championships, won the season opener in Lake Louise, but he was hindered after suffering a muscle injury in his lower left leg in December. Aksel Lund Svindal, reigning World Champion in 2013 and World Cup downhill winner of the last season, was the only racer to win twice (Beaver Creek and Bormio), while Erik Guay, World Champion in 2011, won in Val Gardena, Patrick Küng in Wengen, and Hannes Reichelt won the last World Cup downhill in Kitzbühel prior to the Games. So the downhill standings before the Games saw Svindal in the lead followed by Reichelt, Küng, and Guay. But Reichelt was not able to compete in Sochi as he underwent surgery for a disc herniation only two days after his win in Kitzbühel.

Both races were won by Beat Feuz, but he and Bode Miller injured their left knees in these races. While Miller returned to Sochi in top conditions Feuz had not regained his strength and was not expected to medal. Three training runs were held on 6-8 February all with perfect sunny weather. In the last run Rok Perko broke his nose after a fall and France’s Brice Roger tore his right ACL, eliminating both from the race the next day. The fastest in training were Miller, who won the first and third section, while Matthias Mayer topped the result of the second run.
On race day the weather was partly cloudy and the first Alpine skiing race in Sochi started with a delay of 15 minutes after a gondola problem. The early leader was third skier down Carlo Janka (SUI), reigning giant slalom champion, who posted a time of 2:06.71, a time which would ultimately see him place sixth. Travis Ganong (USA), skiing seventh, then beat this time by 0.07 seconds to take the lead. This was to be short-lived as the next skier down, Kjetil Jansrud, posted a time of 2:06.33. However, three starters later Matthias Mayer (AUT) went 0.1 seconds quicker to set what would prove to be the winning time of 2:06.23. Miller finished only eighth, and Svindal, whilst temporarily posting the third best time, eventually finished outside the medals in fourth. Christof Innerhofer (ITA), starting as the 20th competitor, skied the top half of the course well and threatened to win the gold medal but in the end slowed on the lower half of the course and just missed out by 0.06 seconds, settling for silver. Mayer, a surprise winner who only achieved a fifth place as his best result in a World Cup downhill prior to the Games, won with an average speed of 99.68 km/hr. Mayer also topped the family’s best result, winning the gold medal 26 years after his father Helmut won silver in the Super G in Calgary.

Cook had captained the British fencing team in Athina 1906. The British art criticer and writer had e tenure in the IOC from 1909-15 and edited the Official Report of the 1908 London Games.

The bronze medal was given to the Belgian Maurice Bladel for La Louange des Dieux, but very little is known about him, although he was probably an art critic. In 1915 he published a script Vampires, and later did a study about Georges van Eeckhoud, L’oeuvre de Georges Eekhoud (1922) and a book on Flemish posters (1924).

The United States had the second-best set of sprinters, but they were no match for the Jamaicans.
In the first heat Great Britain surprisingly finished first, ahead of the United States with Jamaica third, although they did not run their first squad. Britain was aided by the return of Dina Asher-Smith, who had injured her hamstring in the 100 and did not run the 200, in which she was favored. Germany won the second heat.
The final was close throughout, as Briana Williams started off for Jamaica, and handed off to Thompson-Herah, but they had no significant advantage over the USA, who opened with Javianne Oliver and Teahna Daniels. On the third leg Fraser-Pryce took over but could not gain ground on the turn against Jenna Prandini, primarily a 200 runner. The Jamaicans really only took the lead when Prandini and US anchor Gabrielle Thomas had a slightly rough exchange. That gave Jackson the gap she needed, and Jamaica won gold in 41.02, with the United States taking silver in 41.45. Great Britain anchor Daryll Neita closed quickly to bring them home for the bronze.
For Thompson-Herah this completed her sprint triple, after winning the 100 and 200 in Tokyo, making her only the fifth woman to win gold in the three sprint events – after Fanny Blankers-Koen (NED-1948), Betty Cuthbert (AUS-1956), Wilma Rudolph (USA-1960), and Florence Griffith Joyner (USA-1988).

1928 and the disputed pack style rules in 1932), the 500 m in Garmisch also saw controversy. The event was surprisingly won by Norway’s Ivar Ballangrud. Ballangrud, was hardly a rookie: he was already a triple Olympic medallist by that time, and was the World Champion of 1926, 1932, European Champion of 1929, 1930 and 1933. He had dominated the 1936 season, winning the European and World title in the month prior to the Games. However, Ballangrud was not considered a top sprinter, and even his selection for the Norwegian team on the distance was somewhat contentious. However, the controversy lay in the fact that he beat Georg Krog, Norway’s top sprinter. While the result of the official timekeepers all agree on the times of both skaters, various (Norwegian) journalists have different accounts. It was quite common in these days for the media to keep their own stopwatches, and check on the times. Some claim Krog’s time, officially 43.5, should have been four tenths faster - owing the difference to an ambiguous call by the timekeepers to the referee. Others claim Ballangrud’s time was simply one second too fast, and should have been 44.4 seconds. Norwegian radio reporter Finn Amundsen even re-timed Ballangrud’s race from the start and finish signals on his own audiotape, and clocked 44.4, like he had during the actual race. In spite of all this, no official protest appears to have been lodged, and the result stands as listed below.
Behind the two Norwegians, several favorites competed for third. Norway’s two other contenders, Harry Haraldsen and Hans Engnestangen both fell. All four United States skaters were medal potentials, despite the absence of defending Olympic Champion Jack Shea. He was not too fond of travelling to Nazi Germany, and could not afford to stay away from his family that long. Allan Potts had lowered the World Record to 42.4 the month before the Games, but he could do no better than 6th at the Olympics. Del Lamb, winner of the sprint at the World Championships placed 5th, which left Leo Freisinger, who won the bronze medal. He narrowly edged out Shozo Ishihara, who came within a tenth of Japan’s first Olympic speed skating medal.

Romero was absent because of the Soviet-led boycott, leaving Holyfield as the favorite in Los Angeles. Holyfield rolled through his first three matches, none going the distance, and in the semi-finals faced New Zealand’s Kevin Barry, the 1982 Commonwealth Games bronze medalist. Near the end of the second round, Holyfield hammered Barry’s ribs with a right, and then unloaded with a left hook that floored Barry. The official, a Yugoslav named Gligorije Novičić, waved Holyfield to a neutral corner and then counted out Barry. He then turned to Holyfield and disqualified him for a purported late hit, saying he had told him to break prior to the left hook. Films did seem to confirm this, but even Barry told Holyfield that “You won the fight fair and square.” The pro-American crowd went crazy, and Novičić had to receive a police escort to exit the arena. Barry had won, but could not fight in the finals because he had been knocked out and amateur rules prohibit a knocked out boxer from fighting for 28 days. This gave the gold medal to Ante Josipović, who like Novičić, was from Yugoslavia. During the victory ceremony, Josipović pulled Holyfield up to the top step of the podium. Josipović turned professional in 1990, fighting through 1995, and retiring after losing two bouts for the Croatian professional cruiserweight title. Holyfield turned professional right after the Los Angeles Olympics. Always in superb condition, with a chiseled body, he continued to fight through 2011, winning multiple world titles in both the cruiserweight and heavyweight divisions. His pro record at the end of 2011 was 44 wins, 10 losses, and 2 draws.

The IOC ruled that any player who had signed a professional contract was ineligible, while the IIHF ruled ineligible only those players who had played in a professional game.  The Canadian Hockey Association had its own definition, apparently cleared by the IIHF, which stated that a player was eligible if he had not played in 11 NHL games.  More problematic was that the European professionals were allowed to play and the eligibility rules only applied to NHL players and contracts.  Finally it was decided that a player could compete in the Olympics if he had not signed an NHL contract and played in an NHL game.  The gold and silver medals were won by the Soviet Union, once again, and Czechoslovakia.  The hypocrisy of the eligibility rules was apparent when one considers that both countries were represented by national teams consisting of players whose sole job was to play ice hockey for their country.  Though the players were “hidden” under the guise of a military job, they were as professional as any NHL player.

He had also won the last three giant slalom World Cup Globes and was the 2017 World Champion.
Other medal contenders were Henrik Kristoffersen from Norway, who was in second place in the seasonal World Cup, and Alexis Pinturault from France, third in the giant slalom World Cup, winner of the race in Val d’Isère on home soil and the bronze medalist from Sochi. Again racing in PyeongChang, and competing in his fourth Olympics, was the gold medalist from Sochi, Ted Ligety. He was also the last to beat Hirscher for the giant slalom Crystal Globe in the 2013/14 season and had also won the 2015 World Championships, but he had struggled with injuries in the last two seasons. Not competing was the Sochi silver medalist, Steve Missillier, who was out for the season with back pain.
In the first run Pinturault, bib #1, made use of the perfect conditions and set the pace with 1:08.90. Only Hirscher, bib #5, was able to surpass the Frenchman with a big margin of 0.63 seconds. After the first run, a similar margin separated the next eight racers as Žan Kranjec in ninth position, was 0.62 seconds behind Pinturault, followed by Kristoffersen in 10th.
In the second run Ryan Cochran-Siegle, placed 21st after the first run, clocked the third best time to finish 11th overall and, with the best time of the second run, Kristoffersen won silver, just 4/100ths of a second ahead of Pinturault. Hirscher was untouchable, with the second-best time in the second run to become the first and only double Olympic champion in Alpine skiing at these Games. He dominated the event as Kristoffersen was 1.27 seconds in arrears. The three favorites shared the medals and were in the same order as in the seasonal giant slalom World Cup. Hirscher raced Atomic, Kristoffersen used Rossignol, and Pinturault won bronze with Head skis.

The old Kongsberg style developed in Norway after World War I, had the upper body bent at the hip, a wide forward lean, and arms extended in front of the skies parallel to each other. The Däscher style with stretched hip and arms placed backward for a closer lean reduced the air resistance and made it possible for the jumpers to improve their distance. German and Finnish jumpers were quick to adapt to the new technique, and one of the most skilled practitioners of the new technique was the best Soviet ski jumper, Georgian K’oba Ts’akadze. His body was so close to his skies that his breast almost touched the front part of his skies.
The 1956 Olympic ski jumping competition was the real breakthrough for the aerodynamic technique. In the first round, Antti Hyvärinen, seventh in the 1952 games and jumping first of the favorites, took the lead with an 81 metre jump. The 23 year old German from Oberstdorf, Max Bolkart, jumped 80 metres  and equaled Hyvärinen’s points with his better style. Harry Glaß, a 25-year old from Klingenthal, East Germany, then made an excellent jump of 83,5 metres and was in the lead. Next to jump was Aulis Kallakorpi of Finland, winner at Holmenkollen in 1955. He equaled Glaß’ length and was in second position, only 0,5 points behind the German. Jumping last of the 51 competitors, Andreas Däscher made a good jump of 82 metres and was in sixth position after the first round.
In the second round, Hyvärinen took an early lead with an excellent jump of 84 metres, the longest of the day. Ts’akadze, lying seventh after first round, made a gallant try to fight for a top placing, but fell after an 82,5 metre jump and was out of contention for the medals. Next of the favorites to challenge Hyvärinen’s lead was Harry Glaß, the first-round leader. He could only manage 80,5 metres and was 2,5 points behind Hyvärinen. Next to come was Kallakorpi, second-placed after the first round. He equaled Glaß’ distance, and better style points brought him into the silver medal position with the closest possible margin, only 0,5 points. It ended with a Finnish double, with an East German jumper taking the bronze medal.
For Norway, the nation who had dominated the six former Olympic jumping competitions, winning all six and taking 14 out of 18 possible medals, the result came as a shock, their best jumper placing only ninth. The Norwegians had been reluctant to adapt to the new aerodynamic style and was severely punished for this. The era of Norwegian domination in ski jumping was definitely over.

She won the overall World Cup four times, in 2013, 2014, 2016 and 2017. In the Olympic season, Norwegian Maren Lundby emerged as a clear favorite, winning 7 out of 10 World Cup competitions in the weeks before the Games.

Dibiasi won his third consecutive gold medal, with Louganis getting silver, only to see him dominate diving over the next 12 years. In Seoul, the men’s platform event evoked memories of Montréal, with Louganis now the world’s greatest diver, but he was challenged by the new next great thing, China’s 14-year-old Xiong Ni. Louganis had won this event in 1984, and had already won the springboard in Seoul, after the trauma of hitting his head on the board on a qualifying dive.
The event was very close in the final, with no more than 10 points separating either diver after every round. After nine rounds, Xiong led by 3.00 points, and he dove first on the final round. He ripped his inward 3½ tuck for a 9.0 and four 8.5s, scoring 82.56 points. Louganis had chosen a reverse 3½ tuck on his final effort, the so-called “Dive of Death,” so named because Soviet diver Sergey Chalibashvilli had died after attempting the dive and hitting his head on the platform at the 1983 Universiade. But Louganis performed it well, not perfectly, but well, and scored all 8.5s from the judges. With the DD of 3.4, this gave him 85.56 points for the dive and the gold medal by 1.14 points.
Louganis announced his retirement from diving a few weeks after the Seoul Olympics. He is considered the greatest diver of all-time, having won the diving double-double in 1984 and 1988, a World diving double-double in 1982 and 1986, and a Pan American Games triple-double in 1979, 1983, and 1987. Only the 1980 USA-led boycott of the Moscow Olympics prevented him from a probable triple-double at the Olympics.
Xiong was far from finished. He won a bronze medal on platform at the 1992 Olympics, and then won three gold medals, on springboard in 1996 and 2000, and in synchro springboard in 2000. His great opponent in the 1990s, Dmitry Sautin, would later call him the “King of Divers.”

The South American “Las Leonas” had claimed the 2010 world title on their home pitch in Rosario, beating the Dutch in the final. They had also claimed the Champions Trophy in 2009, 2010 and 2012. After silver in 2000 and bronze in 2004 and 2008, the Argentineans were now aiming for Olympic gold. Star player Lucha Aymar, known as the )Maradona of hockey), was the country’s flagbearer, signifiying their expectations. It’s noteworthy that the team failed to qualify from the Americas via the Pan American Games, losing to the United States in the final. But as South Africa withdrew its direct qualification, Argentina was granted a spot on account of their #1 world ranking, thus avoiding having to play a qualification tournament. The Dutch were eager to retain their Beijing title. Since 2008, they had lost some of their veteran players, and had switched to an Argentine coach, Max Caldas. They had beaten Argentina in the 2011 Champions Trophy (after penalty strokes), and won the European title that same year. Much was also expected from the British women, who had made the final of the 2012 Champions Trophy, as well as traditional top nations Germany and Australia.
The Dutch team, who lost key defender Willemijn Bos to injury in the last practice match before the Olympics, won all of their pool A matches, albeit four of them with only one goal difference. The British also qualified for the semis, despite a loss to 2008 finalist China, which missed out on qualification due to disappointing results against débutants Belgium and Japan. In the other pool, things were very close. Argentina, New Zealand and Australia all had three wins and one loss, with Argentina having the best goal difference. After New Zealand drew with Germany in the morning, Australia needed to beat Argentina to win, but Las Leonas kept it to 0-0 to advance. For New Zealand, it was the first time their team reached the Olympic semi-finals - in 2008, they had finished last.
The semi-finals were closely contested affairs: New Zealand and the Netherlands drew 2-2 and duked it out in the penalty shoot-out. Dutch goalie Joyce Sombroek provided three saves to help her team advance to their third consecutive final. Argentina had taken a comfortable 2-0 lead, but had to fight off the British for the last five minutes after Alex Danson scored. In the anticipated final, penalty corners proved decisive. The first goal was somewhat controversial, as an earlier Dutch foul had been missed by the referees, but Carlien Dirkse van den Heuvel’s rebound goal counted. A few minutes later, penalty corner specialist Maartje Paumen put away the second goal, to earn the Dutch their third women’s hockey title, the same number of titles as Australia. Of note, four members of the Dutch team were openly gay, the highest known number of any Olympic team: Paumen, Dirkse van den Heuvel, Kim Lammers and Marilyn Agliotti. The first two were even in a relationship together for some years, but this ended shortly after the Olympics.

Germany continued to dominate in the final, winning gold by a margin of almost two seconds ahead of the Swiss crew who earned their nation’s first, and as of 2012 only, Olympic medal in canoeing. The Swiss women had accomplished this feat by winning a fierce five-way battle that ended with Switzerland, Sweden, China, Canada, and Spain finishing in that order within 0.876 seconds of each other.

The 1948 Olympic decathlon was also affected by the absence of the man who was likely the best in the world in the late 40’s – Heino Lipp. Lipp was Estonian but his country had been annexed by the Soviet Union and since the USSR did not compete in the Olympics until 1952, he could not compete at London. In addition, Lipp was labeled by Soviet authorities as a risk to defect and it is likely he would not have been allowed to travel, even if the USSR had sent a team to London. In Lipp’s absence the favorite was probably the Frenchman, Ignace Heinrich. The 1948 AAU/Olympic Trials champion had been Bob Mathias, a 17-year-old who had competed in his first decathlon only two weeks before the AAU Meet. He had defeated Floyd )Chunk) Simmons and Irv )Moon) Mondschein, who had been 1-2 at the 1947 AAUs, but Mathias was thought to be too young to contend for the gold medal in London.
The Argentine, Enrique Kistenmacher, led after the first day with Heinrich second. The second day had miserable conditions, with cold, rainy weather present throughout. Mathias took the lead after the discus throw, although in that event, officials had lost the marker on his best throw, and he likely lost several feet, and points, because of that. He held on to win the event from there, with Heinrich placing second when he outran Simmons in the 1,500. Thru 2008, Mathias remains the youngest man to have won an Olympic gold medal in track & field athletics. Though Heino Lipp never was able to compete at the Olympics, when Estonia returned to the Olympics at Barcelona in 1992, he was chosen as the Estonian flag bearer at the Opening Ceremony.

China’s Shi Tingmao was the only woman to win two gold medals in Rio and was a clear favourite to add another in Tokyo. At the 2019 World Championships Tingmao and Wang Han occupied first and second place in the springboard event, just as they had done two years earlier. They were also fresh from winning the synchronised title at Tokyo 2020.
It was hard to imagine anybody, other than the two Chinese divers, occupying the gold and silver position, but the best chance of the bronze medal was with the Canadians Jennifer Abel and Pamela Ware. Abel had finished second, with Mélissa Citrini-Beaulieu, behind Tongmao and Han in the synchronised event three days earlier. Abel medalled behind Tingmao and Han at the 2017 World Championships, but beat the two Chinese divers to win the 2019 World Series. Kim Su-Ji of Korea was third in the 1-metre springboard event at the 2019 World Championships and was a possible threat to the Canadians for the bronze medal.
Tingmao and Han dominated the preliminary round, scoring 350.45 and 347.25 respectively, with Abel and Ware next, but approximately 20 points behind. Japan’s Sayaka Mikami was fifth while the leading American was Hailey Hernandez. Tingmao led from the first round of dives, and while Han dropped to fourth at one stage, she pulled herself back into it with good fourth and fifth dives.
The Chinese pair dominated the semi-final that reduced the field from 18 to 12, but it was Han who led after the first three dives, with Tingmao down in joint seventh after her opening dive. Dive four, however, saw her outscore Han by more than 18 points and leapfrog her into first place. She stayed there, with Tingmao qualifying for the final in second place.
Abel always looked like qualifying and was never lower than third place. Her fellow Canadian Pamela Ware, however, was eliminated in 18th place after failing to score with her last dive. She was forced to abandon the dive after mis-stepping on the board and just jumped feet first into the water instead of possibly injuring herself if she dived. A similar thing happened to Mexico’s Arantxa Chávez during her third dive in the preliminary round.
For the Chinese pair, the final was no different, with Tingmao dominating proceedings from the first dive and winning her fourth gold over the past two Olympics, by 34.75 points from Han. A delighted Krysta Palmer of the United States, a mixed team bronze medallist in the 2018 World Cup, took bronze thanks to a forward 2.5 somersault with two twists with her final dive that yielded 73.10 and put her ahead of Malaysia’s Nur Dhabitah Binti Sabri. Abel was a favourite to secure bronze going into the final and after two dives was in the bronze medal position. After a failed reverse 2.5 somersaults in the third round, she scored just 39.00 points and slipped to ninth, never recovering.
China won their ninth consecutive springboard gold medal, and Shi Tingmao re-confirmed that she was the leading female diver in the world and two further golds in Tokyo took her total of Olympic and World gold medals to 12.

The gold medal was won by French Géo-Charles for The Olympic Games. Géo-Charles was the pseudonym of Charles Guyot, who became best known as the Olympic Literary Man. He was also active in several sports activities.
The silver medals were awarded to British writer Dorothy Margaret Stuart and Danish author Josef Petersen. Stuart received it for Sword Songs. She joined The English Association in 1930 and was a member of the Executive Committee from 1937-61, Honorary Secretary of the Association from 1949-51, and edited the News-Letter from it’s inception in 1946 to 1961. She was known for her literary criticism and for several historical biographies. Petersen wrote mostly about ancient and medieval motifs and was well recognized for his knowledge of ancient cultures, but not from the contemporary literary criticism. He won all his Olympic art medals (1924, 1932 and 1948) with works on ancient Greek sports motifs, in 1924 for Euryale.
The bronze medals went to French Charles Anthoine Gonnet for Face to Face with Olympia’s God and Irish Oliver St. John Gogarty for Ode to the Tailteann Games. Gonnet also played rugby for the French national team from 1921-27. In 1924, he was a substitute for the French national team at the Paris Olympics, but did not play in any match. He was also an athlete, swimmer and boxer. Besides his writing Gogarty was a physician, sportsman, pilot and politician, and from 1922-36 served as a senator in the Irish Parliament.

Her time held up until the 55th starter came into the stadium, Svetlana Paramygina, who was leading the seasonal World Cup. Paramygina narrowly edged out Tserbe-Nessina, finishing in 26:09.9, although she had missed two targets early in her race. Canadian Myriam Bédard, the 1993 World Champion in the event, started right after Paramygina, and later entered the stadium with almost the same time as the two leaders. But Bédard finished strongly and crossed the line in 26:08.8, despite her two missed targets during the race. With the drama seemingly played out, the 62nd starter, Kazakhstan’s Inna Sheshkil came into the stadium, on the same pace as the leaders. But struggling from fatigue, she fell only two metres from the line, and although she got up and finished, she was 3.9 seconds out of the medals.
This was Bédard’s second gold medal in Lillehammer as she had already won the 15 km individual race. Her life after biathlon was not as easy for her. She first tried to switch to speed skating, without success. In 2002, while working in marketing with Via Rail, she raised concerns about the company’s financial dealings. She would later claim that, because of this, she was forced to leave that job. This would only become known in 2004 during the sponsorship scandal which occurred after Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chrétien left office.  She would later make headlines in December 2006 when she was arrested in Maryland, was charged with illegally spiriting her daughter out of Canada, violating a custody agreement she had with her ex-husband, and would be sentenced to two years probation.

The bronze medalist from 1992, Curt Harnett (CAN), was also back but like Fiedler, had had few podium finishes since 1992. Neiwand led the qualifiers over Harnett and Nothstein.

Nothstein defeated Harnett in the other semi, also in straights. In the first race of the final, only the photo-finish could separate the riders, the victory going to Fiedler by one centimeter.

Grut also won the swimming, thus winning three of the five phases of the modern pentathlon, and he led Moore 8-43 going into the run. He placed eighth in the cross-country run to finish with only 16 points, well ahead of Moore, who placed fourth in cross-country and won the silver medal with 47 points. Grut’s teammate, Gösta Gårdin, placed third with 49 points. Grut’s father, Torben, had been the architect of the Stockholm Olympic Stadium used for the 1912 Olympics.

Top 25 after first round of jumping advanced to second round of jumping - limit of three riders per nation.",na,"Pippa Funnell of Great Britain had dominated eventing in 2003, winning the )Grand Slam of Eventing) with victories at Burleigh, Lexington and Badminton, but it was felt the change of format was detrimental to her chances. The husband and wife pairing of Australian Andrew Hoy and his wife Bettina, riding for Germany, were expected to figure prominently as were riders from France, including World champion Jean Teulère, the USA and New Zealand. The competition ran concurrently with the team competition with the addition of an extra round of jumping for the top 25 in the standings which would decide the individual medals.
Nicolas Touzaint of France held the lead after the dressage phase with Pippa Funnell and Bettina Hoy close on his heels. The use of the short format cross-country phase meant that over three-quarters of the field finished without either a fall or a refusal and also that a finish within the time limit became even more important. Most of the top riders kept in contention though Andew Hoy suffered a fall and Funnell conceded ground when her horse was too slow around the course. Touzaint increased his lead slightly with Bettina Hoy moving to second and American Kim Severson third. The fifth and six placed riders Ingrid Klimke of Germany and Britain’s William Fox-Pitt withdrew prior to the compulsory veterinary inspection when it became apparent that their horses could not continue.
Touzaint and Severson both knocked one fence down in the first round of jumping whilst Bettina Hoy appeared to have produced a faultless round and closed the gap on the leader. During the intervals between the two rounds the Grand Jury announced that Hoy had been penalized with 14 time faults. Television pictures revealed she had crossed the start line, triggering the electronic timing, and then turned full circle and crossed the start line again. A meeting of the Jury of Appeal was convened after a German protest and “In the interests of fairness” Hoy’s score was returned to its’ original mark. The judge in charge of the timing had, against the rules, re-set the primary timer to zero when the rider passed the starting beam on the second occasion. An FEI spokesman said that “The change of the result is due to a wrong start procedure, which has been confirmed by the jury.”
Eleventh after the cross country, Leslie Law had posted a clear round in the first round of jumping and the Briton repeated this feat in the second round. He then watched as both Funnell and Severson knocked a single fence over and fell behind him in the standings. It was then the turn of Bettina Hoy to compete, but she also made a single mistake and was also over the time allowed although it was enough to keep her ahead of Law. The last rider was the leader, Touzaint, his advantage was such that he could afford to knock over two fences and still win the gold. Touzaint’s chances, even of a medal, were over before the halfway point of the round. He knocked down four fences and added three time penalties as well to ensure that Bettina Hoy was Olympic champion.
The French, British and US teams immediately launched an appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) concerning the results. On 20 August the CAS released their decision, stating that the judges’ decision should not have been reversed by the FEI because the body had no right to do so. The Jury of Appeal had only the right to make decisions regarding the interpretation of rules and the CAS said it decided that the judges’ decision to impose a time penalty on Hoy “was of a purely factual nature, falling within its exclusive jurisdiction.”
Hoy’s added penalties meant that she dropped back to ninth place and Leslie Law was elevated to Olympic champion. Severson and Funnell moved to silver and bronze respectively. Law had ridden his luck to the title, his horse Shear L’Eau was notoriously suspicious of water obstacles on the cross-country phase and had struggled in Athina to the point of landing on top of one of the fences. He struggled over the fence and was similarly lucky in both jumping phases when poles rattled, bounced but somehow stayed horizontal. Law had returned home before the CAS revealed their decision and had the unusual sensation of being told he was a gold medallist by phone call whilst riding in a competition for novice horses in the English Midlands. He was later awarded his medal during a reception for the British Olympic team at Buckingham Palace.
This was not the end of the controversy concerning the three-day event. In October 2004 the FEI revealed that two horses had returned positive dope tests, Austrian Harald Riedl and his horse Foxy XX were disqualified from the event but the circumstances concerning the other positive test were more contentious. It was revealed that Bettina Hoy’s horse Ringwood Cockatoo had hydroxy-diphenhydramine in his system. Hoy stated that she had approached a )man in a white coat) who she believed was an FEI vet and was given verbal permission to administer the drug. Despite the fact that written permission must be given before this drug can be legally administered to a horse, she was cleared of any wrongdoing and her results were allowed to stand. The “man in a white coat” has never been identified.

The Norwegian Bjørn Wirkola had won both ski jumping competitions at the World Championships in Oslo 1966 and had dominated the international scene in the following years, winning at Holmenkollen in 1966 and 1967 and the 1967 and 1968 Four Hills Tournament.
In the Normal Hill competition, the young Soviet jumper Anatoly Zheglanov took an early lead with an excellent jump of 79.5 m. The Austrian Baldur Preiml, starting 28th, produced the longest jump of the day with 80.0 m and was still in the lead until one of the last starters, Czechoslovakian Jiří Raška jumped 79.0 m with superb style and bettered Preindl’s total points. The 21-year old Finn Topi Mattila was lying third after the first round, beating Zheglanov’s point score with a 78.0 m jump. Wirkola was a disappointing sixth.
In the second round the jumps were considerably shorter. Austrian Reinhold Bachler produced the longest jump of the round with 76.0 m and advanced from eighth to the silver medal position. Raška had a more mediocre jump of 72.5 m but claimed the first ever gold medal in ski jumping for Czechoslovakia. Preindl was able to hold off Wirkola in the battle for the bronze medal. Defending Champion Veikko Kankkonen was a distant 17th, seemingly totally out of form.

In the first two rounds at Seoul, Lewis had the fastest times. The two semis were won by Reynolds and Lewis, with 1987 World Champion Thomas Schönlebe (GDR) failing to qualify. In the final, Everett opened up early and led to 200 metres. Lewis then took the lead but Reynolds was closing. His last 100 was the fastest but he narrowly missed catching Lewis, who won the gold.

The piste was located between the men’s and women’s speed course within the Rosa Khutor Alpine Center. The start was at an altitude of 1,160 metres and the run ended as all other Alpine skiing events in the same finishing area. The first run started in the late afternoon with cloudy weather, with spring-like temperatures between 7 (start) and 10 (finish) degrees, while the second run was held as a night-race under floodlights with a clear sky and temperatures still between 5 and 6 degrees. The snow was a main factor in this race. A lot of salt was scattered as it was necessary to firm up the snow surface, which was softened by high temperatures. But this refroze the surface causing problems as it soon become weak again and turned into slush.
The season underway saw seven World Cup slaloms held with only Marcel Hirscher (Levi and Adelboden) and Felix Neureuther (Bormio and Kitzbühel) winning twice. The other races were won by Mario Matt (Val d’Isère), Alexis Pinturault (Wengen), and Henrik Kristoffersen, who won the last World Cup slalom prior to the Games in Schladming. The current standings saw Hirscher in the lead followed by Neureuther and Kristoffersen. Hirscher also won the slalom World title in 2013 and the slalom World Cup of the last season 2012/13. Neureuther placed second both times, but his condition was uncertain after a car accident in Germany a week earlier, which caused a whiplash injury. Also considered to be strong were Jean-Baptiste Grange (World champion in 2011) and the Swedes André Myhrer (slalom World Cup winner 2011-12) and Mattias Hargin.
Going first on the fresh snow Myhrer (SWE) set the target time of 47.15. His compatriot, Hargin, was next to go and he too set a good time of 47.45. Third skier down, Matt (AUT), was to set the fastest time of the first run in 46.70. None of the other skiers was able to better any of these times, although Stefano Gross (ITA), starting 17th, managed to equal the time of Hargin for joint third place.
The second run was, like the slalom part of the Super Combined six days earlier, set by Ivica Kostelić’s father Ante. He, not for the first time, created an unusual and controversial course. Ted Ligety called it “borderline unsportsmanlike”, but as always, Kostelić answered that the top skiers also had to be smart and they should be able to race this run. With the top 30 going in reverse order the second run produced all the drama, with the early leader being Kristoffersen (NOR), starting 1.79 seconds behind Matt in 15th place, posting a combined time of 1:42.67. This time was not challenged until Hirscher (AUT), ninth after the first run, put in a storming run of 54.14 to go into the lead with a combined time of 1:42.12. Remarkably the next four skiers, Pinturault (FRA), Neureuther (GER), Ligety (USA), and Grange (FRA) all failed to finish the course. Hargin’s second run contained mistakes and he couldn’t repeat his finish of the first run, eventually finishing down in joint seventh. Gross, for a while, threatened to get into the medals and his combined time of 1:42.72 was good enough to put him in joint third place at that stage. When Myhrer also failed to complete the course, it came down to Matt’s second run to determine the medals. His experience was to carry him through and, whilst only the sixth fastest run, came through with a combined time of 1:41.84 to take the final Alpine skiing gold medal of the Games. Adam Žampa (SVK), with a time of 53.94, skied the fastest second run but, having been 26th after the first run, was never in contention for a medal and finished sixth.
Matt, who turned 35 years of age in April 2014, became the oldest Olympic Alpine skiing champion ever, while bronze medalist Kristoffersen, only 19, became the ever youngest male Olympic Alpine skier on the podium. Matt, skiing on Blizzards, won the only Alpine skiing medal for them in Sochi, while silver was won on Atomic, and bronze on Rossignol. Finishing 43th and last in this race was French-born Yohan Gonçalves the first ever Winter Olympic competitor from Timor-Leste. Hubertus von Hohenlohe did not have the luck to finish the race when he struggled in the first run. It was only the second time he failed to finish in 15 Olympic events in six Olympic Winter Games over a period of 30 years. With his six participations he equalled the record for Alpine skiers held by Marco Büchel and became the oldest ever Alpine skiing competitor aged 55.

In the snatch, he seemingly lifted 132.5 kg on his third attempt, but in a gesture of good sportsmanship, pointed out to the judges that his knee had touched down, negating the lift. His final victory margin of 37.5 kg would remain the greatest ever in Olympic weightlifting until 2004, when Iran’s Hossein Reza Zadeh would win the super-heavyweight division by 38.5 kg. Stanczyk returned in 1952 and won the silver medal at Helsinki, trailing Soviet lifter Trofim Lomakin.

However, behind him, a great battle ensued for the other medals.  Everett Bradley (USA), Hugo Lahtinen (FIN), Bob LeGendre (USA), Helge Løvland (NOR), and Brutus Hamilton (USA) were separated by only three points on the point-for-place scoring system.
Bradley won the silver medal.  Lahtinen took the bronze medal in a tie-breaker with LeGendre in which the decathlon scoring tables were used.  Løvland again narrowly beat out Hamilton, this time for 5th place, and again the decathlon scoring tables were needed to break the tie.    In addition to his gold medal, Lehtonen was also awarded the Challenge Prize that had been donated by the King of Sweden.  In addition to his gold medal, Løvland was also awarded the Challenge Prize that had been donated by the Russian Emperor.

But neither had been undefeated in the 1948 season. Although Farstad had won his distance at the Norwegian Championships, he had been defeated by Odd Lundberg and Gunnar Konsmo, while Seyffarth had been bested by compatriot Göthe Hedlund. Hedlund had in fact clocked the best time of the season, setting 2.18,4 in a test race in St. Moritz shortly before the Games.
Again, the weather in St. Moritz was ideal, still and sunny, allowing for fine ice conditions and fast times. The first favorite in competition was Farstad. He sped to an excellent 2.17,6, shattering the Olympic Record as well as his personal best. This time seemed hard to beat. While Lundberg could go under 2.20 with 2.18,6, Hedlund couldn’t approach his time from earlier in the week and only managed 2.20,7. Then Seyffarth started in pair 14. He went all out from the start, with the fastest opening of the day. At the bell, he was still leading over Farstad, but then started to fade. Farstad’s final lap had been strong, and Seyffarth couldn’t match it, finishing half a second behind the Norwegian. There was one more skater that beat 2.20 – World Champion Lassi Parkkinen – but his time was not good enough for a podium spot.

Eighteen days before they started, the Soviet Union invaded Hungary in response to a student-led revolution that had started on 23 October. The revolt spread quickly and the government fell, which led the USSR to send in 200,000 troops. By 10 November the Soviets had put down the revolution, installing their own puppet government, killing thousands of Hungarians, with over 200,000 fleeing the country. In response to Soviet actions, Spain, Switzerland and the Netherlands boycotted the Melbourne Olympics, with the Dutch water polo team sorely missed as they had placed fourth at the 1954 Europeans. Hungary competed in Melbourne, but many of their athletes would defect, often later competing for other nations. Nowhere was the conflict between the two nations seen more clearly at the Olympics than in the water polo pool.
Hungary had won the last two Olympic gold medals and was considered the top side in the world. They advanced to the final round, along with Yugoslavia, Italy, and the Soviets. On 6 December Hungary and the Soviet Union met in a water polo match that reverberated throughout the world. The water was crimson as Hungary attacked the Soviet players, who likewise retaliated. One famous picture shown on wire services was of Hungarian player Ervin Zádor, his head cut, with blood streaming down his face as he stepped out of the pool. The match had to be stopped by the referee before the end of the regular time, with Hungary leading 4-0. They would go undefeated in Melbourne in 1956 and win the gold medal, the Soviets taking bronze, behind Yugoslavia.

This time the sides never came to a consensus, however, with the final stumbling block announced as the failure of the IIHF and the IOC to provide health insurance coverage for the NHL players, and in 2017 the NHL prohibited any player under NHL contract from playing for their nation at the PyeongChang Winter Olympics.
This was expected to greatly impact the quality of play at PyeongChang as the world’s best players – both European and North American – played professionally in the NHL. Most sides were forced to use their second-tier players, many from minor leagues in North America or those playing in the Kontinental Hockey League (KHL) in Russia, considered the world’s second best league after the NHL.
Since the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, and the resultant dissolution of their dominant hockey team, Russia had not won a gold medal at the Winter Olympics, despite being a hockey power, and this had upset the Russian sports hierarchy, particularly when they failed to even come close to a medal at Sochi in 2014, finishing fifth on home soil.
Further, with the doping scandals that had enveloped Russian athletes since the 2008 Olympics, it was not even certain if Russia would be allowed to compete. Eventually a compromise was reached in which certain Russian athletes, usually with no doping history, were allowed to compete, but under the moniker Olympic Athletes from Russia (OAR). In addition, no Russian flags were to be displayed during the Games, there were restrictions on the uniforms used, and, at victory ceremonies, the Russian national anthem would not be played.
Without the NHL players, it was very difficult to choose a favorite in PyeongChang, although Russia, or the Olympic Athletes from Russia, was expected to be strong because it could call on a number of KHL players who were just below the level of the NHL.
There were three pools of four teams each, with the Czech Republic, Sweden, and the Olympic Athletes from Russia (OAR) winning their respective pools. All 12 teams advanced to the knock-out round, with those three, joined by Canada, second in Pool A, advancing directly to the quarter-finals, while the other eight teams played a single-elimination round to reach the quarters.
Canada, Czech Republic, and OAR all won their quarter-finals, but the big surprise was Germany, who were at 60-1 odds before the Games began, upsetting Sweden, 4-3, to advance to the semi-finals. Germany continued its miracle run with a 4-3 defeat of Canada in the semis, and advanced to the finals where they would meet the OAR. The Germans did not even make the tournament in 2014 and had not won an Olympic match since 2002.
Playing for Olympic gold, OAR led with seven minutes remaining in the final, but Germany scored two goals, and took a 3-2 lead with only three minutes remaining. With their goalie pulled, Nikita Gusev tied the score with 55.5 seconds remaining in regulation, sending the game into 4-on-4 sudden-death overtime. In overtime, Kirill Kaprizov scored the golden goal on a power play with 10:20 remaining in overtime and OAR took the gold medal, finally winning 26 years after the Unified Team, the remnant of the Soviet Union, had won gold at Albertville in 1992.
At the victory ceremony, the “Russian” team and their fans decided they had had enough and stood together and sang the Russian national anthem, despite the prohibition about that anthem being played in PyeongChang (as a recording of the IOC’s anthem played over the arena sound system). In the crowd, one row of fans wore red shirts spelling out “Russia In My Heart”, while a few rows down more fans wore t-shirts that spelled out the team’s nickname, “Red Machine”, in both English and Cyrillic.

The top two teams in each pool were advanced to the semi-finals, with four final matches used to determine final placements.
The Soviets were favored, having won the 1970 Worlds, the 1968 Olympics, and the last four European titles. Their main opponent was expected to be their long-time rival, Japan, the 1964 Olympic champion. Japan and the USSR both won their pools with undefeated records, and were joined in the semis by the two Koreas. This was not considered an upset as Korea had been third at the 1967 Worlds and North Korea (DPR Korea) third at the 1970 Worlds. But they were both defeated fairly easily in the semis by the favorites, setting up the hoped-for final. And it was quite a final. The two teams alternated sets, with the Soviet Union eventually winning 15-11, in the fifth.
In the bronze medal match, DPR Korea easily defeated Korea in three sets, 7, 9, and 9. After the match, the South Koreans claimed that the top PRK player Kim Zung-Bok was a man, not a woman. Their protest was disallowed, as the IOC had issued sex tests prior at these Olympics, and Kim had passed them. But according to the South Koreans, she had been substituted in the test by another player, Han Jong-Suk, who did not play at the Olympics.

He was World Champion in 1958 and 1962 and Olympic Champion in 1956. His only loss in a major championships was when he placed fifth in the 1960 Olympic Games. In the 1962 World Championships he won by a comfortable margin ahead of countryman Assar Rönnlund and defending Olympic Champion Kalevi Hämälainen. The 50 km was organized three days after the 15 km race and one day before Jernberg’s 35th birthday.
Hämälainen was in the lead after 10 km, 14 seconds ahead of Harald Grønningen and with Rönnlund and Jernberg close behind. At the halfway point Hämälainen had increased his lead to 49 seconds, with Rönnlund now in second position and Jernberg close behind in third. At 35 km Hämälainen was apparently struggling, Jernberg now in second place was only 20 seconds behind. The Norwegian Einar Østby was now in third place almost half a minute behind Jernberg, closely followed by Arto Tiainen, an experienced Finnish skier (aged 33) competing in his third Olympics. Rönnlund was down in fifth place but still in contention for the medals, only 18 seconds behind Østby. Another Swede, Janne Stefansson, was moving steadily ahead and had advanced to sixth place.
In the final part of the race defending champion Hämälainen “hit the wall” and lost almost 9 minutes to Jernberg in the last 15 km. He ended in sixteenth place. Jernberg had complete control over his opponents and finished in superb style, winning his third Olympic gold medal, over a minute ahead of team-mate Rönnlund, who after a good finish secured a Swedish double. A tired Tiainen snatched the bronze medal only six seconds ahead of Stefansson, preventing a clean sweep for the Swedes. The fastest finisher of all was the Norwegian favorite Sverre Stensheim, winner of the Holmenkollen 50 km three times in a row (1959-1961). He advanced from a modest 13th place at the halfway point ending fifth, only 17 seconds from the bronze medal. Double Olympic Champion Eero Mäntyranta was apparently tired after his two victories earlier in the week and ended up ninth.

The home team needed to overcome Canada in the quarter-finals, which they only managed in the final laps, as Christine Nesbitt faded on the Canadian side. The other three races weren’t so close, Poland dismissing Norway, Japan beating Korea and the Netherlands breaking the Olympic Record against the United States. Like Poland in the men’s event, the Japanese women didn’t put up an effort against the Dutch in the semi-finals, but the Dutch didn’t seem to care, bettering their own Olympic Record. The other semi-final saw Poland solidly beat Russia, leading the host nation from start to finish. Poland, which had won a surprise bronze in 2010, seemed content with silver, and didn’t really press the Dutch, who recorded their third Olympic record of the competition with 2:58.05. The bronze medal race was more exciting, with Japan taking an early lead. The Russians gained steam halfway through, and eventually won the bronze by a clear margin.
Ireen Wüst’s second gold medal of the Sochi Olympics made her the athlete with the highest number of medals in Sochi (5). She brought her all-time Olympic medal totals to 4 golds, 3 silvers and a bronze - a record for any Dutch Olympian.

It was no surprise that de Bruijn took an early lead in the final and at 50 metres she was ahead of her own world record split.

India, which had always competed since their debut in 1928, was eliminated by Great-Britain in one of the qualifying tournaments. Although the last medal of the 8-time Olympic champion had been back in 1980, their failure to qualify was considered an upset on the subcontinent.
India’s absence did not affect the list of favourites, which consisted of the traditional powerhouses Australia, Germany, Netherlands and Spain. Germany had won the last two World Cups, as well as the 2007 Champions Trophy. However, they had trouble qualifying at the European Championships. At that event, Belgium, which had not competed since 1976, took the bronze ahead of Germany, forcing the World Champions to one of the three Qualifying Tournaments. Of the other favorites, the Dutch team had won the 2007 Europeans, beating Spain, while defending Olympic champion Australia had lost the past two World Cup finals to the Germans.
The round robin stage went pretty much as expected, with the four favourites going through to the semi-finals. Both contests were close affairs. Germany only defeated the Netherlands after a penalty shootout, while Spain came back from 0-2 behind to dismiss Australia 3-2. The final was not as exciting, both teams playing defensively. A single penalty corner, scored by Christopher Zeller, gave Germany the decisive lead after 16 minutes. Germany’s title added a new chapter in the family history of the Kellers. Striker Florian Keller joined his grandfather, father, brother and sister as Olympic medallists.

The clear favorite was Vladimir Salnikov, World Champion in 1978, who would later win the 400 free in Moscow, and it was anticipated that the barrier was in trouble.

I was still flying the last 100 metres.” His next three 100s were all done in under a minute, but at 1400 he was tantalizingly outside the minute per 100 pace, going through in 14:00.22.

Far more important to the outcome of the medals was the lack of international competition since 2019 and the sheer luck of the draw. The top seeded Frenchman Sofiane Oumiha had the misfortune to be drawn against Keyshawn Davis for his first bout. Davis had seemingly given up on his Olympic ambitions by signing a contract to box professionally, but the COVID-19 pandemic gave him an unexpected reprieve.
Davis had won three pro bouts when it became apparent that both the Pan-American and final world qualifying events would not take place and Pan-American qualification for Tokyo would be via the world rankings. As the only American eligible via those rankings, Davis was asked to take the US Olympic team spot and performed well in Japan. After a win over Enrico Lacruz he took out Oumiha in the second round of their bout, then completed his rout of Europeans with wins over two other highly rated fighters in Gabil Mamedov and Hovhannes Bachkov.
Over on the other side of the draw something similar was happening via the fists of Cuban Andy Cruz. Ranked in a lowly position due to a lack of competition, the two-time world champion reached the final with three comfortable wins.
The gold medal bout was a throwback to the great Cuba-USA rivalries of the last quarter of the 20th century. Cruz and Davis shared the first two rounds so the title came down to the three final minutes. One of the judges believed Davis had done enough to win but the other four came down in favour of the Cuban fighter, which earned Cruz the gold medal.
The traditional award for the best boxer of the Games, the Val Barker Trophy, was not awarded in 2021 due to the AIBA not being involved in running the Olympic tournament, but Cruz won an award bearing the same name that was given out at the 2021 AIBA men’s World Championships later in the year.

The Soviet Union, the 1976 Olympic bronze medalists, sent four members from their reigning World Championship squad, Nina Cheremisina, Marina Studneva, Galina Sovetnikova, and Svetlana Semyonova (the fifth, Olha Pyvovarova, competed in the coxed eights in Moscow), augmented by Mariya Fadeyeva and Nataliya Kazak, the latter of whom substituted for Cheremisina in the opening round.

They were represented by their most recent bronze medal-winning crew: Georgeta Militaru, Florica Silaghi, Maria Tănasă, Valeria Cătescu, and Aneta Matei.
East Germany won its heat over the Soviet Union in the opening round, but more surprising was the Bulgarian victory in the other heat. Bulgaria had been the runners up at the 1976 Games, but had not since made an impact on the World Championships and only brought two of their silver medalists from Montreal, Ginka Gyurova and Mariyka Modeva, to Moscow. Nonetheless, the East Germans remained the superior power and took gold in an Olympic record time, leaving the Bulgarians and the Soviets to battle for silver. In the end, the host nation lost out by a margin of only 0.17 seconds, and settled for bronze. This meant that podium for this event at the 1980 Games was unchanged from the previous edition.

The opening heats were won by Hungary (whose lineup included Imre Szöllősi, a 1960 Olympic silver medalist in the K-1 1000 and the kayak relay 4 x 500 metres), Austria, and Romania, the latter of whom posted the round’s fastest time. In the semi-finals Hungary and Romania won their heats once again, but it was Norway who surprised the spectators by not only defeating the Austrians, but capturing their heat faster than anyone else. Demonstrating that this was not a fluke, the Norwegians battled both the Romanians and the Hungarians to the finish line in the final and took gold over the former by 0.43 seconds, setting an Olympic record in the process. Hungary, meanwhile, finished in a comfortable third 0.29 seconds after the Hungarians took silver, while Austria struggled and placed seventh. Norway’s gold medal was its first in Olympic canoeing, its first of any color in the sport since 1948, its last Olympic canoeing title until 1996, and its only victory at the 1968 Summer Olympics.

The qualifying round would have been considered a huge shock had it not been for the form shown by the rest of the British team at Rio, with the time sheets being topped by Becky James, returning after missing most of three years with a variety of illnesses and injuries, and the hugely inexperienced convert from athletics, Katy Marchant.The first three rounds passed uneventfully barring for Vogel’s ousting of Lee Wai Sze of Hong Kong who had qualified with a faster time trial than the German.
The first semi-final between James and Ligtlee went the Briton’s way but the chances of the women’s final mirroring the men’s event with an all British final ended when the greater tactical experience of Vogel proved too much for Marchant. Vogel outraced James in two-straight sprints to grab the gold medal despite suffering the ignominy of having her saddle collapse to the side of the track just before the finish line in the second heat of the final.

Spain’s Mario Mola was the in-form man going into Rio. He had won four of the seven World Series events in 2016, including the Hamburg race, the last before Rio. Alistair Brownlee had two World Series wins under his belt leading up to the Games and was confident of retaining his Olympic title.
However, after the opening swim in Rio, the first ever from a beach start in Olympic history, Slovakia’s Richard Varga held a two second lead over Igor Polyansky of Russia, while Polyansky’s brother Dmitry, third in the 2012 World Triathlon Series, was lying in fourth place. The fancied Brownlee brothers were well placed in sixth and ninth, with Jonny slightly ahead of his older sibling.
The contest was building into a close contest after the cycle ride. With transition time added at the end of the ride, six men started the final 10km run within two  seconds of each other with Varga, Jonny Brownlee, and France’s 2015 World Series bronze medalist  Vincent Luis all at 1h 13m 51s, just one second ahead of Alistair Brownlee, Marten Van Riel of Belgium and South Africa’s Henri Schoeman.
After the first lap of the 10km run, the Brownlees occupied the first two places with Luis third, but the Frenchman soon dropped back and finished seventh. The Brownlee brothers dominated the race after pulling away before the end of the first lap and in the end, Alistair beat Jonny by six seconds, while South Africa’s Henri Schoeman took the bronze medal, 42 seconds behind the winner, and seven seconds ahead of his compatriot Richard Murray (who nearly produced one of the greatest triathlon comebacks of all time when he came within a whisker of winning a medal despite going into the final leg nearly 90 seconds behind). For Schoeman, it was the first podium finish of his career and he had the distinction of being the first African triathlete to win an Olympic medal.
But the lasting memory of a magnificent men’s contest was the two British brothers lying side-by-side on the ground after crossing the finishing line congratulating each other as they improved on their 2012 performance of gold and bronze, which they had now upgraded to gold and silver, with Alistair becoming the first triathlete to win back-to-back Olympic golds.

In the first round he made an impressive 116.0 m jump, nine meters longer than his closest opponent, the winner from the Normal hill Jens Weißflog. Austrian Armin Kogler, the best ski jumper at the 1982 World Championships with one gold and one bronze, revenged himself after his poor showing in the Normal hill by lying third.
In the second round, Kogler, starting as number 6, took an early lead and kept his position until Jari Puikkonen, the bronze winner from the Normal hill, took over the lead with a decent jump of 102.0 m. Then the US representative Jeff Hastings, lying 12th after the first round, surprised with a jump of 107.0 m, and suddenly an American was in a position for a medal. But the 19-year old Czech Pavel Ploc, who in 1983 had set a new world record of 181.0 m in his home town Harrachov, answered with a jump of 109.0 m and took over the lead with Weißflog and Nykänen yet to come. Weißflog improved half a meter from his first jump and was now first, over ten points ahead of Ploc. Nykänen, with his big lead after the first jump, could now secure his first Olympic gold medal with a safe jump of around 100 m, but the young Finn was not the type to make safe jumps. He once again made the best and longest jump of the round, 111.0 m. His victory margin was an impressive 17.5 points, the biggest victory margin in the history of Olympic ski jumping. Jeff Hastings fourth place was the best American placing in ski jumping for 60 years, only beaten by Anders Haugen’s bronze medal from 1924. For the ski-jump-loving nation of Norway, the event was described as a national catastrophe. Norway’s best jumper ended in 18th place, the nation’s worst ever Olympic ski jumping performance.

Before World War II 8-metres were the most prestigious international yacht racing class, and they are still actively raced around the world.
The International Rules for the metre classes were written in October 1907. The “8” in the 8-metre class represents the product of a formula, not the length of the boat. The 8-metre boats are usually 15 metres long. The formula uses the values of boat length, beam, waterline length, skin girth and chain girth, freeboard and sail area. The result is a fixed number, which is then referred to as the ship class. The class identifier for the 8 m class was an underlined Eight “8”.
There were four races contested in 1932 between two boats, the American Angelita and the Canadian Santa Maria. There was no drama in this event at all as Angelita won all four races and the gold medal with the silver going to the Canadian crew. Six crewmen were on the boats for each race, but American skipper Owen Churchill made certain that his 12 crew members alternated in the races so that all received a gold medal.

The clear favorite in this event was Austrian organ builder Gregor Hradetzky. He had won the European title in this event in both 1933 and 1934. Runner-up at the latter championship was France’s Henri Eberhardt, also starting in Berlin. The third contender was assumed to be Germany’s entrant, national champion Xaver Hörmann. And indeed, the race turned out to be contested between these three paddlers. Hörmann took the early lead, before Hradetzky and Eberhardt took the initiative. With Hörmann following closely, these two exchanged leads. The race wasn’t decided until the final kilometre, when Hradetzky opened up a gap of a boat’s length, winning the race 3 seconds ahead of the Frenchman.
Hradetzky would win a second title the next day, in a different boat type (kayak) and in a sprint distance rather than a long distance, making him the outstanding canoeist of these Olympics. Henri Eberhardt would return to the Olympics in 1948, and claim a second Olympic medal in the 1,000 m K-1.

Behind Margaret Abbott in the women’s tournament came Polly Whittier and a lady listed in the past as Mrs. J. Huger Pratt of Dinard, France.  The three women were mysteries until research by Dr. Paula Welch, a sports historian at the University of Florida, unearthed their identities.
Margaret Abbott was born in Calcutta (Kolkata), India in 1876 to wealthy parents.  She learned her golf at the Chicago Golf Club but in 1900 was studying art in Paris, accompanied by her mother, who also played in the Olympic golf tournament (she finished seventh).  By winning the Olympic golf tournament she became the first American woman to win an Olympic event (and only the second overall).
Polly Whittier, often listed as being from Switzerland, was actually Pauline Whittier of Boston.  Also from a wealthy family, Whittier was a descendent of the famous poet, John Greenleaf Whittier, and in 1900 was studying in St. Moritz, hence the mistaken affiliation.
Mrs. J. Huger Pratt of Dinard was the former Daria Pankhurst.  Vacationing in France in 1900, she played her golf at the Dinard Club.  A short time after the Olympics, Daria Pratt’s second husband, Mr. Thomas Huger Pratt, died an early death.  She later married Prince Alexis Karageorgevitch of Serbia, thus becoming the Princess Karageorgevitch of Serbia.

Edoardo, together with brother Dario , made it easily to the final and went on to win his only individual Olympic gold of a 24-year, 13-medal career. Dario won a barrage for the silver medal to complete a rare sibling 1-2 whilst Oswald Zappelli of Switzerland repeated his bronze medal performance of 1952.  The unfortunate Léon Buck placed fourth as he had done as part of the Luxembourg team.
In the pools, if two or more fencers had the same number of victories and the tie had to be broken to determine which fencer(s) qualified for the next round or to determine the gold medalist in the final round, then barrage bouts were fenced to resolve the tie. In all other cases, ties were resolved by whichever fencers had the fewest number of touches received or, if there was a tie in touches received, then by the greatest number of touches given.

Unsurprisingly, Croatia, Romania, and Denmark moved through to the final, but Australia failed to make the grade, with Canada, Serbia, and Spain rounding out the field. As for the race itself, as expected, Croatia soon pulled out to the lead, and although the Romanians made a strong effort, they had to settle for the silver, with New Zealand narrowly edging Canada to win the bronze.

Steinbrenner, well-known as the owner of the New York Yankees, learned that his mother was concerned about how they would pay for Ron’s medical school, which he planned to start that fall, but Steinbrenner told them not to worry, and financed the schooling of the man he would later call “Doctor Ron.” Karnaugh later became a specialist in physical medicine and rehabilitation.

But by the mid-1970s they were no longer as strong a team. However, in 1979, the World Championship was won by Bob Niemann (USA) and the US won the team title by a very narrow seven-point margin. Because of the American-led boycott, he would not be able to compete, which left the individual event open. The defending champion, Poland’s Janusz Pyciak-Peciak was back and had been silver medalist at the Worlds in 1978-79. Also back was the 1976 Olympic silver medalist, Pavel Lednev, who had won his fourth World title in 1978. Lednev had wanted to retire after 1976, but was asked by Soviet authorities to continue. He was coming off an injury and had not competed in 1979.
The competition eventually came down to Lednev and his young teammate, Anatoly Starostin, and Hungary’s Tamás Szombathelyi. Szombathelyi led after the fencing and shooting, but Starostin moved into the lead after the 300 metre freestyle swim. Lednev was third after the shooting but a poor swim dropped him to seventh. Starostin held onto his lead with a solid cross-country run and won the gold medal. Szombathelyi placed second, while Lednev’s good run brought him a bronze medal. The run was held on a very hot day with temperatures of 31° C. (88 ° F.)
This was the fourth consecutive Olympics at which Lednev had medaled in the individual event – bronze in 1968, 1972, and 1980 and a silver in 1976. Added to this were three team medals, including two golds, giving him seven medals in all, the most ever by an Olympic pentathlete. Lednev followed in the footsteps of his former teammate, Igor Novikov. Together they had won eight World Championships in the individual event, but neither was ever able to garner an Olympic individual gold. Starostin’s gold medal was the first win ever for the Soviets in the individual competition. Starostin was still a junior and would win the Junior World Championship in 1981. In 1986 he was caught with a doping positive for a β-blocker, but would return to compete for the Unified Team in 1992.

She had been world-ranked #1 every year from 1972-79 and was an overwhelming favorite to win her third consecutive gold medal in Moskva. But it was not to be. She was never in contention for a medal, barely qualified for the final three throws, and eventually finished eighth. In round one, the lead was taken by María Colón (CUB), the 1979 Pan-American champion, with 68.40 (224-5). That mark would hold up for the gold medal.

Krumpholz broke the record set by Brad Cooper at the Australian Olympic Trials in February 1972. Cooper was favored, along with young American Rick DeMont, who had won the US Olympic Trials, and was competing in Munich in both the 400 and 1,500. Also highly considered was Steve Genter, silver medalist in the 200 free, who had recovered from a collapsed lung in Munich to win that silver.
In the final Cooper took the lead through 200 metres, followed by Genter and American Tom McBreen, with DeMont a body length back in fourth place. But by 300 metres DeMont had moved up to Cooper’s shoulder, and caught him just before the final turn. Over the last lap there was nothing to choose and it was unclear who had won the race, but the electric timers have it to DeMont by 1/100th of a second – 4:00.26 to 4:00.27.
Or so it seemed. Two days later, DeMont swam his preliminary round heat in the 1,500 and qualified for the final of that event. And then came the news that he had tested positive for a banned substance and was disqualified from the 400 freestyle, and the 1,500 metres. Unlike many athletes who test positive, DeMont did not deny that he had taken Marax the night before his 400 metre races, but the reason was that Rick DeMont was an asthmatic and he regularly took Marax, and ephedrine derivative, to help control wheezing. When he had an attack in the Olympic Village he took a pill between 0100 and 0200 and took another pill the next morning. DeMont never hid the fact that he took the drug on a regular basis for his asthma, and had noted this on his medical form required of US athletes, but the United States’ team doctors had never checked to see if it contained any banned substances. Despite protests by United States officials, Rick DeMont was disqualified and Brad Cooper declared the winner of the 400 freestyle. When told of the final decision in Munich, Cooper said, “I don’t want the medal.”
In 1996 DeMont sued the United States Olympic Committee (USOC) for having mishandled his situation in Munich. Among other things, it was alleged that the IOC offered to exonerate DeMont and led him keep the gold medal if the USOC would have the US team doctors accept responsibility for the error, but the USOC refused. In 2001 the USOC finally accepted responsibility and asked the IOC to restore DeMont’s gold medal but the IOC would not do so.
In 1973 Rick DeMont went to Belgrade, Yugoslavia for the 1st World Aquatics Championships. In the final of the 400 metre freestyle, he defeated Brad Cooper, breaking the world record and becoming the first swimmer to better four minutes for the 400 free, recording 3:58.18. He also won silver there in the 1,500. DeMont later became a swim coach at the University of Arizona and an accomplished artist.
Brad Cooper had a superb career, which has been marred by the controversy surrounding his Munich 400 gold medal. He won 18 Australian Championships, and at the 1972 World Aquatics Championships won silver behind DeMont in the 400 and a bronze in the 1,500. He competed in the 1974 Commonwealth Games, winning a gold in the 200 backstroke, silver in the 400 free, and a bronze in the 100 back, and then retired.
Steve Genter swam in Munich despite suffering collapsed lungs on first arriving in Germany and spending several days in the hospital, where he had to have thorax drained of fluid and air. He had already won silver in the 200 free and gold in the 4x200 relay by the time the 400 metre freestyle started. He finished third in the original race, and technically is listed as a silver medalist in the event, after the disqualification of DeMont. However, Genter thought that disqualification was unjust and never returned his bronze medal nor accepted a silver medal for the 400 metre freestyle.

In 2015, however, the IOC began re-testing samples from the 2008 Beijing and 2012 London Olympics, using newer, more advanced testing techniques, in an effort to find those who had used performance enhancing drugs (PEDs), but in whom it could not be detected at the time of those Olympics. This was one of the many events affected. Of note, every women’s weightlifting event from the 2008 Beijing Olympics was affected by positive re-tests for PEDs.
In October 2016 Anastasiya Novikova (BLR) had a re-test positive for turinabol (dehydrochloromethyltestosterone) and stanozolol. She was disqualified and lost her bronze medal, which was re-assigned to Indonesian Raema Lisa Rumbewas.

The defending Olympic champion nation of Denmark had not had a podium finish at a major international tournament since their 1964 victory, although members of its Roforeningen Kvik (none of whom were present in this event in Mexico City) had won the Stewards’ Challenge Cup at the Henley Royal Regatta in 1965. Perhaps the only serious challengers that the East Germans faced were the Hungarians, who sent their 1967 European runner-up crew, Zoltán Melis, György Sarlós, József Csermely, Antal Melis, to take another stab at a gold medal.
East Germany won its opening heat, although the fastest time of the round went to Hungary, and then Italy, who were participating in a somewhat more competitive heat. In the final, however, the East Germans were never in any real danger and captured the gold medal by a margin of over two and a half seconds. They would become known as “The Dresden Four” and never lost an international race together, including at the 1972 Summer Olympics. The Hungarians, in turn, took silver by finishing well ahead of the Italians, who settled for bronze. It was the first rowing medal for Hungary since 1948, its third ever, and, as of 2012, its most recent.

However, his abilities as a cross-country skier were rather modest, ending last in the cross-country event and placing 13th in the final classification. The great surprise of the event was another 19-year old, the East German Ulrich Wehling, placing fourth in the jumping event. To win, he had to beat his closest rival, the 22-year old Finn Rauno Miettinen by approximately one minute in the cross-country, and the young and unmerited German skied well, achieving the third fastest time of the day and beating Miettinen by almost two minutes. His team-mate Karl-Heinz Luck was fastest in the cross-country and advanced from 17th place in the jumping event to a bronze medal in the final classification.

With the team’s victory, Bjørndalen collected his 13th Olympic medal, setting a new Winter Olympic record for the most medals ever won, surpassing his former teammate, cross-country skiier Bjørn Dæhlie. Norway was almost perfect in its shooting, as only Berger, on the opening leg, missed any shots, and with her extra shots, she cleaned up those misses. Eckhoff dropped back to second on her leg, as the Czech Republic’s Gabriela Soukalová put her team ahead, but Bjørndalen gave Norway a lead they never relinquished, as he handed Svendsen a 43.1 second margin for his anchor leg, which became an effective victory lap. The Czech Republic held on for second with Italy taking a surprising bronze medal.
Germany, who originally placed fourth, was disqualified after Evi Sachenbacher-Stehle failed a drug test. On 1 December 2017 Olga Zaytseva and Olga Vilukhina were disqualified after findings of the Oswald Commission into Russian doping at Sochi 2014. Both appealed their disqualification. Zaytseva’s disqualification was upheld, while Vilukhina was reinstated. However, because of Zaytseva’s disqualification, the Russian team was disqualified. They had originally placed fifth before the disqualification of Germany, and had moved up to fourth, so no medals were affected by any of the drug rulings in this event.

His main worry for the final was the possibility of collusion between his two American team-mates, the Kahanamoku brothers Duke and Sam, to impede his progress. These worries had no foundation as the Hawaiians were more interested in seeing an American sweep of the medals than in any foul play. Although Weissmuller finished well outside his own world record, his winning margin of nearly two and a half seconds has never since been approached. The American’s victory was greeted by sustained cheering by the Parisian spectators and was one of the most popular of the entire games. Weissmuller had little time to savour his victory as he was due to play in the final of the third-place tournament for the US water polo team that same afternoon.

Clark had retired but Mills was back, now joined by Eilidh McIntyre, whose father, Mike McIntyre, had won gold in the Star class at Seoul in 1988. Mills and McIntyre had won the World Championships in 2019 and were silver medallists in 2017.
Other recent World Champions were Spain’s Silvia Mas and Patricia Cantero (2020); Poland’s Agnieszka Skrzypulec and Irmina Mrózek-Gliszczyńska (2017); and Japan’s hometown favorites of Ai Kondo Yoshida and Miho Yoshioka (2018). Poland was present at Tokyo but with Skrzypulec racing alongside Jolanta Ogar, who replaced Mrózek-Gliszczyńska, but who had sailed at London in 2012 with Skrzypulec.
Poland won the first two races and moved into the lead but Britain took race four to move up to second. Poland won race six and Mills/McIntyre won race seven and the two were virtually tied at that point. The Brits moved into the lead after race eight, and Poland dropped back to third going into the medal race, as they struggled in races nine and ten, and France’s Camille Lecointre and Aloïse Retornaz took over second.
None of the leaders featured in the medal race as Poland finished fourth, Great Britain fifth, and France sixth, but this was enough for Poland to leapfrog the French crew and move back up to the silver medal. France protested the medal race finish, claiming that Great Britain deliberately went wide around the last mark to allow Israel and Poland to move ahead of the French boat, but the protest was not upheld.
Great Britain’s gold medal meant the third medal in the event for Hannah Mills, who defended her Rio gold, after having won silver at London. In the silver medal position Retornaz was an Olympic debutante, but Lecointre repeated her bronze medal in this event from Rio, then racing with Hélène Defrance.

She was fired soon and picked up the sport again 7 months before the Games. Meanwhile, her rivals had continued normally. China’s Zhang Yanmei improved the World Record during the 1993 World Championships in Beijing, although the distance was eventually won by the overall World Champion, Nathalie Lambert.
Turner already had a reputation for being an aggressive skater - “competitive” in her own words - and she displayed this again at the Lillehammer Games. In the quarter-finals, Turner bumped several times into Lambert, sending her into the boards and out of contention. While Lambert named Turner “the dirtiest woman on skates”, the American continued unabashedly. She survived a fall in the semis (for which Isabelle Charest was disqualified), and made it into the final. Zhang led the decider with two laps to go, when Turner made a move to pass her. In doing so, she clearly touched the Chinese woman, who claimed Turner had grabbed her. But the referees had not seen anything, and the result was allowed to stand, much to the chagrin of Zhang. Already angered by their disqualification during the relay, she stomped away from the victory ceremony as soon as the U.S. national anthem had finished, throwing away her flowers in anger.
The IOC was not pleased with Zhang’s display, for which the Chinese later apologized. However, most of the other skaters seemed to agree with Zhang, as a Belgian proposal to allow referees to see television replays at the upcoming World Championships was quickly signed by all team leaders, except for the Americans. Some opponents took it even further, sending Turner hate mail through the Olympic Village messaging system.

Germany and Great Britain used their best women first and led after the opening leg but soon they faded and, with strong performances from the second and third swimmers, the Netherlands handed a healthy lead onto their anchor leg swimmer, Marleen Veldhuis.

Simply open one of the various books on the Olympics, and many of them will list the gold medalists, many the medalists, and a few give deeper placings.  Rarely is there a problem.  The results of the 1960 Olympic 100 metre freestyle swim are always given as listed below. But there’s often a lot behind those statistics.  In this case, the above result ranks with the 1972 Olympic basketball final and the 1908 400 metre run as one of the most controversial Olympic finishes ever.
In the summer of 1960, the favorite for this event was Jeff Farrell of the United States.  However, six days before the U.S. Olympic Trials, Jeff Farrell had to undergo an emergency appendectomy.  He was barely able to compete at the Trials and bravely held on to finish fourth, but that only earned him a relay spot at the Olympics.  Jon Henricks was the defending champion and was another contender but he also fell prey to illness as intestinal problems hampered him once he got to Rome, and he was eliminated in the semi-finals.
This left the favorite’s role to John Devitt, who, even with Farrell in the race, would have been a strong contender.  Devitt was born in Sydney and began swimming internationally in the early 1950’s.  He competed at the 1956 Melbourne Olympics, winning a silver medal in the 100 freestyle behind Jon Henricks and he won a gold member as a member of Australia’s 4 x 200 metre freestyle relay team.  Beginning in January 1957, he set three world records in the 100 metres and 110 yard freestyle.  He won three consecutive Australian titles, replacing Henricks as Australia’s top sprint swimmer (Henricks had won four consecutive Australian titles - 1953-56).  In 1959, John Konrads handed Devitt his first defeat in over two years, but he was thought to be a stronger distance swimmer.  Devitt had also been Commonwealth Games champion at 100 metres in 1958.
Lance Larson was not highly considered for the freestyle prior to the Olympic Trials.  His previous best event had been the butterfly.  He was the first man to break one minute in the 100 metre butterfly which he accomplished in June 1960 with a time of 59.0 seconds.  Larson had attended Southern Cal and was a superb all-around swimmer.  At various times he was an AAU champion in the freestyle, the butterfly, and the individual medley.  He was primarily a sprinter, however, and in 1960 the only butterfly event on the schedule was the 200 metre butterfly.  Larson competed at the Olympic Trials in the 200 butterfly but failed to make the team, finishing fourth.  In the 100 metre freestyle, however, he won the Trials.  Speaking years later, he has admitted that it is unlikely he could have beaten a healthy Jeff Farrell.
At Rome, the heats of the 100 freestyle were uneventful, as Larson, Devitt, Henricks, and Manuel dos Santos (BRA) all won their heats.  The semi-finals were marked only by Jon Henricks failing to qualify, with the three heats being won by Devitt, Dos Santos, and Larson.  Larson had the fastest semi-final time of 55.5, with Devitt posting a 55.8, both far from Devitt’s world record of 54.6.
The finals were held on Friday, 26 August, at 9:10 (2110) at night.  Dos Santos started the fastest and led at 50 metres, with Devitt and Larson equal second at the turn.  Dos Santos faded over the last 50 metres and Devitt came on with a rush.  Larson also closed, but more slowly, catching Devitt again at about 80 metres.  It appeared to most observers that Larson barely out-touched Devitt, although the result was very close.  Before getting out of the pool, Devitt congratulated Lance Larson.
The 1960 Olympics were held in the days prior to automatic starting pistols, automatic touch pads, and electronic timing.  There was an electronic timer at Rome, but it was used as a back-up system only.  Results in 1960 were decided by finish judges who relied on their eyes and did not use replays.  There were three first-place judges and three second-place judges.  Of the three first-place judges, they were split, 2-1, favoring Devitt.  The three second-place judges also favored Devitt for second, by 2-1.  Therefore, the six judges were split, 3-3, in terms of who won.
There were three official timers in 1960 for each lane and swimmer, all timing by hand.  All three timers for Devitt, in lane three, timed him in 55.2 seconds.  The three timers for lane four, had timed Larson in 55.0, 55.1, and 55.1 seconds; thus timing seemed to favor Larson.  The judges then turned to the electronic back-up timer to break the tie.  The electronic timing had Larson in 55.10 seconds and Devitt in 55.16 seconds, a difference of about 4 inches.  Using both the hand times and the electronic times, Larson’s time should have been listed as 55.1 seconds, with Devitt at 55.2.
After a long delay, the chief judge, Henry Runströmer of Sweden cast the deciding vote and declared Devitt the winner.  He ruled that Larson would be given the time of 55.2 seconds.  However, the rules at that time did not provide for the chief judge to have a vote or give him the right to break ties.  Ties were supposed to be broken by referring to the timing machine.  The United States’ team appealed.  The appeal jury, headed by Jan de Vries (NED), also the President of the Fédération Internationale de Natation (FINA) in 1960, rejected the appeal, keeping Devitt the winner.
Max Ritter was Treasurer of the U.S. Olympic Committee in 1960, and was also a member of the Executive Committee of FINA.  There was also one Australian member on the FINA Executive Committee.  Ritter took the protest at Rome to FINA, again headed by Jan de Vries, and again it was rebuffed by the Executive Committee by a vote of 5-3.  After the Rome Olympics, the protests did not end.  Max Ritter took it as his personal mission to see that Lance Larson received the gold medal Ritter thought he had earned.  Over the next four years, he continued to file official protests, first with the entire membership of FINA, and finally with the International Olympic Committee.  They were all rejected.  The result stood.  Thus John Devitt was declared the champion and received a gold medal at Rome, while Lance Larson received a silver medal.  They were declared co-holders of the Olympic record in 55.2 seconds, a time Larson assuredly had bettered.
Ritter mainly blamed Bertil Sällfors of Sweden for the result, who was the secretary-general of FINA in 1960.  In an article in Amateur Athlete, Ritter wrote, “This whole sorry mess can be attributed to the incompetence of the then secretary of FINA, Bertil Sällfors of Sweden.  As a FINA secretary of long-standing, he should have known that in the FINA swimming competitions, such as the Olympic Games, no vote is ever bestowed upon the chief judge (when there is controversy).  Sällfors argued that in Sweden, they give the chief judge a vote; however, Olympic Games in Rome are different from competitions in Sweden.  If Sällfors would have followed regular FINA procedure and would not have given the chief judge a vote, we could have registered a clear-cut result, such as always is the endeavour in international competition.”
In some of his writings about the protest, Ritter noted, “When I questioned the chief judge how he came to vote for Devitt as the winner, he stated that he stood at the finish line and saw clearly that Devitt outtouched Larson at the finish.”  However, a photograph of the finish in Sports Illustrated incriminates Runströmer’s ability to accurately judge the finish.  First of all, he was opposite lane 8, five and six lanes from Devitt and Larson.  Secondly, he is five yards away from the finish line, so he was not looking down at the touch pads directly, but only at an angle from 25 yards away.
Relay races at Rome helped bring some justice to the story.  Lance Larson did not swim on the 4 x 200 metre freestyle relay team for the U.S., which won a gold medal, but he swam the butterfly leg for the medley relay, thus earning his gold medal in that event.  Devitt did swim in the 4 x 200 relay, helping Australia to a bronze medal.
John Devitt was a great swimmer whose career has been somewhat tainted by all the controversy surrounding his Olympic victory.  His Olympic record includes two gold, one silver, and one bronze medal.  He won three gold medals at the 1958 Commonwealth Games, broke 14 world records (4 individual, 10 team), and won 13 Australian championships (3 individual and 10 team).  Devitt thinks he won the race.  He feels that the timekeepers had a poor view of the finish and missed his underwater touch.  “I started to take another stroke with my left hand, but I was so close to the wall that I reached out more with my right while it was under water and I think it was not seen,” Devitt stated in later years.  He retired from swimming after the Rome Olympics.
Lance Larson attended dental school after the Olympics, and also retired from international competition.  But in the mid-1970’s he began swimming competitively again in Masters’ competition and has become a multiple record setter and champion in that field.  He has become rather philosophical about the controversy.  “We all compete, to some degree, looking for recognition and a measure of fame.  The one good thing about the decision is that it has kept my name in the public eye longer than it would have if I had been declared the champion,”  Larson commented.  He also feels he won the race.  “I think John has had to live with the feeling for many years that he probably didn’t really win that gold medal.”  Larson and Devitt met again for the first time more than 20 years after the race and got on very well, by Larson’s reports.
The result of the controversy was that FINA decided that electronic timing was a necessity to avoid such problems in the future.  Since the 1968 Olympics, all international swim races have been timed electronically.  But the result still reads: Rome - 1960 - 100 metre freestyle: 1. Devitt 55.2, 2. Larson 55.2.  There’s often a lot behind those lines.

Gary Ilman pulled well ahead on the third leg, and Germany moved up to pass the Japanese for second.

The rules in force were those of the United States, rather than Britain.  The jury had a difficult time deciding who was putting the shot and who was throwing it, the primary offender apparently being the Finn, Verner Järvinen, who was favored in Rose/Horgan’s absence, but had no fair efforts.  In the absence of the world’s top putters, Martin Sheridan won the event, but his mark was mediocre.  Either Rose or Horgan would have surpassed it easily.

China, meanwhile, was represented by the only crew to have defeated the Germans at the World Championships: Cao Mianying, Zhang Xiuyun, Liu Xirong, and Gu Xiaoli. Reigning Pan American champion Canada sent its 1995 World runner-up squad of Laryssa Biesenthal, Diane O’Grady, Marnie McBean, and Kathleen Heddle, the latter two of whom were 1992 Olympic champions in the coxless pairs and the coxed eights and captured a third Olympic title in the double sculls in Atlanta.
The opening heats were won by Canada and Germany, the latter of whom posted the fastest time of the round. The Germans dominated the final, winning gold by a margin of nearly three seconds, but the interesting part of the race came as the Ukrainians and the Canadians went neck and neck to the finish line and seemed to cross at the same time. A photo finish revealed that the Ukrainians had taken silver, but just barely, as the margin was only 0.02 seconds. The Canadians captured bronze, but not particularly comfortably, as the Danes had been only about half a second behind. The Ukrainian crew boasted Svitlana Maziy and Inna Frolova, runners-up from the 1988 edition of the event at the Olympics, as well as Dina Miftakhutdynova and Olena Ronzhyna, who were bronze medalists at the 1994 World Championships with Maziy, and won their country its first Olympic rowing medal as an independent nation.

He seemed to be the strongest competitor going into the event but, in a race as unpredictable as the C-1 200, all three podium spots were up for grabs. His greatest rival was Russia’s Ivan Shtyl, who could claim the 2010 edition of this event among his six World Championship titles. Lithuanian Jevgenijus Šuklinas was another medal favorite, having won the European Championships in 2007 and 2010.
In perhaps the most shocking result in canoeing at the 2012 Games, Demyanenko became the only one of the 25 canoeists eliminated in the heats of the C-1 200. Despite four other paddlers posting slower times, Demyanenko was in the only heat of seven participants in a qualification round where the top six would advance, and he finished last. With rookie Alfonso Benavides of Spain posting the fastest time, the race was assured to be the exciting spectacle that the officials had hoped for when adding the 200 metre events to the Olympic program. Nonetheless, Shtyl emerged as the new favorite by having the quickest finish in the semi-finals, but still less than three-tenths of a second faster than Benavides. In the final, however, it was Ukraine’s Yuriy Cheban who set the pace, bolting out of the start and, like the earlier men’s K-1 200 final, never being seriously challenged. Cheban, the 2007 World Champion in the event, won gold in his third Olympic appearance; he had competed in the C-1 500 and 1000 in 2004 and 2008 and had earned a bronze medal in the former discipline in Beijing. Šuklin paddled a strong race and earned silver, with Shtyl finding a late burst of energy to shut out Benavides for the bronze.
In June 2019, Šuklinas was disqualified after a doping re-test revealed the presence of dehydrochloromethyltestosterone (Turinabol) metabolites in his urine sample. In November 2021 the IOC Media made an announcement advancing Shytl to silver and Benavides to bronze.

Another American, McRae Williams, was the 2017 World Champion and Winter X Games runner-up. Among non-Americans, Sweden’s Henrik Harlaut was the most recent Winter X Games champion and Fabian Bösch of Switzerland was the 2015 World Champion; both were challengers for podium spots.
The competition in this event at the 2018 Games was fierce, with eight of the qualifiers posting best scores of over 90 points in the opening round. They were led by Oscar Wester of Sweden, a veteran skier, but one without any major titles to his name. In an additional shocking twist, Williams, Harlaut, and Bösch were all eliminated with mediocre runs. The surprise in the final, meanwhile, came from Norway’s Øystein Bråten, who was the 2017 Winter X Games Champion and the 2018 runner-up. Bråten posted a score of 95.00 on his first run, which was far ahead of the field at that time and was never surpassed, earning him the gold medal.

Beaulieu-Marchand had taken bronze at the 2017 Winter X Games, while Woods had done the same at that year’s World Championships. In the final round, however, Goepper came back from two mediocre runs and scored an impressive 93.60, enough to secure silver and leave Beaulieu-Marchand with bronze. Wester crashed twice and left with only a mediocre score while Kenworthy, hampered by recent injuries, was unable to perform to the best of his ability and placed last.

At World Championships, the format was introduced in 2018, and in all four finals France faced Japan with Japan winning the title at every occasion. Based on the results of the individual events, this seemed to be the logical outcome also at the Olympics. So far, Japan won nine gold and one bronze and France one gold, three silver and three bronze, of which only two bronze came from the men’s events.
Both teams were spared from the elimination round, just like the teams of the Russian Olympic Committee and Brazil, two potential contenders for bronze. In the quarter-final, Japan, calling up six gold medallists, defeated Germany 4-2, but only after being behind 0-2. France also had a hard time beating Israel 4-3, when the extra fight had to be decided by Golden Score. While the Russian victory over Mongolia did not come unexpectedly, the Netherlands scored a 4-2 upset over Brazil, bronze medallist at the last two World Championships. Brazil was finally eliminated in the repêchage by Israel. Germany made the bronze medal contest by defeating Mongolia.
In the semi-finals, Japan and France scored one-sided 4-0 wins against the ROC and the Netherlands, respectively, without having to go into extra-time in any of the matches. The bronze medals were eventually taken by the dark horse Israel and Germany. In the final, four gold medallists represented Japan: Shohei Ono, Chizuru Arai, Akira Sone, and Aaron Wolf, and they were complemented by bronze medallist Tsukasa Yoshida and ninth placed Shoichiro Mukai. The French team consisted of Clarisse Agbegnenou (silver), Sarah-Léonie Cysique (silver), Romane Dicko and Teddy Riner (both bronze), and non-medallists Axel Clerget, and Guillaume Chaine. Agbegnenou moved up one category and collected two Waza-aris (half points) to defeat the Japanese gold medallist Arai. Clerget threw Mukai by Sumi-otoshi (corner drop) in extra-time for a 2-0 lead. Sone, who already won gold on the day before, outscored Dicko by two Waza-ari to revive Japan’s hopes. French heavyweight legend Teddy Riner then scored a Waza-ari for the Golden Score in the clash of gold medallists defeating half-heavyweight Wolf to give France a comfortable lead. Sarah-Léonie Cysique held on to an early lead by Waza-ari against Yoshida to earn France the fourth point and, hence, the gold medal. Despite leaving Japan in disappointment, the new event was considered a successful addition to the judo program.

It is somewhat similar to trap shooting as the shooters used a shotgun to fire at clay discs. But in skeet, the rifle is held at the hip, or mid-torso, until the target is fired and the birds are thrown from two towers above the ground, while trap discs are launched from ground level. In skeet, there is also a variable delay for the discs to be launched after they are called.
Most of the shooters used the Browning over-and-under shotgun, with the German Rottweil the most popular ammunition. At the 1967 World Championships, Germany’s Konrad Wirnhier was the champion, with Soviets Yury Tsuranov and Yevgeny Petrov placing second and third, respectively.
