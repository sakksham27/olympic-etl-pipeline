Much of the USA team in 1983 would stay together to compete at the 1984 Olympics.  They were led by the greatest ever women’s basketball coach, Pat Head (later Summitt), who had played on the USA team at the 1976 Olympics.  With the Olympics in Los Angeles, it appeared that the United States might finally bring down the Soviet women’s team.
But the Soviet-led boycott, announced in early 1984, meant the two teams would not compete again for a second consecutive Olympiad.  With the boycott, the field was again restricted to six teams – the USA, Korea, China, Canada, Australia, and Yugoslavia.  The United States was led by Cheryl Miller, considered the greatest woman player to that time, and the sister of future NBA star, Reggie Miller.  Nobody pressed the American team, which won the final over Korea, 85-55, its closest game in the tournament.

The 30-year-old soldier from CSKA Kirov was World Champion in 1959, 1962 and 1963, and at the same championships he also was member of the Soviet Union team winning the team competition. His team-mate Aleksandr Privalov was also considered among the favorites, winning the bronze medal in the 1960 Games and coming second in the World Championships 1961. The greatest threats to the Soviets were considered to be the Finns. Antti Tyrväinen had a habit of coming second in international championships, with silver medals both from the 1960 games and from the World Championships 1962 and 1963. The Finnish team also consisted of two interesting veterans. Hannu Posti, aged 38 and placing fourth in 5000 m track at the 1952 Helsinki Games, had taken up biathlon with success, placing third at the 1963 World Championships. Another interesting start was triple Olympic Gold medalist in cross country skiing, Veikko Hakulinen. Now a veteran of 39, he was considered the fastest skier among the biathletes, and had a silver medal as a member of the Finnish team at the team competition in the World Biathlon Championships 1963.
After the first shooting Vilmoş Gheorghe, a 23-year old Romanian representing Dinamo Braşov, was in the lead, closely followed by Valentin Pshenitsyn, and with favorites Melanin and Tyrväinen close behind. At the second shooting Gheorghe had one missed target and received a 2 minutes penalty, and Melanin was in a clear lead, 1:10 ahead of Pshenitsyn. After the third shooting Melanin was still in the lead, now with Pshenitsyn only 36 seconds behind. The 24-year old Norwegian Olav Jordet had advanced to third, the Swede John Güttke was fourth and Privalov fifth, all with no missed targets. At the final standing shooting, only Melanin among the top medal contenders was reported to have a full house. It was the first time that Melanin achieved 20 hits in a major competition. Privalov and Jordet were reported with one missed target, and the preliminary list showed a clear gold medal for Melanin, silver for Jordet and bronze for Privalov.
In those days the hits was not automatically registered, and the targets had to be taken down after the competition for a manual control. In the final control of the targets Privalov’s miss was changed to a hit, and he was advanced to the silver medal position ahead of Jordet. The Norwegian Ragnar Tveiten with the second fastest cross country time of the competition and preliminary placed eight with eight penalty minutes, had one of his missed targets changed to a hit and advanced to fourth position in the official results. Hakulinen was the fastest skier of the day, but with twelve penalty minutes he ended up as fifteenth in the final standings.

Sasahara then won the gold medal with a victory by decision over Mewis.
Sasahara never competed at another Olympics but would later serve as vice-president of FILA, the international wrestling federation, and the Japanese Olympic Committee, and as mayor of the Olympic Village at the 1998 Olympic Winter Games in Nagano. Mewis was competing in his second Olympics, after Helsinki, and would also compete in 1960 and 1964, but this was his only Olympic medal.

But he had yet to win an individual Olympic gold medal, placing second in 1968 after being favored. He was not favored in 1972, that distinction going to the Soviet World Champion (1971) Boris Onishchenko. After four phases, Balczó was tied for third with the defending gold medalist Björn Ferm (SWE), both trailing Onishchenko and his teammate, Pavel Lednev. But Balczó was a far superior runner and finished third in the cross-country run, pulling him ahead of both Soviets to an easy overall victory. Onishchenko won the silver and Lednev the bronze medal. This was Balczó’s third gold medal, adding it to team golds in 1960 and 1968, still the most ever by an Olympic modern pentathlete – thru 2008. The gold, and the team silver in 1972, gave him five Olympic medals, an Olympic record at the time. Balczó later married 1972 Olympic gymnast Mónika Császár. They would have 11 children and he would become an extreme right-wing politician.
During the competition it was discovered that 14 athletes had taken sedatives (Valium and Librium) before the shooting phase. The drugs were not banned by the International Olympic Committee (IOC), although they were by the Union Internationale de Pentathlon Moderne (UIPM). But at the Olympics, the IOC rules were followed, so the athletes were not disqualified.

They had amongst their ranks, Shi Tingmao, the 2015 World Champion and FINA World Female Diver of the Year, and she was clearly one of the favourites to win gold in the 3-metre event at the Maria Lenk Aquatics Centre. Her impressive list of results in 2015 also saw her win the individual 3-metre gold at all four World Series events. She came into the Rio Games with two gold medals to her name from the 2016 FINA World Cup and was also the individual 3-metre winner in the Beijing and Dubai World Series events. The 2015 World Championship runner-up He Zi also of China, and bronze medalist, Italy’s Tania Cagnotto, were expected to finish behind Tingmao for the other two medals.
On the first day of the qualifiers, the pool was closed for practice whilst officials tried to get the water back to its original blue colour from the murky green it had become. The qualifying went ahead with assurances that the change of colour would pose no health risks to the competitors and Canada’s Jennifer Abel topped the first group of qualifiers ahead of some high-class divers including Zi, Tingmao and Cagnotto. Spare a thought for Nadezhda Bazhina of Russia as she slipped attempting her fourth dive and landed in the water on her back, and was awarded no points
The semi-final round reduced the field to the 12 finalists and this time Tingmao topped the list of qualifiers nearly a full 21 points ahead of Zi and more than 60 points clear of Jennifer Abel as another China one-two looked on the cards. The Chinese divers were the last two to dive in the opening round of the final; in the lead at that point were Cagnotto and Abel jointly on 76.50. That all changed after Zi went and scored 81.00 but, with the last dive of the round, Tingmao matched her team-mate’s score and they jointly held first place. That was the same after round two when, again, they both scored 81.00 with Cagnotto moving into third place on her own, but a long way behind the two Chinese divers. The Italian consolidated her third place in round three while Tingmao pulled away from Zi with 84.00 to 74.40. By now it was obvious that China would take gold and silver, but the battle for bronze heated up with the fourth round dives. Cagnotto had a disaster scoring just 69.00 while Abel moved back into third with a 79.90, and Tingmao pulled away even further in the race to gold.
After her disastrous fourth dive, an 81.00 put Cagnotto back into third after her final dive and Abel knew that 74.60 or better would give her the bronze medal, but she finished off with a poor dive and she scored just 69. Meanwhile, Tingmao wound up proceedings with her third 81.00 of the competition and ended up the victor by 18.15 points, adding the individual gold to the synchronised one she won seven days earlier. For Zi, there was one final moment of sheer joy in store. Shortly after being presented with her silver medal, her boyfriend Qin Kai, a synchronised springboard bronze medallist a few days earlier, proposed to Zi in front a global audience of billions – fortunately she said “Yes”.

the 4 x 100 metres freestyle relay epitomized the Sydney Olympic Games to the people of Australia.
This was an epic struggle between the best swimming nations in the world and, at least for the home nation, ended in a victory of epic proportions. The background to the race was fairly clear – the US always wins this race at the Olympic Games but this time Australia had a quartet of high quality and their most recent, at the 1999 Pan-Pacific Championships, had resulted in a rare win for the Aussies.
Before the Games things even got a bit personal between the two teams as the USA’s Gary Hall, Jr.  predicted that his team would “Smash the Aussies like guitars”.
In the final Michael Klim got the Australians off to the best possible start by breaking the world record for the 100 metres freestyle on the opening flag. The second and third legs followed the same pattern as the USA chased down Australia and took the lead only to lose that lead before the changeover. The big guns took to the pool on the anchor leg with Hall facing Ian Thorpe to resolve the dispute. Once again American started quickly and pulled out a gap on his rival but Thorpe was relentless in the chase and, with the crowd whipped up into frenzy, took the lead with five strokes left and held on record a memorable victory. Needless to say both teams smashed the existing world record. In celebration and noting Hall’s comment, Michael Klim played air guitar to the Australian fans.

Nyjah Huston of the USA, the four-time World Champion, was considered a long-range favourite for gold but he suffered a setback before the Olympics when beaten to the world title in June by Japan’s Yuto Horigome. Huston qualified well but could only successfully land one of his five tricks, which put him out of contention.
In contrast, Horigome’s scores were entirely reliant on his single tricks. Of the nine scores above nine points, the Japanese star scored four of them to clinch the inaugural Olympic skateboard title. Kelvin Hoefler of Brazil and Jagger Eaton of the USA performed consistently throughout the final to win silver and bronze.

Swiss pilot Françoise Burdet won the 2001 version of the World Champion but her victory was somewhat of a surprise as the 1999-2000 and 2000-01 World Cup seasons had been dominated by the American pairing of Jean Racine  and Jen Davidson. Racine and Davidson’s performances dipped at the beginning of the Olympic season and, despite having previously described as her best friend, the decision was made to replace Davidson with novice brakewoman Gea Johnson. Johnson herself was a controversial figure having served a suspension for steroid abuse while competing in track and field as a heptathlete and had only six months experience as a bobsledder. Whilst the form of the top American sled had dipped the German teams had advanced to the top of the world rankings. Former Olympic luge medalist Suzi Erdmann  had converted to bobsledding since the Nagano Games and topped the World Cup standings ahead of compatriot Sandra Prokoff.
Unlike the men’s event the inaugural women’s Olympic title was decided over two runs contested on a single day. The sensation of the first run was the performance of the USA II sled of pilot Jill Bakken  and brakewoman Vonetta Flowers. In a similar situation to the USA I sled Flowers had come into the team at late notice, replacing Bakken’s regular partner Shauna Rohbock, and her background in sprinting was put to good use as the team recorded impressive start times.  USA II actually lengthened their winning margin slightly with their second run impressive and were a third of a second clear of the first of two successive German crews. This was the first Olympic victory by the United States since the 1948 Games. The gamble made by the top American crew to include Gea Johnson failed disastrously as she suffered a hamstring injury and USA I could not finish higher than fifth.
The performance of the Dutch team in sixth was their nation’s best ever Winter Olympic finish outside the various disciplines of skating.
A feature of the first Olympic bobsleigh competition was the appearance of athletes who had been drafted in from other sports. The Italian pairing of Gerda Weissensteiner  and Antonella Bellutti were both former Olympic champions. Weissensteiner had won the women’s luge in Albertville whilst Bellutti’s titles came in track cycling at Atlanta and Sydney. One former Olympic champion was barred from competing. Atlanta 100 m hurdles champion Ludmila Engquist  had been a part of the Swedish team on the World Cup circuit but registered a positive drug test shortly before the Games.
In hindsight perhaps the most important feature of this event was the sight of African-American Vonetta Flowers on the top step of the Olympic podium. Flowers was the first black champion in the 78 year history of the Winter Games.

Led by Brigadier Charles Bruce , it had set out to climb the world’s highest mountain, Mount Everest, on the Chinese-Nepali border. In three attempts, the expedition failed to reach the summit, and on the third attempt seven Sherpas died in an avalanche. In his speech, Pierre de Coubertin explained why the medal had been awarded to the expedition:
“For the first time a gold medal is awarded for alpinism, and it is awarded to the glorious expedition to the Mount Everest. Not content with having almost succeeded, they are preparing a renewed effort to finish the ascent.
Mr. Representative of the mission, we welcome your presence for the beautiful heroism displayed. At the foot of the highest mountain in Europe, we present you and your wonderful companions with this small testimony of the admiration with which all nations have followed your journey towards the untouched peaks of the highest mountain in the world. We accompany this gesture by prayers for the completion of a work that will honor not only your country but all humanity.”
The awards were received by Lieutenant Colonel Bill Strutt, as Bruce was unavailable due to preparations for another expedition, starting in February. The second attempt to climb the 8,448 m-high mountain would also fail, and 1922 participant George Mallory would not survive an attempt to reach the peak. But his ultimate fate was only fully known in 1999, when his body was found after 75 years.
Several question marks surround this event. It is not known if there were any other nominations other than the winners of the gold medal. Secondly, it is unclear if all members received a medal, or if just one was awarded for the entire expedition - sources are unclear on this. Finally, we do not know all the names of the expedition members. The names of the Western participants are known, as are those of one Nepalese guide and the Sherpas that perished during the expedition, but some 160 people were supposedly involved.

Italian Federica Pellegrini, at only 16-years-old, burst into contention for the title when she easily won the first semi-final with Solenne Figuès of France winning the second semi in a much slower time. As the early leaders dropped away in the final Pellegrini and Figuès battled away for the lead in the middle lanes and what seemed to be an Olympic title for one of them. What nobody could anticipate was the finishing kick of European champion Camelia Potec of Romania from out in the wastelands of lane one. Potec had crept into the final as the second slowest qualifier but, in a race that never threatened to produce a genuinely fast time; she took the lead in the last ten metres to record a victory that seemed impossible when the race started.

At the NCAA Championships, Sime came against Bobby Joe Morrow of Abilene Christian College and Morrow defeated him in the 100. Then in the 200, Sime pulled a hamstring and would not even make it out of the US Olympic Trials because of the injury. At the Trials, Morrow won both the 100 and 200 and was a heavy favorite at Melbourne. His only major competition seemed to be his diminutive teammate Ira Murchison, who at the CISM (Conseil International du Sport Militaire) Championships in Berlin in August, had run 10.1 for a world record in both the semi-final and final. In the final he met and defeated Willie Williams, who had not made the Olympic team, but had also run a world record 10.1 in the opening round. At Melbourne, Morrow was the class of the field. He won every round of the 100 and 200, and anchored the Americans to a gold medal in the 4 x 100 relay. His times were not outstanding because all the sprint races in Melbourne were run into the wind, but the outcomes were never in doubt.

He had dominated this class from 2011-16, winning four Finn World Cups, but had not won a World medal since that time. He had been the 2019 European Champion, however, and won a silver medal at the 2020 Europeans. The last three World Cups had been won by Max Salminen (SWE/2017), Zsombor Berecz (HUN/2018), and Josh Junior (NZL/2019), who had all competed at Rio de Janeiro in 2016, but none of them had made the podium.
The first two races were won by Turkish sailor Alican Kaynar, with the podium identical as Berecz finished second and Spain’s Joan Cardona was third in both phases. Scott was ninth in both the races and stood ninth entering the third race. He then reeled off three straight victories, but still stood only second behind Cardona, as Kaynar dropped back and was never again a factor in the medal race. Scott also won the sixth race to finally move into the lead. After Junior won the seventh phase, Scott won races eight and nine to separate himself from the field, but the gold medal was still in play entering the medal race, with Berecz second and Cardona third. Berecz won the medal race, with Scott fourth, but it was enough to bring Scott the gold medal as Berecz took silver and Cardona won bronze.
The Finn World Cup was held later in the summer and was won by New Zealand’s Andy Maloney, who had not competed at Tokyo, as New Zealand was represented by Junior. At that event Cardona took silver and Junior claimed the bronze.
The Finn class, a heavyweight single-handed dinghy, had been contested at the Olympics since 1952 when Danish legend Paul Elvstrøm won the second of his four consecutive gold medals in single-handed sailing. But the Tokyo Games would be the last appearance for the Finn class at the Olympics, as it was eliminated from the programme for the Paris 2024 Olympics, in favor of a mixed two-handed class for complete gender equity of the Olympic sailing programme.

Medvedtsev went off 26th with Roetsch having start number 43. None of the leaders had clean shooting rounds, but Roetsch missed three targets to Medvedtsev’s two. However, it didn’t matter because of Roetsch’s superior skiing speed, which brought him home for the gold medal in 56:33.3. As expected, Medvedtsev was second, finishing 21.3 seconds down to Roetsch.

Phelps had said after Beijing that he would never race the 400 IM again but had started training for it in late 2011. But it was too late for London and he barely qualified for the final, placing eighth and having to swim the final in lane eight. The best qualifying time was posted by Japan’s Kosuke Hagino in an Asian record 4:10.01, with Lochte qualifying third.
In the final, Lochte, Phelps and South African Chad le Clos were about even at the end of the butterfly, but the next stroke, the backstroke, was Lochte’s best and he pulled ahead by two bodylengths entering the breaststroke. He was under world record pace at that time and although he could not maintain that, he won gold in 4:05.18. The time was the second fastest ever after Phelps’ winning Beijing world record of 4:03.84, but it was faster than Phelps’ textile world best of 4:06.26.
The silver went to Brazil’s Thiago Pereira, over 3½ seconds behind Lochte, while the bronze went to Hagino, with Phelps off the podium in fourth – only the second time this had ever happened to him at the Olympics, after the 2000 200 butterfly, in which he finished fifth.

Competitors losing to the finalists entered repechage tournament for bronze medals.,na,"Despite never having competed in a senior World Championship, Russia’s Dzhamal Otarsultanov was considered the favorite for the men’s freestyle featherweight event at the 2012 Olympics. Having won the last two European Championships, Otarsultanov defeated compatriot Viktor Lebedev, the reigning World Champion for the past two years, for Russia’s flyweight spot at the London Games. Among his most prominent challengers were Yang Kyong-Il of North Korea, the 2009 World Champion and 2011 Asian Champion, and Hassan Rahimi of Iran, the reigning Asian Champion. Notable as an underdog was Brandon Escobar of Honduras, his nation’s first Olympic wrestler.
Yang and Otarsultanov were drawn in the same half, with the latter defeating the former in the quarterfinals on his way to the gold medal match. This left Rahimi as his most likely challenger, but the Iranian was defeated by 18 year-old Indian Amit Kumar, who had débuted on the international scene earlier in the year with a bronze medal at the 2012 Asian Championships, a tournament won by Rahimi. Kumar in turn was overcome by Georgia’s Vladimer Khinchegashvili, a two-time junior World Champion (2010 and 2011) who had finished seventh at the senior World Championships and only reached the Olympics by winning the European qualifier. With his subsequent defeat of Japan’s Shinichi Yumoto, the 2010 Asian Champion, however, he guaranteed himself a medal in London. The first period of the final went to par terre, where Otarsultanov drew the advantaged position and converted it into a score to win the round. In the second period, the Russian scored point with a takedown in the first ten seconds that was answered soon after by the Georgian pushing his opponent out of the ring. Each scored another point in the second half of the round, but an unsuccessful challenge from the Russian coaches put Khinchegashvili ahead 3-2. Refusing to drag the match on to a third period, Otarsultanov scored another point, to which the Georgian attempted to respond in the dying seconds of the round. When he was not awarded the points, and with nothing to lose (since Otarsultanov had scored the last point and would have won the period anyways), it was the Georgian coaches’ turn for an unsuccessful challenge, leaving the Russian to win the round and capture the gold medal.
For the first of the two third-place podium spots, Yang squared off against Daulet Niyazbekov of Kazakhstan, a bronze medalist from the most recent World Championships. The two seemed evenly, and aggressively, matched at first, with almost the entire first minute spent on the ground and each scoring two points in a first round that went to Yang for having scored the last point. In a conclusion to perhaps one of the most entertaining matches of the tournament, however, Yang displayed complete dominance and won the round early by scoring six unanswered points, earning himself a victory in the match. In the second bronze medal bout, Yumoto faced Radoslav Velikov of Bulgaria, a distinguished wrestler who had won, among other accolades, a bronze medal at the 2008 Summer Olympics, gold at the 2006 World Championships, and silver at the 2005 and 2011 editions. They too were evenly matched, scoring one point each in the first two rounds, but Yumoto was declared the winner of the period in each case and, consequently, of the second bronze medal.

Perhaps better positioned were Denmark’s Ebbe Parsner and Aage Larsen, the defending silver medalists and two-time European Champions and Double Sculls Challenge Cup winners (1949 and 1950). Also thought to be in contention were Peter Stebler and Emil Knecht of Switzerland, the reigning European Champions, and Robert George and Jos Van Stichel of Belgium, the 1952 winners of the Double Sculls Challenge Cup at the Henley Royal Regatta. None of these men, however, would win a medal in Helsinki.
The Swiss, Britons, and Danes all found themselves eliminated by the conclusion of the opening’s round repêchage. The Belgians followed by the end of the semi-final round, leaving five lesser-known duos to contest the final. Of them, Jacques Maillet of France was probably the best known, having been one half of the 1949 European bronze medalists. He and his new partner Achille Giovannoni, however, would not see the podium and remained far from contention throughout the race, besting only the Czechoslovakian pairing of Antonín Malinkovič and Jiří Vykoukal. It was the Argentines, Tranquilo Capozzo and Eduardo Guerrero, who dominated the field, taking the gold medal over six seconds ahead of their nearest challengers, Heorhiy Zhylin and Ihor Yemchuk of the Soviet Union. Uruguay’s Miguel Seijas and Juan Rodríguez came in third. Little did Capozzo, who had been eliminated in the semi-finals of the single sculls in 1948, and Guerrero know that they would have to savour their victory for many decades to come: Argentina would not take home another Olympic gold medal in any sport until 2004.

He never again reproduced that form, and would finish only 24th in the qualifying in München, not making the final. In the final, Saneyev opened with a windy 17.35 (56-11¼) and that would hold up for the gold medal. Drehmel moved into second in round two with 17.02 (55-10¼) and would improve to 17.31 (56-9½) in the fifth round.

That was actually slower than several other previous marks, notably the Olympic record set by Horace Ashenfelter in 1952 (8:45.4). By the time of the Melbourne Olympics, that had been bettered six times, the mark standing at 8:39.8 set by Semyon Rzhishchin in August 1956. Ashenfelter was back but would not qualify for the final.
The race was a close group finish over the last lap, six runners remaining together. Norway’s Ernst Larsen had taken the early lead and would not be caught until two laps remained. On the final lap, Britain’s Chris Brasher saw an opening on the inside and moved past Larsen, brushing him as he did, and pulled away to win.
Shortly after the finish, Brasher was initially disqualified for this move. But the disqualification was appealed and all the other runners supported Brasher, including Larsen, who said it had made no difference. Brasher is well-known among track fans as one of the pacers who supported Roger Bannister during his world record attempt in 1954 that resulted in the breaking of the four-minute mile barrier and also as the co-founder of the London Marathon.

In their absence, the favorite’s role fell to Rolf Gölz (FRG), who had placed second at the 1982 World Championships. Despite the boycott, the field had 33 riders, the largest ever Olympic starting field for this event. The qualifying was led by American Steve Hegg, a former national team ski racer, who won by almost 11 seconds over France’s Pascal Robert, with Golz placing fifth. There were four rounds of match races, and Hegg and Gölz easily made it to the final, with Gölz overtaking his opponents in both the quarters and semis. In the final, Gölz started quickly but Hegg caught him by 2,500 metres and pulled away to an easy victory. In the bronze medal race, another American, Leonard Harvey Nitz, defeated Australian Dean Woods to take third place. After his defeat, Gölz told Hegg, )You wouldn’t have beaten me in Germany,) to which Hegg replied, )I really don’t care - this is Los Angeles.)
Hegg and Nitz’s medals were unusual for the United States in track cycling, although the Eastern Bloc boycott had much to do with this. But shortly after the competition, it was revealed that several members of the American track cycling team, including Hegg and Nitz, had participated in blood doping – usually done by harvesting their own blood several weeks before the competition and then re-injecting it shortly before the event. But because the US team had not planned this correctly, they did not have time to harvest their own blood, so they had blood injected from other donors, a very dangerous practice because of the risk of antibody reactions and viral contamination. This was not illegal at the time, but in 1985, blood doping would be banned by the IOC.

Knutsen was a very consistent competitor, but was still hunting for a major international win. At the 1962 World Championships he placed fourth, clearly behind the winner Arne Larsen. Larsen was normally an excellent jumper, winning the Norwegian Championships in ski jumping 1962, but when he trained harder to improve his cross country abilities, his jumping skills seemed to diminish during the 1963 and 1964 seasons.
The ski jumping part of the Nordic Combined took place on the Normal Hill in Seefeld with Thoma as the winner, but Knutsen, placing second, needed only 12 seconds to beat Thoma in the cross country event. The Soviet Union’s Nikolay Kiselyov came third in the jumping event, but was considered too weak in the cross country to fight for a medal. The bronze medalist of 1960 Nikolay Gusakov, seemed to be a better Soviet medal prospect after placing seventh in the ski jumping. Arne Larsen was disappointed with his 17th place in the jumping event, and the World Champion seemed to be out of contention for a medal.
In the 15 km cross country event Knutsen had a 31 seconds lead over Thoma by 5 km and at the finish he had beaten his rival with a clear margin, 1:33. Thoma had a bad day on the cross country track. He had trouble with his wax, and fell twice during the race. Kiselyov surprised with an excellent cross country race, beating Thoma by 42 seconds and taking the silver medal by a very small margin. Gusakov also made a good race and advanced from seventh to fourth place. Arne Larsen turned out to be the third fastest skier of the day and advanced from 17th to fifth place in the final standings. The Swiss Alois Kälin was clearly the fastest skier of the day, winning the cross country 1:28 ahead of his closest rival. Kälin could only place place 28 out of 32 competitors in the jumping event, but advanced to a final 12th position through his excellent cross country race.

The top two places still went to French fencers, with Georges, Count de la Falaise winning 6 of 7 bouts, and Léon Thiébaut losing only two matches.

The winner of this event from four years ago, Marcel Hirscher, had retired in 2019. He had also won the Crystal Globe in this event in 2018 and 2019 before stepping back, and on each occasion Henrik Kristoffersen and Alexis Pinturault, Olympic silver and bronze medallists in 2018, were second and third behind Hirscher, respectively. Kristoffersen won the Crystal Globe in 2020 and Pinturault in 2021, with Kristoffersen also becoming world champion in 2019. The reigning world champion from 2021, however, was Mathieu Faivre.
The ongoing World Cup season, with five races already contested, saw Marco Odermatt dominate and he had already finished second in the 2021 giant slalom standings. Odermatt won four races in Sölden, Val-d’Isère, Alta Badia 2, and Adelboden, being beaten only in Alta Badia 1 by Kristoffersen. The current standings showed Odermatt holding a big lead from Manuel Feller, Kristoffersen, and Pinturault.
The race day started with a surprise with a heavy snow fall overnight. As all the slopes had been prepared with man-made snow in an area with very little natural snow fall, it put the event to the test. The organisers did their best and the first run started on time although the piste was only cleaned from the snow on a small track and visibility was poor. This had little effect on Odermatt, who set the best run time. Surprisingly next to him was Stefan Brennsteiner with bib number 12 and he missed the top time by only 0.04 seconds. Faivre came third another 0.04 seconds and Kristoffersen in fourth was again 0.04 seconds back. In difficult circumstances the first ten were close together and within a second, just behind was Pinturault, who was already 1.06 seconds behind Odermatt.
On the second run Pinturault was able to improve to fifth place overall and the bronze and silver medals went to Faivre and Žan Kranjec, who improved from eighth place after the first run with the best time in the second run. After Brennsteiner could only finish 27th after a big mistake, Odermatt set the second-best run time to finally win gold 0.19 seconds ahead of Kranjec, who was the first ever medallist in this event for Slovenia.
Remarkable in ninth place, after setting the third best time in the second run, was Andorran Joan Verdú, who had never had a top 30 finish in the World Cup, but achieved his country’s best ever Winter Olympics result and equalled the overall best Olympic result for Andorra, being only 3/100ths of a second behind Kristoffersen.
With Odermatt, manufacturer Stöckli won its first gold in Beijing, Rossignol won another silver and Head took bronze, continuing their podium placements with at least one medal in all races held up to this point. Finishing in 44th position was Fayik Abdi, the first ever Winter Olympian from Saudi Arabia, while Richardson Viano from Haiti, who did not finish the race, became the first ever Winter Olympian for his country. Benjamin Alexander from Jamaica became the first Olympic Alpine skier for his nation and Adrian Yung became the first male Olympic Alpine skier from Hong Kong, China.

There was a qualifying round, with only the top eight teams advancing to the final round. In the qualifying round each team was allowed six competitors, with five to compete on each apparatus, and the best four of five scores counting for each apparatus. Qualifying scores did not carry over to the final round. In the final, each team had six gymnasts, with three allowed to compete on each apparatus, all three scores counting, which was termed the 6/3/3 rule.
This was expected to be a battle between the United States and China, who had won the last two World titles. However, controversy in this event began two weeks before the Olympics when The New York Times posted an article looking at the ages of several of the Chinese gymnasts, and using Chinese sources, noted that several of them were under the age limit of 16-years-old. The Chinese Gymnastics Federation then produced passports verifying their ages, which were accepted by the Fédération Internationale de Gymnastique (FIG), although there was abundant evidence that the gymnasts were not actually old enough to compete by FIG rules. The Chinese team’s girls also averaged only 145 cm tall and 35 kg in weight, far smaller than the American team.
The Chinese had a history of sneaking underage gymnasts into the competition, with the case of Dong Fangxiao at the 2000 Olympics the most notable one. In 2008 she was discovered to have been underage in 2000 and the Chinese lost their team bronze medal from the Sydney Olympics. Despite all this all the Chinese gymnasts were allowed to compete. The start time for the events was not even changed which may have caused several of them to be up past their bedtime.
The USA and China were paired together on the rotations in the final round. The US took the lead on the first rotation, the vault, but China moved ahead on the uneven bars, and was unstoppable on balance beam and floor exercise, winning the gold medal by almost 2½ points. The two nations were the class of the event, as the United States was 5 points ahead of bronze-medal winning Romania.
The IOC declined to investigate the Chinese gymnasts’ ages, leaving it to the FIG to do so. In October 2008 the FIG declared that the Chinese documents proved that all the gymnasts were old enough to compete, with Chinese officials blaming the controversy on administrative errors.

DiCarlo qualified comfortably in third place, as the leading morning qualifier was Fahrner’s teammate Stefan Pfeiffer, followed by American John Mykkanen, and DiCarlo. Fahrner wanted to save himself for the evening final and only aimed for a qualifying time that would put him in outside lane, but he misjudged the qualifying times, placed ninth, and did not make the final.
In the final DiCarlo and Mykkanen fought out a very close race, with DiCarlo winning gold in 3:51.23, nowhere near Salnikov’s times. Mykkanen won silver followed by Australian Justin Lemberg for the bronze. DiCarlo’s set an Olympic record, bettering Salnikov’s 3:51.31 from Moscow, but it did not last long. The B final started 10 minutes after the main final, and Thomas Fahrner elected to race. Putting everything he had into it, Fahrner finished in 3:50.91 to set the Olympic record, despite finishing 9th overall in the event. The officials from FINA initially considered not awarding the Olympic record to Fahrner, but quickly reversed themselves.

The Azeri was declared the victor over Satoshi Shimizu of Japan by 22-17 despite falling to the canvas on six occasions in the final round. He was allowed to continue fighting each time by the referee from Turkmenistan but on appeal the AIBA ruled that at least three of the knockdowns were legitimate under the rules and should have forced an automatic victory for the Japanese fighter. The referee was barred from any further appearances at London 2012 for his performance.
Shimizu progressed to the last four where he fell to Campbell while the other semi-final produced an upset when Nevin gave a virtuoso performance to befuddle Álvarez on the way to a clear victory. With strong support within the venue for both men, the final was a close one for the first two rounds before the Briton drew away in the third and scored a knockdown during the round. Campbell was the first British boxer to win gold at bantamweight since 1908.

The world record holder, and two-time defending Olympic champion, Martin Sheridan (USA), won his his third successive Olympic discus title but failed to match his winning mark from the 1906 Olympics.  Sheridan was at this time unequaled as a discus thrower and an all-around athlete.  Born in Bohola, County Mayo, Ireland, Martin Sheridan emigrated to the United States in 1900, and quickly became the best discus thrower in the world.  He stood 6’3) and weighed 195 lbs. in his prime.
Sheridan is credited with as many as sixteen world records, although it is difficult to be precise in the pre-IAAF period.  Sheridan’s Olympic fame rests primarily on winning the Olympic gold medal in the discus in 1904, 1906, and 1908.  Overall, he won nine Olympic medals, including five gold, counting those Sheridan won in the 1906 Olympics.
Sheridan was a superb jumper and weight thrower, and displayed his other talents in the all-around championship, the early American forerunner of the decathlon.  Sheridan entered three all-arounds in his athletic career, the AAU National Championships of 1905, 1907, and 1909.  He won each of them easily, and set a world record each time, finally leaving it at 7,385 points, a mark which Jim Thorpe broke by only a few points in 1912.

The bronze medal went to German Liselott Linsenhoff as two women won medals in the event for the first time. Linsenhoff would compete at the Olympics again in 1968-72 and won the dressage gold medal at the 1972 Olympics.
Judging controversies affected the 1956 dressage competition as both the Swedish and German judges ranked their riders 1-2-3. The German and Sweden judges, both generals, were suspended by the FEI, and the IOC threatened to take dressage out of the Olympics. After long negotiations it was agreed that there would be no team competition in Rome in 1960, only two individual riders per country would be allowed, and three judges had to be from non-participating countries.
Saint Cyr won four gold medals in dressage in 1952-56 (individual and team both years). He competed at the Olympics from 1936-60. Hartel’s story was inspirational as she been afflicted with polio in 1944 and although she recovered somewhat, she remained paralyzed below the knees for the remainder of her life.

Canada, naturally, had high expectations for its players on home ice, but they preformed poorly in Group A, despite their opening 8-0 shutout of Norway. First they were dragged into a shootout against #7 ranked Switzerland, which they won only with a goal from Sidney Crosby in his second attempt, and then they were outdone 3-5 against the United States, who went undefeated in the preliminary round. Group B was captured by Russia, despite a surprising shootout loss against #9 ranked Slovakia, and an undefeated Sweden. Finland, from Group C, rounded out the automatic qualifiers.
Switzerland, the Czech Republic, Canada, and Slovakia all survived the qualification playoffs, with one of the tournament’s most troublesome moments coming in the Slovakia vs. Norway match. Norway’s Ole Kristian Tollefsen received a game misconduct for a vicious hit on Slovakian Ľuboš Bartečko, which left the latter bleeding profusely on the ice after being hit in the head. The quarterfinals were full of surprises too. In the U.S. vs. Switzerland game, the Swiss held the Americans to two scoreless periods, and nearly had the advantage with an apparent goal at the buzzer of the second period (instant replays later showed that it had crossed the line only after the clock has expired). Canada trounced Russia 7-3 and Slovakia pushed Sweden out of medal contention with a 4-3 victory, allowing them to join Finland in the final four. The U.S. scored six goals against Finland in the first 13 minutes, assuring them a spot on the podium, and Slovakia nearly pulled off the ultimate upset by falling to Canada with a score of just 3-2.
In the bronze medal game, Slovakia fought hard against Finland, and managed to keep their opponents to just one goal, while scoring three of their own, by the end of the second period. Finland battled back, however, and scored four unanswered goals in the final 20 minutes, leaving them with an undefeated (3-0) record in Olympic bronze medal finals, repeating their feats from the 1994 and 1998 Winter Games. The final match between the United States and Canada was a tense one, with Canada leading at the end of the second period by only one point in a 2-1 match. The third period was nearly scoreless, but the Americans played with an empty net for the final minute of the game, allowing Zach Parise to tie up the match with less than 30 seconds to go. In both countries, hockey fans sat on the edges of their seat for another 7 minutes and 40 seconds before Canada’s Crosby slammed the puck into the net, giving Canada it’s Olympic record-setting fourteenth gold medal of the 2010 Winter Olympics, which broke the record of 13 set by the Soviet Union in 1976 and equaled by Norway in 2002. Canadians, the majority of which had been glued to the TV screen during the final, poured into the streets to celebrate their victory and chaotic (but controlled) festivities erupted nation wide. In Toronto, the largest city in the nation, people in the streets stopped traffic and made getting anywhere difficult, while all across the country the citizens belted out the national anthem. Pavol Demitra of Slovakia was the tournament’s top scorer with 10 points, and Jarome Iginla’s five goals, aided by his hat trick against Norway in the opening round, set the standard for the men (the only other hat trick scorer was Norway’s Tore Vikingstad in a 4-5 overtime loss against Switzerland).

At Salt Lake City, he had won a silver medal in the sprint and the team event. But disaster struck on his first jump in Torino, landing at only 92.5 metres, 10½ less than Norway’s leader Petter Tande, and Ackermann stood 25.5 points behind. His second jump was little better, and he finished the jumping tied for 26th, 49 points, and 3:16 behind his teammate, Georg Hettich. Tande, the 2005 World Junior Champion, was in second after the second jump, starting two seconds behind Hettich in the 15 km. The other favorite was thought to be Finland’s Hannu Manninen, who had only medaled at the World Championships in the team event, but was the World Cup champion in 2003-04, 2004-05, and was leading in the current season. He placed eighth on the hill, and was 1:38 back starting the 15 km.
In the ski race, Hettich maintained his lead throughout, winning by 9.8 seconds over Austrian Felix Gottwald, who had placed 11th in the jumping, but was second in the skiing. Tande struggled in the cross-country, finishing only 22nd in that section, and dropping out of the medals, finishing fourth, passed by Austrian Felix Gottwald. He was passed by his teammate, Magnus Moan, who had been ninth in the jumping, but had the third-best ski time, which brought him onto the podium. Moan would place second in the World Cup in 2005-06 and 2006-07. Ackermann had a horrible event, placing 15th in skiing, and 18th overall, but he would again win the World Championships in 2007 and the World Cup in 2007-08. The other favorite, Manninen, finished only 14th in the 15 km, and dropped down to ninth place, even out of the diplomas.

Peters had run the 10K at the London Olympics but had since turned to the marathon. He had won the 1951 Polytechnic race in 2-29:24 and in June 1952, he ran the Windsor-to-Chiswick marathon, the British trial race, in 2-20:42.2, shattering the world record. In Helsinki he faced a straight out-and-back course, starting and finishing at the Olympic Stadium.
The race started at 3:28 PM on a fairly cool day. In the race, making his marathon début, was Czechoslovakian Emil Zátopek. Zátopek had been the star of the Helsinki Olympics, winning the 5,000 and 10K on the track. He had also won the 10K at the 1948 Olympics. Although he had never run the marathon before, his presence was auspicious. As the race started, Peters took the field thru a suicidal pace for 5 km. Zátopek stayed back. Peters led thru 20 km. when he was caught by Zátopek and Sweden’s Gustaf Jansson. At just after two hours, Peters had to withdraw with a muscle cramp. Zátopek never looked back and gradually pulled away from Jansson to the finish, completing his remarkable distance Triple Crown with a margin of 2½ minutes. Argentina’s Reinaldo Gorno passed Jansson at about 39 km. and won the silver medal, with Jansson third.

Tambakos was first up and scored 9.862, one of the highest scores of the entire 2004 Olympic gymnastics competition.

This hurt Frenchman Jason Lamy-Chappuis , who had already won the normal hill gold medal and was leading the World Cup competition coming into Vancouver. Lamy-Chappuis had the best early jump on the hill, but after the re-start he placed only 29th and could not make up enough ground. The jumping was finally led by Austrian Bernhard Gruber. But he was caught almost from the start of the ski run by American Johnny Spillane, who had been second in jumping. They were soon joined by another United States’ skier, Bill Demong, who had placed sixth on the large hill. On the final lap, Spillane fell, which hurt his chances. Demong and Gruber were virtually tied as they entered the stadium with about 500 metres to go, but Demong had far more left in his legs and powered ahead to win by over 10 seconds ahead of Gruber. Gruber, exhausted by his effort, was also passed by Spillane as the Americans finished 1-2. It was the culmination of a great Winter Olympics for the USA Nordic combined team.
Prior to Vancouver, no American had won an Olympic medal in this sport, but in 2010, they won gold and silver on the large hill, silver on the normal hill (Spillane), and a silver in the team event. This was not considered an upset, however, as Demong had been World Champion in the large hill event in 2009, Spillane had won that event in 2003, and Todd Lodwick was 2009 World Champion in the normal hill and mass start event.

In the quarter-finals he met American Justin Huish, who had won a few US titles, but was ranked only 24th internationally. They tied at 112 and in the shoot-off Huish shot two 10s to defeat Frangilli. Huish became a popular player for the American spectators, as he wore his ponytail underneath the back of his backward-facing baseball cap, and was very outgoing. Supported by the fans, he won his last two matches easily to win the gold medal, defeating Sweden’s Magnus Petersson in the final.
Huish would return in 2000 to again make the United States’ Olympic team, but soon after that was caught selling marijuana to a police informant, and withdrew from the team, spending four months in prison. He attempted to qualify for the 2004 Olympics but did not make the team.

Aikido may be translated as “the Way of unifying (with) life energy” or as “the Way of harmonious spirit.” Sixteen (16) different shiai events were demonstrated at Tokyo in 1964 as part of the kendo demonstrations.

Defending champions Germany were still held in high regard, but they had lost the 2010 World Cup final to Australia. The “Kookaburras” had also won the last three Champions Trophies, confirming their world #1 ranking. Other contenders were the host nation, which had won the 2009 European title, perennial medallist the Netherlands, Spain and South Korea.
The Australians got off to a great start in Pool A - winning 6-0 against South Africa and 5-0 vs. Spain - before being held to two draws against Argentina and Great Britain. After four matches, Australia and Great Britain both had 8 points, while Spain and Pakistan had 7, giving all four teams a shot at the semi-finals. The Aussies swept the field with the Pakistanis (7-0), ensuring first place in the group, while the hosts held Spain to a one-all draw for the second semi-final ticket. In the other group, the Dutch won all five of their matches, although their defense proved vulnerable in all matches. Germany took second place, their first match win over Belgium proving decisive.
The first semi-final, a replay of the 2010 World Cup final, saw Australia take the lead twice, with Germany levelling on both occasions. With 10 minutes left to go, Timo Weß first gave Germany the lead with a penalty corner goal, which was extended to 4-2 some minutes later. The other semi was a lopsided affair: the Dutch humiliated the home team with a 9-2 thrashing. This was the highest ever score reached in an Olympic play-off round.
That result gave the Dutch a moral boost going into the final, although they had never beaten Germany (or West Germany) in the final of an international championship, losing to them six times in a European Championship final. And indeed, the Germans took the lead just before half-time, through Jan Philipp Rabente. Tournament top scorer Mink van der Weerden equalized from a penalty corner, but with five minutes to go, Rabente put away a second one. This gave Germany its fourth Olympic title (including one as West Germany in 1972), and the second one in a row. Earlier on the day, Australia had won its sixth consecutive medal, holding off the British team, which had hoped to medal for the first time since 1988.

The new regulations concerning weighing-in caused more difficulties in the flyweight division than in any other. A number of fancied competitors were forced to move up a weight class in order to avoid the possibility of disqualification. This made the prediction of medal hopefuls very difficult although Laurie of the USA, the Frenchman Fayaud, Nunag of the Philippines and the Argentine Carlomagno were touted by some as possible champions.
The 18-year old American Lou Laurie, the youngest member of the US team in Berlin, caught the eye in his first round points victory over Bezděk of Czechoslovakia with his speed and accuracy. After a bye in the opening round, the German fighter Willi Kaiser was also impressive as he forced the referee to stop his second round bout against the Chilean López to save the South American from unnecessary punishment. Kaiser continued his progress with a win over the Uruguayan Fidel Tricánico in the last eight; Tricánico had been fortunate enough to gain a bye in the first round then saw his prospective second round opponent from Peru withdraw in protest at the treatment of the Peruvian football team. The semi-final stage saw Laurie defeated by the strong Sardinian Gavino Matta in a close fight whilst Kaiser turned back the challenge of Carlomagno of Argentina. Laurie won the bronze medal when Carlomagno withdrew and his boxing skills were recognized by the award of the inaugural Val Barker Trophy, presented to the most stylish boxer in the tournament.
In the final Kaiser went on the attack from the outset, forcing the tempo at close quarters and keeping his opponent at bay. When Matta tried to fight back Kaiser pushed the pace even higher and left the Italian with cuts around both eyes. As he tried to turn the fight around Matta became desperate and was warned for fouling his opponent. Towards the end of the fight the Italian tired and Kaiser wrapped up a points decision and Germany’s first ever boxing gold.
The two men met again a year later in the European championship with the same result, although this time it was for the bronze medal rather than gold. Matta and Laurie later turned professional, the Italian winning his national title.

The top favorite prevailed against the Italian Federico Pellegrino, who also won his second consecutive silver. Bronze went to Russian athlete Aleksandr Terentyev. Another of the favorites, 2018 bronze medalist Aleksandr Bolshunov, skipped the race in order to concentrate on the longer events.
For top star Klæbo, who had suffered a bitter defeat in the skiathlon with a 40th place, it was the fourth gold medal of his career. He also became the first runner to win consecutive Olympic sprint titles.
The fastest skier in qualification was Lucas Chanavat from France, who was later eliminated in the semi-final. Both, Pellegrino and Klæbo, won their quarter-finals and qualified 1-2 in the same semi-final. Terentyev finished first in the second semi-final. The other three finalists were Joni Mäki (Finland), Artyom Maltsev (ROC), and Oskar Svensson (Sweden).
Klæbo and Pellegrino controlled the field from the start. After the last climb, only the three eventual medalists were still together. But on the home stretch, the third placed Terentyev had no chance to catch the leading two. On the final run-in, it was just Klæbo and Pellegrino, with Klæbo outpacing the Italian by 0.26.

Again, their national team coach (Vanderlei Luxemburgo) also led the Olympic squad. And, as in 1996, the Brazilians progressed despite a first round shock loss, this time to South Africa. But, as in Atlanta, the Brazilians went out by a golden goal against an African team. The Brazilians were lucky to get into extra time, Ronaldinho scoring the equaliser in stoppage time despite the “Indomitable Lions“ being down two men due to red cards. Modeste M’Bami ended the Brazilians’ Olympic dream, and Luxemburgo was sacked. Cameroon progressed into the final, coming back from a 78th minute own goal to win 2-1 against Chile. The Spaniards had had a somewhat easier road to the final, winning against Italy and the United States in the knockout phase. The final was a real thriller. Spain went ahead by a goal from Xavi, and missed the opportunity to double the lead when 16-year-old goalie Idriss Kameni stopped a penalty. Gabri then scored the 2-0 anyway, seemingly sealing Spain’s second Olympic title after 1992. But Cameroon fought back, and scored two goals within five minutes in the second half. Gabri was then sent off for a flying tackle, followed by his team mate José Mari when he received his second yellow. This left Cameroon in charge during extra time, and they appeared to have won when a goal by star player Samuel Eto’o was disallowed for offside, although the attacker had started from his own half. After 120 minutes, penalty shots had to decide the champion, the first time in an Olympic football final. All Cameroonians scored, while Iván Amaya missed for Spain. Amaya definitely did not have the night of his life: he had already put a header behind his own keeper for the 2-1.

In Rio Fiji were very much the gold medal favourites but by 2021 they had been superseded by New Zealand, who won both the 2018 World Sevens Cup and the latest edition of the season long World Sevens Series. South Africa and Australia were the other automatic qualifiers from the World Series and were expected to be medal contenders too.
The pool stage generally proceeded as excepted but for the defeat of Australia at the hands of Argentina. This meant the Aussies would have to play Fiji in the quarter finals instead of less frightening opponents. Argentina staged another giant killing in those quarter-finals when they survived a late comeback by South Africa whilst the USA squandered a twenty-one-point lead to be beaten 26-21 by Great Britain.
On the other hand, the progress of both New Zealand and Fiji was smooth in the knockout stages of the competition and both duly took their places in the final.
Meli Derenalagi capitalized on New Zealand losing possession after 55 seconds of the final to score a try that put Fiji ahead. A minute later came the decisive moment of the game. A New Zealander fumbled the ball inside his own try line and Sireli Maqala pounced on his mistake to put Fiji 12-0 ahead. From then on the pattern was set as both teams traded scores, but New Zealand could never close the gap and were eventually beaten 27-12 and Fiji, despite being deeply affected by COVID 19 as both a team and a country, successfully retained the Olympic title.
After receiving their Olympic medals, the Fijian team sang the traditional Fijian song “E Da Sa Qaqa” to a worldwide audience from the medal podium. In the bronze medal game Argentina won South America’s first Olympic rugby medal by beating Great Britain. Argentina’s Marcos Moneta was the top try scorer in the tournament while Andrew Knewstubb of New Zealand was the leading points scorer.

On his return home, Miresmaeli was given $125,000, the amount given to Iranian gold medal winners, and a ticket to visit Mecca. The Iranian state news agency IRNA quoted then Iranian President Mohammad Khatami as saying, “Miresmaeili’s actions would be recorded in the history of Iranian glories.” Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, then the mayor of Tehran, and later Iran’s President, said that although Miresmaeili “did not get a gold medal, he earned eternal honor by his refusal.” The International Judo Federation investigated this incident, but strangely, when they did so, Miresmaeli claimed he had made no such statements and no sanction was given. Miresmaeli did compete at the 2008 Olympic Games, after winning bronze medals at the 2005 and 2007 World Championships, but finished only =9th.

In June 1929 Snook was practicing at the Ohio State rifle range when he was arrested and accused of the murder of Theora K. Hix, a medical student at Ohio State. It turned out that Snook and Hix had posed as man and wife for three years, sharing an apartment near the school’s campus. On 13 June 1929, Snook claimed that Hix asked him to divorce his wife and marry her, threatening to kill his wife and child if she was refused. Snook confessed to then beating Hix several times with a hammer before severing her jugular vein with a pocketknife to, in his own words, “relieve her suffering”. On 14 August 1929 a jury deliberated only 28 minutes before finding Snook guilty of first-degree murder. A week later he was sentenced to be put to death, and at 7:10 PM (1910) on 28 February 1930, he died in the electric chair at the Ohio State Penitentiary.

But he was also a top archer and competed on the Finnish team that won the World Team Championship in 1958, and he was Finnish champion in archery in 1955. But Rautavaara is best remembered in Finland for his singing and acting. He toured Finland performing in the 50s and early 60s, and eventually recorded over 300 songs.

Although the best that they had done recently at the World Championships was third in 2007, they were considered favorites at the 2008 Summer Olympics, as no other nation had emerged as a particularly strong or consistent contender. The reigning World Champions, 2004 Olympic bronze medalists Yuliya Bichik and Nataliya Gelakh of Belarus, were sent to Beijing, as were New Zealand’s 2005 World Champions, Juliette Haigh and Nicky Coles. Germany had been the 2005 World runner-up and the 2006 bronze medalist, but was represented by Lenka Wech and Maren Derlien, who had won the European Championships when it was resurrected in 2007. Canada, the 2006 World Champion, sent Sabrina Kolker and Zoë Hoskins, the latter of whom had won a silver medal at the 2007 Pan American Games.
The opening heats were won by Belarus and Romania, the latter of whom posted the fastest time, while the Canadians failed to finish after their boat capsized. They were then eliminated in the repêchage. In the final, the Romanians had little trouble claiming victory, but Belarus found itself fighting off a strong challenge from the Chinese crew, Wu You and Gao Yulan. Belarus lost this battle, allowing China to take silver by 0.63 seconds, while Bichik and Gelakh settled for bronze once again.

In the semi-finals, it was Australia, the reigning World runner-up, who finished fastest, likely due to the challenge they faced from the Italians in their heat, whom they managed to defeat by a margin of only 0.28 seconds. France, meanwhile, experienced a surprise elimination in Great Britain’s heat.  Particularly in consideration of the absence of the French crew, the final was far more exciting than expected, with Great Britain and Italy battling down to the line for the gold medal.

He then cleaned & jerked 217.0 kg and predicted that his total of 402.0 kg would win the gold medal. However, Poland’s Szymon Kołecki, world record holder in the clean & jerk, lifted 224.0 kg in that lift and totalled 403.0 kg. He was then beaten by Ilyin who put up 226 kg in the clean & jerk to win the gold medal with a total of 406.0 kg. Paşayev had the best snatch in Group A with 181.0 kg but struggled in clean & jerk and placed only fifth, while Konstantinov was never a factor, finishing eighth.
Akkayev’s total held on for a rare B Group bronze medal, but he was not happy. He started in the B Group because of his low starting weight which he attributed to his coach, noting, “My coach is a jerk. If I had competed in Group A I would have won the gold.” Ilyin would return in 2012 and defend his gold medal in London.
That was how the event and the results seemed to have ended. In 2015, however, the IOC began re-testing samples from the 2008 Beijing and 2012 London Olympics, using newer, more advanced testing techniques, in an effort to find those who had used performance enhancing drugs (PEDs), but in whom it could not be detected at the time of those Olympics. This was one of the many events affected.
In November 2016, the standings completely changed when Ilya Ilyin (KAZ / gold), Khadzhimurat Akkayev (RUS / bronze), and Nizami Paşayev (AZE / 5th) all tested positive for anabolic steroids, and were all disqualified. The medals were re-assigned as follows: Gold – Szymon Kołecki (POL); Silver – Arsen Kasabijew (GEO); and Bronze – Yoandry Hernández (CUB).
In 2012 Ilya Ilyin again seemed to win the gold medal in this class, but in November 2016, his sample from the London Games also re-tested positive, that time for turinabol (dehydrochloromethyltestosterone) and stanozolol. He was again disqualified, making him the only Olympian ever to lose two gold medals at different Games for PED usage.

Eight boarders bettered one minute, with Anderson’s teammate, Ross Rebagliati, in eighth at 59.87. Tied for second were Thomas Prugger (ITA) and Chris Klug (USA). The second run was marred by bad weather, with light snow and fog coming in, which caused the competition to be re-started for this run. When it was re-started Switzerland’s Ueli Kestenholz went off sixth and posted the fastest run of the round. Two boarders later, Rebagliati posted what would be the second fastest run in the second round, and moved into first place overall. He waited out the next seven boarders, and when Anderson struggled into 22nd place on the run, Rebagliati had the gold medal, with Prugger in second and Kestenholz third.
Or so it seemed. Three days later it was announced that Rebagliati would be stripped of his gold medal because he had tested positive for marijuana. This was immediately appealed by the Canadian Olympic Committee, and sent for a decision to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS). The ruling came down in Rebagliati’s favor, based on the fact that marijuana was considered a restricted substance, rather than a prohibited substance. The FIS explained that they had requested marijuana testing only for “fear related events” and not snowboarding. This was important, because snowboarders had somewhat of an alternative lifestyle, often with lots of partying, and marijuana was frequently present at the parties. Rebagliati explained that he had not recently been using, but had attended several parties at which there was a lot of marijuana use and he thought his positive was due to second-hand smoke. After the CAS ruling, Rebagliati was allowed to keep his gold medal.
Finishing in seventh place overall was Austrian Martin Freinademetz, who later had his Olympic Acceditation revoked. During a party at the Shiga Kogen Prince Hotel, he became quite drunk, and damaged a $4,000 switchboard. He offered to pay for the damage but the IOC was not amused.

Then there was also the home-town favorite, Jeremy Wotherspoon. Long a dominant force in the 500 m, Wotherspoon had missed the 2008-09 season after breaking his arm in a fall. Lacking only an Olympic gold medal in his prize cabinet, Wotherspoon was hoping to fill that void in Vancouver.
The race had trouble getting underway. Halfway through the first run, the two ice resurfacing machines broke down. The spare machine then damaged the ice. Many coaches and team leaders then pressed for a postponement, but the referees eventually decided to continue the race under pressure from the ISU president, Ottavio Cinquanta. With one machine repaired, the event was continued after an hour and a half delay. It was Mika Poutala, known for his pre-start antics, who had clocked the best time, 34.863. He was closely trailed by the surprising Mo Tae-Beom of South Korea and Kato. But several others were not far off the medal pace, the with the entire top ten less than three tenths off the leader’s pace.
But the positions would shift quite a bit in second race. Keiichiro Nagashima of Japan moved up from sixth to silver medal position with 34.876, the best time of the second run. He was then topped in overall time by Mo, who was marginally faster than his own first run. The last race was then between Kato and Poutala. The leading Finn seemingly succumbed to the pressure, and only recorded the 11th best time and dropped out of the medals. Kato, a former world record holder, only had to beat Mo’s time by 0.014, but instead failed to break the 35-second barrier. Although Kato held on to third place, this gave the gold to Mo Tae-Beom, who had never before had won an international competition, and was considered more of a middle distance expert.

O’Sullivan ran the 5,000 earlier in the Games but came down with an intestinal disorder and was not herself, and did not qualify for the 1,500 final. In the semis, Boulmerka stumbled in heavy traffic, sprained an ankle, and finished last, also not qualifying. That left the final open for Masterkova, who took the lead at 1,200 metres. Though Gabriela Szabo (ROM) and Theresia Kiesl (AUT) moved to her shoulder on the final curve, she powered away to an easy victory. She was the first women to win the 800/1,500 double since Soviet Tatyana Kazankina in 1976.

By 37 km. a small lead group had formed with Algerian-born Frenchman Boughera El Ouafi, Chile’s Manuel Plaza, American Joie Ray, Finland’s Martti Marttelin, and Japan’s Kanematsu Yamada. Ray briefly took the lead but was quickly passed and faded to finish fifth. Yamada then assumed the lead but he fell to the ground with cramps. Though he was able to get up and finish, he would finish fourth. Over the last five km., El Ouafi and Plaza opened up ground on Marttelin. El Ouafi would pull away shortly before entering the stadium and won the gold medal by 26 seconds over Plaza, with Marttelin third. El Ouafi was the first native-born African to win an Olympic gold medal. He had competed at the 1924 Olympics, but had competed very little since then. However, he served as a dispatch carrier for the French army in the war against Abdel Krim in 1926, running long distances in the desert which maintained his condition. After the Olympics, he turned professional and competed briefly in the United States.

Alekseyev was expected to win easily, and he did, leading after the snatch by 15 kg and winning the gold medal by 35 kg over East German Gerd Bonk. Bonk, the 1976 and 1979 European Champion, had also been second to Alekseyev at the 1975 World Championships but was unlucky to compete in the same era and never won a major international championship in which Alekseyev competed. Alekseyev would try to three-peat in 1980 at Moskva but was by then past his prime, failed to make a lift in the snatch, and was eliminated.

Henry made a poor start to the final and trailed the field in the early stages. Recovering to fifth at 50 metres the Australian took the lead at the three-quarter mark and held off the challenge of de Bruijn to record a first Aussie win in the event since the glory days of Dawn Fraser 40 years earlier with Coughlin filling up the final place on the victory podium.

Evans went out fast, having a body length over Hayley Lewis (AUS) at 200 metres and only opening her margin throughout, winning by eight metres.
This was the fourth, and final, gold medal of Evans’ career, as she had won the 400 and 800 free and 400 IM in Seoul. She made the 1996 Olympic team in this event, but could only finish sixth in the final, and then retired. Or so it seemed.

She qualified for the US Olympic Trials in Omaha, but was not close to making the team in either the 400 or 800 freestyle.
Hayley Lewis had an outstanding career in the international pool from 1990-95.

Her compatriot Sabine Völker then again improved the time at World Cup on the Olympic ice, clocking 1:14.06. In addition to these women, defending champion Marianne Timmer (Netherlands) and Jennifer Rodriguez had also won World Cup races during the ongoing season.
Timmer was the first to beat 1:15, well below her Olympic Record from 1998. Next up was Witty, who faced 500 m champion Catriona Le May Doan. The Canadian went off very quickly, and was still leading at the bell. But while Le May slowed down in the final lap, Witty finished very quickly (28.90), and broke the 1:14 barrier for a world record of 1:13.83. Her final lap time was only beaten by Rodriguez in the next pair (28.61), but her first 600 m had been slower, and she ended with 1:14.24. Sabine Völker then seemed set to match Witty’s time, but narrowly missed it, coming home in 1:13.93. As Garbrecht also failed on the final lap, the title went to Witty. That came as a surprise, as Witty had needed to cut back on training all season. According to Witty, that was due to mononucleosis, but she later revealed a different reason. She had been sexually abused as a child by a family friend, and had experienced a lot of trouble dealing with this emotionally in the run-up to the Salt Lake Games.

For the European Championships it was Achim Hill, who had won silver medals for a unified German team at the past two Olympics, as well as the 1966 Diamond Challenge Sculls at the Henley Royal Regatta, and was now seeking the top spot for East Germany. The world champion, Donald Spero of the United States, was not present in Mexico City and his nation was represented by John Van Blom, but the Pan American champion, Argentina’s Alberto Demiddi, did attend. Great Britain, meanwhile, sent the runner-up from the Diamond Challenge Sculls, Kenneth Dwan, instead of winner Hugh Wardell-Yerburgh. Also notable were Canada’s Roger Jackson, a 1964 Olympic champion in the coxless pairs, and Czechoslovakia’s Václav Kozák, a 1960 Olympic gold medalist in the double sculls. Ivanov’s successor, meanwhile, was the relatively untested Viktor Melnikov.
The fastest time in the opening round, however, went to Jan Wienese of the Netherlands, bronze medalist at the last two editions of the European Championships and runner-up at the 1966 World Championships. The other heat winners were Jochen Meißner of West Germany, the 1965 European Champion, 1966 World silver medalist, and the 1967 runner-up in the Diamond Challenge Sculls, who had been considered a slight favorite prior to the Games, and the relatively unknown Niels Henry Secher of Denmark, whose time was beaten in other heats by Hill and Demiddi. Wienese and Hill took their heats in the semi-finals, although Demiddi in Wienese’s heat had a faster time than Hill. Melnikov, Kozák, Jackson, and Secher, meanwhile, were all eliminated for having failed to finish within the top six, which was rounded out by Van Blom, Meißner, and Dwan. In the final, Wienese moved to the front just after the first half and remained there for the rest of the race, winning by a comfortable margin of over four seconds. Meißner, therefore, settled for silver well ahead of Demiddi, whose bronze was an improvement on his fourth-place finish from the 1964 Games. Wienese had thus won the Netherlands’ first Olympic gold medal in rowing since 1924.

However, Dod’s marks sufficed to keep him in the lead and earn him the gold medal.
William Dod was certainly not favored.  Since 1900, the British National Championship had been divided among Brooks-King (5 titles - 1900, 1902-03, 1906, 1908), with John Penrose, John Bridges, Eyre Hussey, and Hugh Nesham winning a single championship.
Dod would win his only British title in 1909.  He was the brother of Lottie Dod, the runner-up in the women’s archery, and likely the greatest female all-arounder in British sporting history.  They were appropriately descended from Sir Antony Dod of Edge, who commanded the English archers at Agincourt.  From a wealthy family, William Dod never had to worry about school or work, and spent his time in the pursuit of his sporting interests.  He was also quite accomplished in golf and big game hunting.

Bolt had made plans that this time there would be no celebrating and he would run hard throughout, trying to break Johnson’s record. Unfortunately, the race was run into a wind of 0.9 metres/second. But it mattered not. Bolt, running in lane five, made up the stagger on lane six by 50 metres, and hit the century mark in 10.0 flat, faster than Johnson had run in his world record (10.12).

Also competing for a medal was his team mate Robert Vunderink, a marathon skater, he did not regularly compete with long track skaters. Having set his sights on the Olympic 10,000 m, Vunderink had surprisingly beaten all aforementioned favorites in a December World Cup at Heerenveen.
Vunderink was the first of these four to ride. A slow starter, he eventually finished in 14:22.92. That assignment proved easy for Karlstad in the next pair, who did open a bit too fast, costing him in the latter part of the race. His time was 14:18.13. Koss, skating one pair later, trailed slightly behind Karlstad’s splits for most of his race. But he took advantage of his team mate’s slower final laps, and finished almost four seconds faster: 14:14.58. With the lap times of his opponents known, this gave Veldkamp the blue print for his own race. Leading the Norwegian by five seconds with seven laps to go, Veldkamp felt he had the gold in his hands, and slowed down slightly to win in 14:12.12. As in Karlstad’s win in the 5,000 m, Veldkamp’s gold medal was the first for the Netherlands since the 1976 Olympics.
After his gold medal, Bart Veldkamp set his sights on competing in the 1992 Summer Olympics. He hoped to become part of the Dutch team pursuit squad in track cycling, but was eventually not selected for the Games. After competing in the 1994 Olympics, Veldkamp traded his Dutch passport for a Belgian one to avoid the tough Dutch selection process. Competing for his new nation, he won a bronze medal at the 1998 Games.

Future world professional champion, Vic Toweel of South Africa, lost to Pares in the opening match, but Pares was not to match the achievements of his flyweight and heavyweight team-mates and was defeated by Australia’s Jimmy Carruthers in the second round. Carruthers was unfortunate to sustain an eye injury in that match and had to withdraw from the tournament.
The beneficiary of Carruthers’ misfortune was the Hungarian boxer Tibor Csik and he proved able to maximize his opportunity. The Hungarian used his speed and mobility to outscore Italy’s Gianni Zuddas in the final.
Csik left Hungary and lived in Australia until his death in 1976. Juan Venegas became the first Puerto Rican to stand on the Olympic podium when he defeated his Spanish opponent in the bronze medal match.
In 1950, Vic Towell became the first South African to hold a universally recognised world professional title after defeating Manuel Ortiz. After four defences, he lost to Jimmy Carruthers on a first round knockout in a bout refereed by 1924 Olympic bantamweight champion, Willy Smith. Carruthers had an unusual ally helping him to weigh inside the bantamweight limit – after his retirement he was found to have been carrying a 30 foot long tapeworm inside him.

France, represented in Atlanta by Gilles Bosquet, Daniel Fauché, Bertrand Vecten, and Olivier Moncelet, were the 1993 World Champions and the 1994 runners-up.
The opening heats, and the three fastest times, went to Italy, Great Britain, and Australia in that order. The British crew, Rupert Obholzer, Tim Foster, and brothers Jonny and Greg Searle, were the 1995 World runners-up and the 1994 bronze medalists, while the Searle siblings had taken Olympic gold in the coxed pairs in 1992. They won their semi-final heat with ease, as France, Italy, and Australia all faced each other in the other one. This race seemed to promise an exciting final, with only 0.37 separating them at the finish line and only 0.04 seconds between first-place France and runner-up Italy. The medal round was a little more spread out, however, although the podium finishers were all still within one second of each other. Australia, the gold medalist, had the most leeway, while France and Great Britain battled to the line for silver, which the former won by only 0.25 seconds. Even for bronze, however, the British could not relax, for the Slovenians were on their tail and missed the podium by only 0.59 seconds. Italy, meanwhile, seemed to have tired and finished sixth and last.

It was quite an upset, made more so by the fact that Argentina was not considered the best team in South America, that being Uruguay, which had won the South American Championships in 1947 and 1949.  American dominance was also threatened by the presence of the Soviet Union, which competed in the Olympics for the first time in 1952. They had been European Champions in 1947 and 1951, not competing in 1949, when the title was oddly won by Egypt.
The US team was made up of seven players from the NCAA Champions, the University of Kansas, five players from the Peoria Caterpillar team, which won the final US Trials, and two players from the Phillips Petroleum team. The star of the US team was the 7-foot center from the Phillips team, Bob Kurland, who was responsible for the rules being changed to prevent goaltending, and the enlargement of the lane from 6 feet to 12 feet. He was assisted by Clyde Lovellette of the University of Kansas. Lovellette had a long NBA career and became the first player ever to play on NCAA, Olympic, and NBA Champion teams.
In the semi-final pools, the USA played the Soviet Union and dispatched them easily, 86-58. But they met again in the finals, and the USSR responded by stalling to hold down the score. The score was only 17-15 at halftime, but the USA pulled away in the second half to win 36-25.

She had a young teammate, Michela Figini, who was only 17, but had already moved up into the seeds for the Olympics.
The event was affected by the weather as the men’s downhill had been in 1984, and was delayed five days because of snow and fog. Off fifth, Figini posted a time of 1:13.36, and watched as the other top skiers came down. Walliser was 10th down the mountain but narrowly missed out, falling 0.05 seconds behind Figini.

Best six of seven scores to count for final placement.,na,"The Soling class made its Olympic début at the 1972 Olympics and would remain on the Olympic Program through 2000. At München, both the Soling and Dragon were raced as three-person keelboat designs, but after 1972, the Soling would be the three-person keelboat event until it was replaced by the Yngling in 2004. The Soling was designed by Norwegian yacht designer Jan Linge who was working on modifications to the 5.5-metre class in the early 1960s. Linge’s designs turned into the Tempest class, although that design is credited to Ian Proctor, but eventually Linge modified the design into what became the Soling. Linge also designed the Yngling in 1967.
This event was delayed several days by light winds on 5 September, the Olympic suspension on 6 September due to the Israeli Massacre back in München, and heavy fog on 7 September. Racing on the Alpha course, the Soling was only completed on 8 September, but only six races could be held. The gold was easily won by American skipper Buddy Melges, Jr. who had three race wins, a second, a third, and a fourth to win the class. Melges had won a bronze medal in Flying Dutchman at the 1964 Olympics. In 1992 he co-skippered the America 3 to victory in the America’s Cup, making him the first sailor to win both an Olympic gold medal and the America’s Cup.
Canada won the bronze medal, with Paul Côté a crew member. In 1971 he formed a group of five that called themselves the “Don’t Make a Wave Committee,” whose purpose was to sail to Amchitka Island in Alaska and disrupt a US nuclear test. A boat did get near the nuclear zone, but Côté was not on it. The group became famous, however, when it later expanded and changed their name to Greenpeace.
Denmark’s Paul Elvstrøm started in the Soling, attempting to win his fifth Olympic gold medal after winning the one-person dinghy four times consecutively from 1948-60. He was disqualified in the fifth race after a bumping incident with the French boat, was quite unhappy with the decision, and refused to start the final race. The helmsman of the 10th-placed Norwegian boat was HRH Crown Prince Harald.

She had won 21 straight games and dropped just one set in three Olympics that saw her as champion (with Misty May) in 2004, 2008 and 2012. Her new partner, Ross, was a silver medallist in London four years earlier. Strangely, the new pairing reached only the last 16 at the 2015 World Championship, losing to the Chinese pair of Wang Fan and Yue Yuan, in a tournament that saw the Brazilian women dominate all three medal places with Bárbara Seixas and Ágatha Bednarczuk taking gold. They were considered serious contenders for the gold medal on home sand in Rio, as were the other local favourites Larissa França and Talita Antunes. The two Brazilian teams were seeded one and two in Rio, with Walsh Jennings and Ross number three, and with the German world number ones Laura Ludwig and Kira Walkenhorst ranked four.
As expected, Walsh Jennings and Ross qualified for the final 16 but not until a tense final match against the Swiss girls Isabelle Forrer and Anouk Vergé-Dépré. The Americans won 21-13, 22-24, 15-12 and it was the first set they had dropped in the 2016 competition and only the second that Walsh Jennings had dropped in her Olympic career. Larissa and Talita qualified without dropping a set as did Elsa Baquerizo and Liliana Fernández of Spain. A vastly experienced duo, the Spaniards were one of six teams (men and women) to have competed at both London 2012 and Rio 2016, but they had the distinction of being the partnership who had played together the most and their opening game in Rio was their 420th match together. Perhaps the biggest names to fail to make it through the qualifying matches were those of the Americans Lauren Fendrick and Brooke Sweat who finished bottom of their group.
The clash of the last 16 was between Larissa and Talita and the German seventh seeds, Karla Borger and Britta Büthe and it was the home favourites who came through 21-17, 21-19. The Spaniards Elsa and Liliana put up a great fight in losing to the FIVB 23rd ranked pair Yekaterina Birlova and Yevgeniya Ukolova of Russia, 21-23, 22-24, while the reigning world champions Bárbara and Ágatha won 21-12, 21-16 against the Chinese pair Wang and Yue. Kerry Walsh Jennings remained on course for her fourth consecutive gold medal with a straight sets win over the Italians Marta Menegatti and Laura Giombini, who came into the Italian team just three days before it started, after Viktoria Orsi Toth was banned after testing positive for a banned substance.
The Brazilian duos of Larissa and Talita and Bárbara and Ágatha reached the semi-finals, but Larissa and and Talita only did so after winning the match of the tournament  against the Swiss pair Joana Heidrich and Nadine Zumkehr 21-23, 27-25, 15-13. The four Brazilians were joined in the semis by Ludwig and Walkenhorst of Germany and Ross and Walsh Jennings, who celebrated her quarter-final victory on her 38th birthday.
The semi-finalists were made up of the top four seeds and it was a mixed day for the partisan Brazilian crowd. Firstly they had to witness top seeds Larissa and Talita lose in straight sets to the Germans 21-18, 21-12, but then they witnessed a piece of Olympic beach volleyball history as American Kerri Walsh Jennings lost her first ever match at the Olympics as second seeds Bárbara and Ágatha won 22-20, 21-18 against Walsh Jennings and April Ross. Prior to this match Walsh Jennings had only lost two sets in her 26-match Olympic career, now that figure had doubled.
In the bronze medal match, which many expected to be the gold medal match before the start of the tournament, Walsh Jennings and Ross looked down and out midway through the second set against Larissa and Talita after losing the first 21-17 and were trailing by three points in the second, but  the American girls picked themselves up and set up a deciding set with a 21-17 win. Walsh Jennings made some crucial blocks in the third as the Americans ran out 15-9 winners.
In the final, Bárbara and Ágatha were the first Brazilian pair to appear in a women’s final since 2004 and were hoping to become only the second Brazilian winners of the gold medal after Sandra Pires and Jackie Silva in 1976. For Germany it was their first appearance in the final and they were guaranteed their first ever women’s medal. Whilst the Brazilians had the fervent support of the packed Copacabana Beach Arena behind them, they were no match for the German’s Ludwig and Walkenhorst. A neck-and-neck first set played in a strong wind, saw the lead change hands five times and was eventually won by the Germans 21-18, but in the second set the European girls led from the start and ran out comfortable 21-14 winners to capture their first ever medal, and the first ever women’s beach volleyball medal by a European country as they emulated their male counterparts Julius Brink and Jonas Reckermann who won gold in 2012.

Double Olympic champion Claressa Shields had graduated to the professional ranks and already established herself as the supreme force in that version of the sport. This prompted Christina Hammer, the German whose 10-year reign as professional world champion Shields had ended, to make the opposite journey and attempt a late career switch to “amateur” boxing. Sadly, the cancellation of the final global qualifier ended Hammer’s dreams before they could begin to take shape.
Since 2016 two women had emerged as the best middleweights in the world. Nouchka Fontijn of the Netherlands had twice been European champion, a regular medallist at World Championship level and silver medallist behind Shields in Rio, while Lauren Price of Great Britain had pushed the Dutchwoman in a number of championships before 2019. In 2019 Price beat Fontijn in the final of the European Games before the two staged a memorable battle later in the year at the World Championship. Fontijn was originally awarded the fight but after an appeal, the bout review jury controversially decided to re-score it in favour of Price. In Tokyo, the two were seeded to meet in the semi-finals.
To no one’s surprise Price-Fontijn turned out to be another closely fought bout. Fontijn started well and, after Price was deducted a point for holding in round two, it appeared that the Dutch boxer was going to extract her revenge for the world final. Price rallied to take the second round and the deciding third to win by the slim margin of 3-2 from the judges.
In the final, Price would meet her predecessor at World Champion, the tall Chinese fighter Li Qian. Li had won world title in 2018 but then had not been selected for the 2019 Worlds. From the start Price used her speed and agility to great effect, jabbing away and then moving out of distance of any counter punching. She took the first two rounds then landed some punches as the fight came towards its end.
Price had begun as a footballer, playing for Wales in international football whilst maintaining a side career as a World Champion kickboxer. She had also been a part of the British developmental taekwondo squad before concentrating on boxing.

The 1947 European Champion had been the Soviet Union, but they did not participate in the 1948 Olympics, so by default, the Americans were still considered the heavy favorites.
The bulk of the United States came from the University of Kentucky, which won the NCAA Championship in 1948, and would repeat in 1949.

Haug was not considered to be among the four best of Norway’s ski jumpers, but his place on the team was given in honour of his great allround abilities as a skier.
The only serious contender against the Norwegian supremacy was considered to be the Norwegian-born US jumper Anders Haugen, known for his long and daring jumps but also for his rugged style and unstable landings.
In the first round Thams with start number 3 took the lead with a jump of 49 m, ahead of Bonna (47,5) and Haugen (49), Haug lying 4th with 44 m with superb style marks. In the second round Thams produced another 49 m jump with better style points than in his first.

Bonna was the last of the favorites to jump, and he equaled Thams 49 m but was not able to beat his countryman Thams in the total points. Another clean medal sweep for the Norwegians, gold to Thams, silver to Bonna and bronze to Haug, Haugen given 4th place and the 4th Norwegian Landvik in 5th.
After the conclusion of the event, some jumpers made an exhibition for the enthusiastic audience, jumping with top speed. Thoralf Strømstad, silver medallist in both in the 50 km and in Nordic Combined, made 57,5 m, the longest jump so far in the history of ski jumping. His mark was equaled later in the exhibition by Thams and Bonna.
Almost 40 years later, the aforementioned Strømstad contacted Norwegian ski historian Jacob Vaage, claiming that the points from the ski jumping event for Thorleif Haug had been miscalculated, and that his final points should be behind Haugen’s. Vaage checked the case and had to agree with the 77-year-old Strømstad. In 1974 IOC decided to award the bronze medal to Haugen, at that time an elderly gentleman of 86. He was invited to Norway, and at a nice ceremony Haug’s bronze medal from 1924 was handed over to Haugen by Haug’s youngest daughter. Thorleif Haug himself died already in December 1934 from pneumonia at the age of 40. But Haugen was pleased to meet some of his Norwegian competitors from 1924: Narve Bonna, Einar Landvik and not to mention Thoralf Strømstad, the man responsible for justice being made after 40 years.

China’s entry in the 2012 Olympic tournament was Li Xueying, 2009 World Champion and 2011 runner-up. There was also a possibility of a challenge from Pimsiri Sirikaew of Thailand, bronze medalist at the most recent World Championships, but Novikova and Li were strongly favored for the crown.
With a lift in the snatch of 108 kg Li bested the Olympic record set by her compatriot Chen Yanqing, winner of the last two gold medals in the event, and placed herself in an advantageous position for the clean and jerk portion. Yuliya Kalina of Ukraine, bronze medalist at the 2009 World Championships and 2009 European runner-up, came in close second with 106 kg while Boyanka Kostova of Azerbaijan, reigning European Champion and a world silver medalist in the featherweight in 2010, managed 105 kg. With lifts of 103 and 100 kg respectively, Novikova and Sirikaew fell to joint-fourth and joint-ninth.
Already ahead of the competition, Li began the clean and jerk with a greater weight than anyone else, successfully lifting 133 kg on her first attempt. This weight (or lower) eliminated most of her challengers, including Novikova and Kostova, the latter of whom failed at her first attempt with 124 kg and only managed 128 kg in the end. Kalina too only managed 129 kg, but this had been good enough for gold until she was dethroned by Li. Rattikan Gulnoi of Thailand then lifted 134 kg, four above her personal best, to enter the bronze medal spot. She was quickly kicked out by her teammate Sirikaew, however, who lifted 136 kg to enter the silver medal spot, a feat that Gulnoi could not reproduce. Already ahead, Li made her lead virtually unreachable by lifting 138 kg to set an Olympic record for total points and tying the clean and jerk one, again stealing these honors from Chen. Sirikaew attempted 140 kg in an attempt to break the clean and jerk Olympic record while Li attempted to break the world one with a 144 kg lift and, although both were unable to accomplish their feats, neither went home empty handed.
That was how the event and the results seemed to have ended. In 2015, however, the IOC began re-testing samples from the 2008 Beijing and 2012 London Olympics, using newer, more advanced testing techniques, in an effort to find those who had used performance enhancing drugs (PEDs), but in whom it could not be detected at the time of those Olympics. This was one of the many events affected. Every women’s weightlifting event at the 2012 London Olympics, except flyweight (≤ 48 kg), was affected by positive re-tests.
Original bronze medalist Yuliya Kalina (UKR) tested positive in July 2016 for turinabol (dehydrochloromethyltestosterone) and was disqualified, losing her bronze medal. It was re-assigned to original fourth-place finisher Rattikan Kulnoi of Thailand. The original fifth-place finisher, Boyanka Kostova of Azerbaijan, was disqualified in November 2016 after a re-test positive for both turinabol (dehydrochloromethyltestosterone) and stanozolol.

Silver went to Anaïs Chevalier-Bouchet from France (+9.4 seconds), and bronze was won by Norway’s Marte Olsbu Røiseland (+15.3).
With good wind conditions, the victory was decided by the performance on the shooting range and a perfect pacing on the difficult course. Herrmann, who had won a cross-country skiing medal at the 2014 Winter Games, had a reputation as a fast skier who was less stable on the shooting range. This event is frequently decided by the shooting, as one minute is added to the running time for every miss at the range. In the third round of shooting she missed the first target, but she was not discouraged and had a clean last shooting round, and a strong final round earned her the gold. It was Herrmann’s first Olympic medal in biathlon after one gold, three silver and one bronze at World Championships.
Chevalier-Bouchet also conceded just one penalty minute, but was about 10 seconds slower on the course. Top favourite Marte Olsbu Røiseland missed two targets and was not able to make up for the additional minute, although she was clearly the fastest skier. The best running time was achieved by 2021 World Cup winner Tiril Eckhoff. Five penalty minutes, however, brought her down to 22nd place. Ukraine’s Iryna Petrenko hit all 20 targets, but her skiing time was only good enough for an 11th place finish. A major surprise was Germany’s Vanessa Voigt in her first World Cup season. Her fourth place was a career-high in an individual event.

With skiers setting off at 30 second intervals, Maurice Manificat (FRA) took an early lead in the competition, leading at the first two intermediate markers, and would eventually finish sixth with a time of 34:27.4. Pietro Piller Cottrer (ITA), who had won the test event at the course some 12 months earlier, had been quoted as saying that the course was too easy, and as he skied into a lead with a time of 34:00.9, it looked as though he may win gold. However, out on the course Dario Cologna (SUI), who had won the 2009 Tour de Ski, was the leader at the final check point and took the lead with a time of 33:36.3, a time which would easily hold up for the gold medal, giving Switzerland its first ever gold in cross-country skiing. Bauer followed home in a time of 34:12.0 to take the bronze medal, narrowly defeating Marcus Hellner (SWE) who was always close to a medal spot on the course, but just faded at the end to finish 1.5 seconds behind Bauer. He would later win a pursuit gold in Vancouver. Finishing in 94th place was Roberto Carcelén, the first ever Winter Olympian from Peru.

Moreover, Genny Pagliaro of Italy, the 2013 and 2014 European champion, 2016 runner-up, and 2015 bronze medalist, was passed over in favor of younger weightlifters in other divisions for Italy’s weightlifting quota places, leaving the gold medal up for grabs. Vietnam’s Vương Thị Huyền and Japan’s Hiromi Miyake were the reigning World silver and bronze medalists and the only recent World or European medalists in the 48 kg to participate in Rio. Miyake was also the runner-up in 2012 and was taking part in her fourth edition of the Olympics.
In the snatch portion of the event, Vương failed to lift 83 kg in her first attempt, then 84 kg in her next two, and was therefore eliminated from contention. Miyake lifted 81 kg on her final try, but this left her well behind in a pack led by Sopita Tanasan of Thailand, who lifted 92 kg, 7 ahead of her nearest competitors, Sri Wahyuni Agustiani of Indonesia and Beatriz Pirón of the Dominican Republic. Tanasan had been competing in the flyweight for less than year, having previously been a featherweight competitor and a silver medalist in that category at the 2013 World Championships. She went on to win the clean and jerk portion of the event with a 108 kg lift, and her margin of victory in the snatch meant that she faced no serious challengers for the gold medal. Agustiani and Miyake both lifted 107 kg, giving them bronze and silver respectively after Pirón managed only 102 kg. Pirón’s fourth-place finish, however, was still her nation’s best-ever Olympic result in the sport.

An early-Olympic year favorite was Britain’s Zara Phillips, granddaughter of Queen Elizabeth II, and daughter of Mark Phillips, 1972 Olympian, and HRH Princess Anne, a 1976 Olympian. She had to withdraw when her horse Toytown was injured in training. In her absence there was no clear favorite. The leader after dressage was Australian Lucinda Fredericks, followed by Belgian Karin Donckers, and German Ingrid Klimke, the daughter of German dressage legend Reiner Klimke. Australian Shane Rose won the endurance ride, followed by Britains William Fox-Pitt, and German Hinrich Romeike. This moved Romeike into a narrow lead over Klimke by 0.5 points, with Australia’s Megan Jones only 0.8 points back.
As in 2004, the individual three-day jumping now consisted of two rounds, with only the top 25 riders on total score advancing to the final round, but with no more than three riders allowed from any nation.

Cook and Miles went clean in round two of jumping, as they had in the first round. This forced Romeike to ride cleanly, and he did in the second round to win a most surprising gold medal, with Miles taking silver, and Cook the bronze medal.

There were five pools. Inokuma, Rogers, and K’ik’nadze all won their pools comfortably, as did Kim Jong-Dai of Korea. Inokuma and Kim faced off in the only knock-out (quarter-final) match. Inokuma put Kim to the mat and held him down until Kim tapped submission, which was almost unheard of in that era. Rogers faced the second Soviet, Parnaoz Chik’viladze, in the first semi-final, with Rogers winning with yusei-gachi. In the second semi-final, Inokuma remembered his near defeat to K’ik’nadze and took no chances of allowing him to get his armlock hold.

The final was a dull affair, with little wrestling occurring for the first 10 minutes. The referee, Charles Palmer (GBR), warned both judoka, and threatened to disqualify both with neither getting a medal. The pace quickened a little, but not much.

The Canadians had the last three Olympic gold medals under their belt and were the 2012 world champions. The United States, meanwhile, were the 2011 and 2013 world champions. Below them in the rankings were Finland, Switzerland, Sweden, and Russia (who qualified as hosts), while Japan and Germany earned their tickets to the Games at the 2013 Olympic Qualification Tournament.
Responding to criticism that women’s hockey was not competitive enough, a format change was introduced wherein the top four teams were placed in Group A, while the remaining nations were sent to Group B. The top two teams from Group B would face the bottom two from Group A in the quarterfinals, while the bottom two of Group B were eliminated. This had several important ramifications. Firstly, the system succeeded in its intended effect and the double-digit shutouts or near-shutouts that characterized round robin play in 2010 were avoided; only one match was won by a margin greater than five goals. Secondly, Switzerland, who failed to win a single game in Group A, advanced to the final round and managed to progress to the semifinals by defeating Russia , the Group B winner. Perhaps most importantly, however, this new format meant that Canada and the United States met in the group stage at the Olympics for the first time since 1998, when there was only one main pool.
To no one’s surprise, Canada and the United States came out on top in their round robin pool, with Canada besting the Americans 3-2 in their match. Group B was won by Russia and Sweden, the latter of whom defeated Finland in the quarterfinals to meet the United States, against whom they lost 6-1. Switzerland, meanwhile, challenged Canada and held them to a 3-1 win, the smallest margin of victory for Canada against a non-American team at the Olympics. Determined to prove that this was no fluke, Switzerland defeated Sweden in the bronze medal match 4-3 (coming back from a 2-0 deficit), a considerable result for a nation that had failed to win a single match in the round robin and earned its first and only world championship medal, bronze, in 2012. It also became only the fifth nation (after the United States, Canada, Finland, and Sweden) to win an Olympic medal in women’s hockey.
The main matchup, however, was for the gold medal, and it went down as one of the best hockey matches – male or female – of all time. Unlike the 2010 Winter Olympics, which was decided in the first period, the 2014 edition was scoreless until over halfway into the second period, when Meghan Duggan of the United States drew first blood. The third period began poorly for the Canadians, who succumbed to Alex Carpenter (daughter of NHL standout Bobby Carpenter) after two minutes and, with less than five minutes to go, it seemed that the American victory was assured. In a surprising twist, however, Brianne Jenner and Marie-Philip Poulin undertook back-to-back drives (the latter with an empty Canadian net) and tied the game, drawing the two rival nations into sudden death overtime. After eight tense minutes, Poulin, who had secured Canada’s victory in Vancouver, repeated this feat in Sochi and scored during a brief interval of double power play. In less than 15 minutes, the Canadians had come back from certain defeat to dazzling victory and earned their 19th straight win in Olympic matches. Having also taken the curling tournament earlier in the day, Canada’s women celebrated their status as Olympic champions in both of their national winter sports. Hayley Wickenheiser and Jayna Hefford had additional cause to celebrate: not only were they participating in their fifth Olympics (having appeared in every women’s tournament since they began in 1998), but they also won their fifth Olympic medal, a record for either men’s or women’s hockey.  Caroline Ouellette, meanwhile, joined them in receiving a record fourth ice hockey gold medal (again, for men and women), having participated in every tournament since 2002.
In May 2016 WADA (World Anti-Doping Agency) commissioned a report, the McLaren Report, to look into allegations of systematic Russian doping and a cover-up to avoid positives at the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics. The report was released in two parts, in July and December 2016, and confirmed the allegations. In 2017 the IOC formed a commission to investigate this, headed by IOC Member Denis Oswald, and usually referred to as the Oswald Commission. In late October 2017 the Oswald Commission began to release its findings.
Although they finished only sixth originally, the Russian team was disqualified in December 2017 after eight separate members of the team – Inna Dyubanok, Yekaterina Lebedeva, Yekaterina Pashkevich, Anna Shibanova, Yekaterina Smolentseva, Galina Skiba, Tatyana Burina, and Anna Shchukina – were implicated in the Oswald Commission findings. However, after appeals to the Court of Arbitration for Sport, the sanctions against Lebedeva, Pashkevich, Burina, Shchukina, and Smolentseva were annulled, but the team remained disqualified because of the sanctions that were upheld.

Unsurprisingly Limbach was the number one seed in London.
The opening rounds of competition passed off rather uneventfully but the round of 16 heralded the start of a massacre of the top seeded combatants. Recently crowned European champion Aleksey Yakimenko of Russia, #3 seed Gu Bon-Gil of Korea and former Olympic champions Aldo Montano and Zhong Man were all eliminated in quick succession.
This left Limbach as an even clearer favourite for the Olympic title but his hopes only lasted as far as his next contest where he was upset by the third string Russian Nikolay Kovalyov.
The foil event in London saw the full emergence of Asia and Africa as new powers in the sport but sabre remained true to its European heartland and the final was played out between representatives of Hungary and Italy, traditionally two of the historic powerhouses of sabre fencing.
Áron Szilágyi of Hungary and Italian Diego Occhiuzzi had been successful as individuals but their major championship medals had mostly been achieved in team events. At #6 and #14 in the rankings few would have predicted they would face other for the gold medal in London.
As a contest the Olympic final was over by the half way stage. The Hungarian showed a dazzling turn of speed to win 8 of the first 9 points and, try as he might; Occhiuzzi was unable to claw back the deficit. Szilágyi’s win was the 13th victory for Hungary in the event but the first since the Barcelona Games of 1992.

He is now the first Armenian athlete in any sport to win multiple Olympic medals.
Aleksanyan did not give up a single point in his final three bouts from the quarter-finals onward and won back-to-back matches by technical fall in the quarter-finals and semi-finals, beating world number six Turkey’s Cenk İldem in the semi-finals.

Great Britain and New Zealand, the latter represented by Nathan Cohen and 2000 Olympic single scull champion Rob Waddell (who had tried his hand at sailing after the 2000 Games and returned to Olympic rowing in 2008), won the other two heats. These five nations then all succeeded in qualifying for the medal round in the semi-finals and were joined by 2007 World bronze medalists Tõnu Endrekson and Jüri Jaanson, the latter of whom was the 2004 Olympic runner-up in the single sculls and was competing in his sixth and last Olympics at the age of 42. In the final, the Australians took the lead from the start and never relinquished, winning the gold medal with ease. Great Britain looked to be right behind, but a fantastic push from the Estonians in the final quarter of the race saw them steal silver by a margin of only 0.05 seconds, leaving the stunned Britons with bronze. France and Slovenia, meanwhile, had a surprisingly poor race and finished far back in fifth and sixth respectively.

A blacksmith by trade, he had won the 1957 European amateur championship, and won the gold medal in this class by winning five decisions, although only winning his first bout unanimously. In the semi-finals he faced Britain’s Dick McTaggart, the defending gold medalist who was British champion in 1956, 1958, and 1960, and McTaggart gave him all he could handle, with Paździor winning by 3-2 judges’ decision. The final saw him face the hometown favorite, Sandro Lopopolo, but Paździor prevailed by majority decision. Paździor retired from boxing after 1961, winning 179 of 194 amateur bouts. He then studied to become an economist and worked as a boxing coach. McTaggart never turned professional, boxing as an amateur thru 1965, representing Britain again in 1964 at Tokyo, where he went out early, and winning the 1961 European lightweight title and five ABA titles in his career. But it was Lopopolo who had the best pro career in the ring. He turned professional in early 1961 and fought through 1973, finishing with a career record of 59 wins, 10 losses, and 7 draws. Lopopolo was world light-welterweight champion from April 1966 to April 1967.
Missing from the Games was Olli Maki, a Finn who was the reigning European champion at this weight and considered a gold medal prospect. Maki’s club was aligned with the Finnish Worker´s Sports Federation, which was in the middle of an internal political split and not on good terms with the Finnish Olympic Committee. He was nominated for Rome on the proviso that he resigned from his club and joined another in better standing with his NOC. Maki refused and turned professional at the end of 1960.

The Americans held out for the defending champion, their own Jim Lightbody, who had also been AAU champion in 1905.  All three qualified easily, Lightbody and Crabbe winning their heats, with McGough second to Crabbe.
In the finals, the pace was set by George Bonhag, who kept it quite slow, with Greg Wheatley second, Lightbody in 4th, and McGough 7th entering the last lap.  The two British favorites sat at the back of the pack, apparently unaware that Lightbody had barely finished second in a heat of the 400 to Nigel Barker, thus possessing great finishing speed.  With about 200 metres remaining, Lightbody took the lead and there was no chance for anyone to catch him.  McGough closed just as rapidly, however, to take second place.

The reigning World Champion was Isaquias Queiroz, who also took the silver medal at Rio in 2016. One of the other contenders was Sebastian Brendel of Germany, the two-time Olympic and four-time world champion in this distance. He had not been in his best form prior to the Games but was experienced enough to time his Olympic campaign to perfection. Another favourite was Martin Fuksa of Czech Republic, a World Championship silver medallist behind Brendel. The second Czech competitor was his younger brother, Petr.
On the first day in the preliminary heats, both Queiroz and Martin Fuksa won their races and qualified directly into the semi-finals. Brendel finished only third and had to start again in the quarter-finals. In the semi-finals Queiroz and Adrien Bart of France, the bronze medallist from the 2019 World Championship, won their races. Brendel finished seventh and could not qualify for the A Final. In the A Final, Queiroz and Liu Hao of China were pacing each other in the first quarter of the race, but the Brazilian broke away in the last 250 metres and finished first. Liu came in second behind Queiroz, while Serghei Tarnovschi from the Republic of Moldova came from behind and overtook Bart in the final second to finish third. Five years before, Tarnovschi finished third as well, but due to a positive doping test, his result was deleted and he was sentenced to a four-year ban in 2017. 
After winning two silvers and a bronze in Rio, Queiroz finally won the first gold medal for Brazil. He dedicated his victory to his former coach, who died of a brain tumour in 2018.

The 2003 and 2007 World Cup champion Germany failed to qualify for the Olympics, but the most recent winner, Japan, did make the cut. Other favorites included Brazil, arguably featuring the best female player in the world (Marta), and France.
The tournament got off to a bad start, as the pool match between North Korea and Colombia was delayed for an hour. The South Korean flag had been displayed next to one of the North Korean players during the team introduction, causing the entire team to march off until the issue was rectified. All favored teams proceed to the quarter-finals, although Japan had failed to impress, drawing 0-0 in two of its matches. Great Britain proved a surprise, winning their group ahead of Brazil, but the hosts were ousted by Canada in the quarter-finals. The US and France also proceeded, while Japan knocked out Brazil, 2-0.
The Japanese women proceeded into the final after a 2-1 victory over France. The other semi was more of a battle. Canada’s Christine Sinclair put her team ahead three times, each time seeing the Americans draw level, the third time when Abby Wambach converted her penalty given over a disputed handball call. Wambach’s goal was her 158th international goal, equalling the record held by former American star Mia Hamm. The two teams had nearly finished the second half of overtime when Alex Morgan headed in a cross from Heather O’Reilly, a full four minutes into added time. The Canadians later found redemption by claiming the bronze medal against France.
As in the 2011 World Cup final, the US and Japan were evenly matched. The Americans closed out an opening offensive with a goal from Carli Lloyd after just 8 minutes. The Japanese then came close to scoring, but US goalkeeper Hope Solo, the woodwork and a non-allowed penalty kept them from doing so. A few minutes into the second half, Lloyd fired a long-distance shot to double the advantage. Shortly after, Yuki Ogimi finally scored. Solo (save) and Amy LePeilbet (line clearance) then kept the US goal clear, holding on to win the team’s fourth gold in five Olympics.

Cheered on by a “Go Tutankhamen” yell from the Dutch spectators, the Egyptians had surprisingly beaten Turkey and Portugal, but they were no match for the Argentinians, and lost 0-6. Italy then thrashed them 11-3 in the bronze medal match. The final between Uruguay and Argentina was not as attractive as expected, and after 90 minutes and 30 minutes of extra time, both teams had only managed to score once. The replay saw Uruguay dominate the match in the first half, which nevertheless ended in 1-1. Despite playing a very offensive second half, the Argentine had to concede the tournament-winning goal in the 68th minute. Two Argentine players, Raimundo Orsi and Luis Felipe Monti would win the World Cup in 1934, playing for Italy.

Including Peirsol, the last four titles in this event had been won by Americans who were led in London by Matt Grevers, the 2008 silver medalist behind Peirsol.
The final turned into a battle between Lacourt and Grevers with Lacourt leading at the turn in 25.31, actually ahead of Peirsol’s world-record split, but he could not maintain that pace and Grevers came on strong to win in an Olympic record 52.16, the fastest ever textile time. It was the fifth straight gold medal for the United States in the event and came only a few minutes after Missy Franklin had won the women’s 100 back. Lacourt fell apart in the closing metres of the race, dropping off the podium to fourth place, as the silver went to American Nick Thoman in 52.92, with Japan’s Ryosuke Irie winning bronze in 52.97.

Friesinger, the defending Olympic Champion, had won the world title in 2001, 2003 and 2004 and was runner-up in 2005. She had also taken the 1500 m World Cup in 2003. Klassen had taken the World Cup in 2004 and 2005, also winning the 2005 World Championships. In 2005, the women had been exchanging the World Record set by Friesinger during her Olympic victory in 2002. First bettered by Klassen in January, she again lowered it in October, only to be beaten by Friesinger a week later. At the World Cup in Salt Lake City, Klassen then took it back, setting a staggering 1:51.79.
Interestingly, the two top contenders were drawn in the same pair. At the time they took to the ice, the leading time had been set by Kristina Groves of Canada, 1:56.74, better than Friesinger’s pre-Games rink record. Klassen took off with an insane pace, leaving Friesinger well behind. She managed to come back a little in the first full lap, but this effort cost her too much, and she had to let Klassen go. The Canadian finished almost 1½ seconds ahead of the leading time with 1:55.27, while beating Friesinger by a full two seconds. In the final pair, 3000 m winner Ireen Wüst managed to edge ahead of Friesinger for a bronze medal, leaving Klassen and Groves a 1-2 Canadian victory.

In his absence there was no clear favorite. The best sprinter since Rio had been American Christian Coleman, who won the 2019 World Championship, but he fell afoul of whereabouts failures and was subject to a doping penalty, which kept him out of Tokyo.
The slight favorite for this event, per Track & Field News, was American Trayvon Bromell, who was coming back from injuries and had won the US Olympic Trials. Also considered were another USA sprinter, Ronnie Baker, runner-up to Bromell at the Trials, and Canadian Andre De Grasse, also returning from sub-par years, but De Grasse had won bronze in this event at Rio, along with a silver in the 200.
Bromell did not produce at Tokyo, and failed to make the final. Baker and De Grasse qualified, with Baker considered a slight favorite. Baker led the final through the first 50 metres, but at that point was caught by the American-born Italian Lamont Marcell Jacobs. Jacobs moved ahead, pushed by another US runner, Fred Kerley who, until 2021, had been primarily a 400 metre specialist.
De Grasse had started poorly out in lane 9, but started closing, but Jacobs could not be headed, and the Italian took the gold medal over Kerley, with De Grasse repeating his bronze medal from Rio, as Baker fell back to fifth place.
Jacobs was not a complete unknown as some in the media made him out to be, as TAFNews ranked him fifth in their pre-Olympic predictions but the victory was still an upset. Jacobs was born of an Italian-mother and an American soldier, and was raised initially in Texas, but when his father was re-assigned to Korea, Lamont and his mother returned to Italy and he rarely saw his father again.

With defending Olympic champion Pål Tyldum also on the team Norway hoped for revenge, but they feared the Soviet skiers, and also the reigning World Champion, East German Gerhard Grimmer, who was counted as a major contender for the gold.
At 10 km, the 24-year old Soviet Vasily Rochev, bronze medalist in 15 km at the 1974 World Championship, had taken the lead, 13 seconds ahead of Sven-Åke  Lundbäck from Sweden, 1972 Olympic Champion in the 15 km. At the halfway point, the amazing American Bill Koch, skiing his first ever 50 km in competition, had advanced from fourth to the top of the leaderboard, 8 seconds ahead of East Germany’s Gert-Dietmar Klause. Formo followed in third place, while Rochev had dropped down to fourth. Now Formo started his move. At the 40 km intermediate mark, he was in the lead, 32 seconds ahead of Klause. Rochev was now in third, still in contention for a medal, but he was closely followed by the steadily advancing Swede Benny Södergren, the youngster Koch and World Champion Grimmer. Over the last 10 km, Rochev and Koch faded badly, losing five minutes more to the leaders and dropped down to 12th and 13th place in the final results. Formo ran a perfect calculated race, finished fastest of all and restored Norwegian cross-country pride with a gold medal, Norway being the first nation to win the 50 km at three consecutive Winter Olympics. Klause was a clear second, and Södergren’s well paced finish earned Sweden their only Nordic skiing medal at the 1976 winter Olympics. The best Soviet skier, Ivan Garanin had advanced steadily over the last part of the race and ended as fourth, a minute too late to secure a medal.

The Soviet Union, in particular, was now considered a formidable obstacle to another American gold medal.  They had won the European Championship in both 1965 and 1967, and the World Championship in 1967, with the United States finishing only 4th at the Worlds.  Yugoslavia also had an excellent team, and had finished second to the USSR at the 1965 Europeans and the 1967 World Championship.  Further, the Americans were hampered domestically by calls for a boycott of the Olympics by African-American athletes.  While this never materialized, the two best US collegiate players, Lew Alcindor (later Kareem Abdul-Jabaar) and Elvin Hayes, did not try to play for the 1968 US Olympic team.
At Mexico City, the US was led by future professional stars Spencer Haywood and Jo-Jo White.  The USA narrowly defeated Puerto Rico by only 5 points in a preliminary round game, and then made it to the final by defeating Brazil 75-63.  There it faced Yugoslavia, which had defeated the Soviet Union in the other semi-final.

His replacement on the Soviet team was Belarussian Vyacheslav Yanovsky, who was also of a high calibre and had won the World Cup and also reached the final of the European Championships. Borislav Abadzhiev of Bulgaria, who had defeated Yanovsky to win the European title, made little impression in Seoul and was eliminated in his first bout.
Another bizarre chapter in the ongoing animosity between Korean and American boxers was enacted in the third round. For most of the tournament two rings were used concurrently with a bell used to denote the start and end of each round in one ring and a buzzer used in the other.  The bout was held in the ring which used the buzzer but shortly before the end of the first round between Todd Foster and Jeon Jin-Cheol the Korean relaxed and turned to go to his corner when he heard the bell used in the other ring being rung. Foster realized Jeon’s error and rushed at him, landing a left hook to the face. The Korean dropped to the canvas, some said in a deliberate attempt to get his opponent disqualified, but the referee began to count before changing his mind and consulting with his fellow officials. After frantic deliberations it was decided to call the fight a )no-contest) and restage the bout the following day. The rematch was a dramatic one and Foster dropped his opponent in the opening seconds and though the Korean fought back gamely, the American knocked him out in round two.
Foster’s success was short-lived and he lost in an upset to Australia’s Grahame Cheney in the next round. Cheney built on this to become Australia’s first boxing finalist since the London Games of 1908. Try as he might Cheney could not match the expertise of Yanovsky in the final, who won the 14th and last of the Soviet Union’s Olympic boxing titles. At the relatively advanced age of 33 Yanovsky decided to embark on a professional career. He won all but two of his 32 contests and won national titles in Russia, Japan and Germany but never challenged for a global title.

Another feared opponent was Canada’s Isabelle Charest, who held the world record in the event, having set it at 44.867 during the 1997 World Championships.
Of these favorites, only Charest actually made the final. Yang Yang (A) was disqualified in the quarter-finals, and Jeon was outpaced in the semis. This left Charest as the overwhelming favorite, but she could not deliver. During the race, she hit her opponent Wang Chunlu’s skate, causing them both to fall. Charest was disqualified, while Wang stormed off the ice in anger, after failing to finish the race. This left only two racers, Annie Perreault, another Canadian, and Yang Yang (S). The two finished close, with Perreault securing a gold medal for Canada. Because there were only two ranked skaters in the final, the bronze medal went to the winner of the B Final. Jeon had won that race comfortably, giving her a consolation medal.

If it was supposed to be cooler, Sapporo had not heard that rumor as the morning of the women’s marathon had a wet-bulb temperature of 31° C. (88° F.) and a dew point of 20° C. (72° F.).
With the COVID pandemic none of the women’s marathon majors had been held yet in 2021 so picking favorites was difficult. Kenyan runners were expected to be dominant, however, led by Peres Jepchirchir, Brigid Kosgei, and Ruth Chepngetich.
With the heat the early pace was slow, as expected. The halfway point was reached only in 1-15:14, with 12 runners together in the lead. Chepngetich fell off the pace just before 30 km and would not finish. There were seven runners still together with 10 km remaining.

She had won the 1,500 m at most of these competitions, though not at the 1994 Europeans, which were held on the Olympic ice. She had, however, won all World Cup races in the event during the season, and sported a silver medal from Albertville 1992. The women who had beaten her earlier in Hamar was Emese Hunyady, a native Hungarian who had married an Austrian man to escape her communist home country. With Niemann’s confidence damaged after her fall in the Olympic 3,000 m, Hunyady hoped to repeat that win at the Olympics.
Niemann skated in the first pair against the winner of the 3,000 m, Svetlana Bazhanova. She beat the Russian woman this time, but her final time of 2:03.41 was a second slower than she had been at the same rink in January, and 1.6 seconds slower than she had been at the December World Cup. That this time was beatable was quickly proven by Bonnie Blair, already winner of the 500 m. Not known for her 1,500 ms, she approached Niemann’s leading time by 0.03 seconds. Then it was Hunyady’s turn. The former figure skater started out with a 4-tenths advantage, and then slowly expanded her lead to win in 2:02.19. That time would remain unbeaten for the rest of the competition, earning Austria its first Olympic title in speed skating. For Niemann, matters became worse when another skater also beat her time. Gynecology student Svetlana Fedotkina was considered an outsider for a medal, and delivered on that promise. With a very fast start, she built up a half-second gap to Hunyady at the bell. She lost a full second in that last lap, but her 2:02.69 was enough for silver. Later, her Olympic performance became somewhat tainted: in January 1996 she was caught for doping use and suspended for two years.

His greatest rival was Russia’s Denis Tsargush, two-time World (2009 and 2010) and three-time European Champion (2010-2012) in the category. Another strong challenger was Sadegh Goudarzi of Iran, the Asian Champion in 2009 and 2012 and World Championship runner-up the past two years.
Burroughs and Tsargush were drawn in the same half, where the American edged out the Russian in the semi-finals, while Goudarzi was the winner of his bracket and advanced to challenge the World Champion in the gold medal match. Both wrestlers were extremely agile fighters, but Borroughs was quicker in each round, ably dodging all of the Iranians attacks and scoring in the final seconds of both rounds to win the United States’ first wrestling gold medal of the Games.
Of the two wrestlers who met in the first bronze medal match, Soslan Tigiyev of Uzbekistan was the more heralded, having won a silver medal at the 2008 Games and bronze at the 2006 Asian Games. His opponent, Gábor Hatos of Hungary, had finished 15th at the 2004 edition and had bronze medals from the 2006 European Championships and the 2010 World Championships. Tigiyev won the first round with a takedown and drew the advantaged position in a second round par terre, which he was able to convert not only to a point, but a bronze medal as well. For the final podium spot Tsargush faced Matt Gentry of Canada, a Pan American bronze medalist in 2007 and 2011 who finished 18th at the 2008 Olympics.

Racing in the B-final, they broke the world record and then watched from the side as two teams were disqualified from the final, leaving them the bronze. One of these team members was Lara van Ruijven. In 2019, she would become the first Dutchwoman to win an individual world title (in the 500 m), but a year later would make the news for a much sadder reason.
On 25 June 2020, during a training camp near Font-Romeu, Van Ruijven fell ill with an autoimmune disease and was transported to hospital. Despite being placed in a medically-induced coma and undergoing surgery, the 27-year-old passed away on 10 July in Perpignan. The Dutch team, obviously hit hard by this event, commemorated their teammate in the coming seasons by wearing small hearts on their suits with a panther skin motif, referring to her nickname within the team, “Panther Lara”.
The Dutch relay team was intent on making the best tribute to Van Ruijven by claiming the Olympic gold in Beijing. With two-time Olympic champion Schulting in their midst, as well as the 2021 world title under their belt, this was no pipe dream, either. They were able to comfortably race their semi-final along with China, as Poland was outpowered and Italy, with star skater Arianna Fontana, eliminated themselves with a fall. The other semi-final was much more closely contested, with all four teams finishing within 0.2 seconds, and with six-time champion Korea and seven-time medalist Canada coming out on top.
The Dutch quartet controlled most of the final. With 10 laps left, Qu Chunyu made great use of an exchange to pass Xandra Velzeboer on the inside, with Korea following suit. Velzeboer then immediately restored the previous order by overtaking both on the outside and using that speed to open up a small gap. The other three nations needed five laps to close the gap again, only for Velzeboer to re-open it again. Schulting then brought it home for the gold, as Korea emerged victorious over China and Canada.
As the four Dutch skaters entered the podium for the flower ceremony after the race, the four cheered to celebrate their gold medal – then all blew a kiss to the sky to thank Lara van Ruijven who, in their words, “had been cheering them on from the sky”.

America’s Greg Barton was the reigning World and Pan-American Champion, as well as the 1984 Olympic bronze medalist, while New Zealand’s Alan Thompson was the defending Olympic champion. Barton and Csipes won their opening heats, while Thompson was fourth in a heat won by Gunnar Olsson of Sweden and advanced only through the repêchage. Barton and Olsson again won their heats in the semi-finals, while East Germany’s André Wohllebe defeated Csipes and helped eliminate Thompson in a third heat. Csipes led the race for most of the course, with Australia’s Grant Davies putting forth a surprisingly strong effort to remain at his side, but he struggled in the final stretch and faded all the way to the back of the pack. Barton, meanwhile, had unleashed a powerful drive and passed Davies to win by the slimmest of margins: 0.01 seconds. This was the United States’ first Olympic gold medal in canoeing since Frank Havens’ victory in the C-1 10000 in 1952. The Australian thus settled for silver, while Wohllebe took bronze 0.27 seconds later. Barton would become a double Olympic champion later that day by winning the K-2 1000, while Wohllebe would take another bronze medal in the K-4 1000.

Ties were broken by a Subsequent Majority rule, i.e., if the skaters were ranked for the same position by the same number of judges, Majority Placement for the next higher position for each skater determined who was ranked higher.  Final placement was determined by factored placements.  The tiebreakers were then 1) Number of Majority Placements, 2) Total Ordinals of Majority, 3) Total Ordinals.  The placement for the Short Program was factored by 0.5 (33.3%), and the placement for Free Skating was factored by 1.0 (66.7%).  The sums of the factored placements were then used to determine final placement, with the Free Skating being the tiebreaker.",na,"Since the 1988 Winter Olympics, Kurt Browning had established himself as the best male skater in the world. He was World Champion in 1989-91 and won numerous other international competitions. But he was hampered by a back injury in Albertville and was not at his best. The short program was won by Viktor Petrenko with Browning only in fourth place. Petrenko had been runner-up to Browning at the 1990-91 Worlds. Petrenko skated steadily in the free program, winning that phase as well to secure the gold medal, becoming the first Soviet man to win a singles gold medal. The silver medal went to American Paul Wylie, who had never been on the podium before in a major international event. He won the silver based on the cleanest free skate. Bronze medalist Petr Barna (CZE) successfully landed a quadruple jump, the first time this had been performed at the Olympics. Petrenko would also win the Worlds in 1992, but Kurt Browning came back in 1993 to again win that title.

As the defending Olympic champion, and with the addition of the hometown advantage, Pendleton was clearly the rider to beat in the event, although Meares would provide a significant challenge, having won the silver medal in Beijing.
In the qualification round Pendleton set an Olympic record time of 10.724, before going on to dominate her opponents in the next three stages of the event. Meares breezed through all of her rounds as well, thus setting up the final as a repeat of the 2008 showdown. Their first race was controversial: Pendleton won the outstanding sprint to the finish by one-thousandth of a second – the width of a tire – but was relegated for swerving out of her lane in the final stretch of her triumph. The British team argued that Pendleton had only crossed the line in response to be touched by Meares’ elbow, but the call stood and the Briton was considered to have lost the race. It was the second time Pendleton had been relegated to a losing position, after the British team had been denied an opportunity to compete for a gold medal in the team sprint. The second race, however, was uncontroversial – Meares won with a significant margin after a superbly technical race, thus dethroning the Olympic champion and claiming the title that many Britons felt was owed to the retiring Pendleton in her last race. In the bronze medal match Guo Shuang of China defeated Kristina Vogel of Germany to repeat her third-place performance from the 2008 Games.

In 1983 he had also starred in the film The Lords of Discipline in which he played the first black man to attend a southern military college in the 1960s.

Before the start of the race there was a big discussion about the status of the participants in Nordic Combined, starting in the same race. At the end it was decided that the same athlete could participate both in 18 km and Nordic Combined.
Norway then decided to enter Thorleif Haug and Johan Grøttumsbraaten in both events, Jon Mårdalen and Einar Landvik only for the 18 km, and Thoralf Strømstad and Harald Økern only for the Nordic Combined. 17 of the 30 participants in Nordic combined were entered for both events. One of the competitors entered for 18 km only, Landvik, could certainly have taken a medal in Nordic combined. He placed 5th in both the 18 km and the Ski Jumping, but there was no place for him in the Norwegian team for Nordic Combined!
In those days no intermediate times were taken during the race, and for some time it looked like a Finnish day. Tapani Niku with an early start had the best finishing time ahead of Landvik and Per-Erik Hedlund, until Grøttumsbraaten bettered Niku’s time with 35 seconds. 4 minutes later Haug crossed the finishing line 1.20 better than Grøttumsbraaten and secured his second gold in 3 days. Another great day for the Norwegians, with all 4 participants placing among the 5 best.

The team all-around was contested first, with the top 36 finishers from that event advancing to the individual all-around final. However, to prevent individual nations from dominating with over-representation, no more than three gymnasts from any one country could advance to the individual final. The total score consisted of 50% of the team all-around score and the performances on all four apparatuses in the individual final. The defending champion was Nadia Comăneci, but there were chinks in her armor by 1980, as she had not won the World Championships in either 1978 or 1979 due to injury. The favorite in early 1980 was likely Soviet Yelena Mukhina who was the 1978 World Champion, missing the 1979 meet due to a broken leg. Sadly, a few weeks before the Moskva Olympics, Mukhina fell while training on floor exercise, broke her neck, and was rendered quadriplegic permanently. She would eventually die in 2006.
The contest for gold was very close between Comăneci, Soviet Yelena Davydova, and East German Maxi Gnauck. It all came down to the last rotation, with Gnauck leading but her vault scored only 9.70 points. Davydova then scored 9.95 on beam, and was followed by Comăneci on the same apparatus. She made a small stepback on landing, and it looked unlikely she would get the 9.95 she needed to win gold. The head judge was Romanian Marian Simionescu who disagreed with the judges’ scores and tried to get them to change them, arguing for 28 minutes before her complaint was disallowed. Simionescu refused to punch the final score into the computer which was done by a Soviet official while Simionescu continued her tirade. The 9.85 score gave Davydova the gold medal with Gnauck and Comăneci sharing silver.
This and the team all-around were Davydova’s only gold medals in Moskva, but she added a silver on beam in her only Olympics. Comăneci would win gold medals in 1980 on floor and beam, and ended her Olympic career with nine medals and five gold medals.

Ledecky went out ahead of world record pace for 200 metres, with Adlington and Friis trying to hang on. By 600 metres she had moved two bodylengths in front and had only to hold on for the gold medal.

Koss, who was also the world record holder, was up against his compatriot Kjell Storelid (silver in the 5,000), defending champion Bart Veldkamp and the other Dutchmen (Falko Zandstra and Rintje Ritsma), as well as Poland’s Jaromir Radke, who had surprised with a third place at the European Championships, earlier that year at the Olympic venue.
Koss was the first of the favorites to race - and he essentially ended the competition. Like in the 5,000 metres, Koss produced an incredibly flat pace and ended in 13:30.55, breaking his own world record by 13 seconds. Of the remaining contenders, some tried to attack Koss’s times. Veldkamp had to let go of the schedule after 3K, Ritsma even sooner. Zandstra, Radke and Storelid didn’t seriously attack Koss’ times, but instead gunned for the medals. Storelid managed this best, winning his second silver of the Games after slipping below Veldkamp’s times in the final five rounds. Veldkamp held on for bronze, but he wasn’t there to see it. Thoroughly disappointed in his own performance, he had left the stadium and needed to be brought back before the medal ceremony could take place.
Koss’ time was not approached until the advent of the clap skate allowed skaters to go faster, with Gianni Romme breaking it at the 1998 Olympics. It also earned him the 1994 Oscar Mathisen Award for outstanding speed skating performance, and he was named Sports Illustrated Sportsman of the Year (together with Bonnie Blair).

Yu was one of the defending Olympic champions and a two-time reigning World Champion; in 2008 and 2010 her partner had been Du Jing but, for the 2011 World Championships, she had joined with Wang, a runner-up from the 2010 edition. China also had the number two seed of Tian Qing and Zhao Yunlei, who had been the runners-up in 2011. South Korea’s Ha Jeong-Eun and Kim Min-Jeong and Japan’s Mizuki Fujii and Reika Kakiiwa, who ranked third and fourth in the world respectively, were also top prospects to challenge for the podium.
In perhaps the most publicized controversy of the 2012 Games, Wang and Yu were booed off the court after what appeared to be an intentional loss to Jeong Gyeong-Eun and Kim Ha-Na of South Korea during the group stage. Losing the match ensured that Wang and Yu would avoid meeting their compatriots Tian and Zhao until the final and guaranteed China the top two podium spots should each team win their quarter and semi-finals. In the ranking-deciding match of another pool, both Ha and Kim and their Indonesian opponents Greysia Polii and Meiliana Jauhari also seemed to be intentionally losing points in an effort to fix the match. Following a review by the Badminton World Federation, all eight players were disqualified from the Games for “not using one’s best efforts to win a match” and “conducting oneself in a manner that is clearly abusive or detrimental to the sport” and were replaced in the final brackets by the third and fourth-place finishers of their pools. Some felt that this decision was overly harsh, considering that the competitors’ strategy had been a long-term one, seeking to place themselves in the best position to win the tournament at the cost of a single match. Others argued that the players were punished for a faulty rule system that incentivized such behavior and questioned the decision to allow teams that had not yet won a single match to compete for a medal. Most, however, agreed that, above all, the match-fixing went against the competitive spirit of sport and had sullied badminton’s reputation on the international scene. With further punishment left to the national governing bodies of the sport, the South Koreans were banned from all national and international competition for two years (later reduced to six months) while their coaches received a lifetime ban (later reduced to two years). Polii and Jauhari received four month bans while Yu Yang retired mere hours after being disqualified.
With two of the best teams out of contention, Tian and Zhao and Fuijii and Kakiiwa easily survived to the finals, where the Chinese squad emerged victorious 21-10, 25-23. The bronze medal match was fought between the Russian duo of Valeriya Sorokina and Nina Vislova and the Canadians Alex Bruce and Michele Li, who had been the third and fourth-place finishers respectively in the pool originally won by Jeong and Kim. Having lost to the Russians in the group stage 8-21, 10-21, Bruce and Li made a surprising comeback by defeating the Australian duo of Leanne Choo and Renuga Veeran 21-9, 18-21, 21-18 and putting up a valiant effort against the Japanese team in a 12-21, 21-19, 13-21 loss. They were only able to improve their performance against the Russians marginally in the bronze medal match, however, losing 9-21, 10-21.

She had already won gold in the 200 free, the 400 free, and anchored the USA to gold in the 4x200 free relay, so she was obviously in good form. The only major question was how fast she could swim. The world record of 8:06.68, which she held, was felt to have no shelf life, but what was possible for her – 8:04, 8:03, 8:02? The only other question was who would get the other medals.
In the prelims Ledecky posted 8:12.86, winning the heat by over 6½ seconds. In the final, if there was any doubt at all of her dominance, it was over by 100 metres, as she led Britain’s Jazz Carlin by almost two seconds. That lead was increased at each split, eventually winning in a world record 8:04.79, besting Carlin by 11.38 seconds, the largest margin in the event since Debbie Meyer won by 11.7 seconds in 1968, the first time it was held at the Olympics.
Ledecky’s 200-400-800 triple matched the feat of Meyer, who won the same events in 1968. Her four gold medals in Rio had been previously done, among women, by Kornelia Ender in 1976, Amy Van Dyken in 1996, and Missy Franklin in 2012, all trailing the six golds won by Kristin Otto in 1988. Her three individual golds made her the eighth woman to achieve this at one Olympics in swimming, also trailing Otto, who won four in 1988.

The first semi-final pitted the tournament favourite, Albert Pakeyev of Russia who had  won the European Championship earlier in the year and the 4-time Cuban champion Maikro Romero.  Romero proved the better man and won a clear points decision. The second semi was a rematch of the previous year’s World Championships final between Germany’s Zoltan Lunka and Bolat Zhumadilov of Kazakhstan.  Lunka could not repeat his victory of 1995 and the Kazakh progressed to become his nation’s first Olympic boxing finalist.  For the first two rounds of the final it appeared that the more mobile Zhumadilov was well on his way to the Olympic title and he led 8-5 as they entered the final three minutes of the bout. Sensing that the Kazakh was now tiring, Romero put everything he could into the final bout and with a flurry of two handed attacks pulled the score line back in his favour as they approached the final 30 seconds. At the final bell Romero held a solitary point advantage but it was enough to him to become the first Cuban Olympic champion in this weight division.

To obtain a fourth semi-finalist, the losers in the pools could advance via a repêchage pool. The heavy favorite was Anton Geesink, the Dutchman who was World Champion in 1961 and 1964. The Japanese had chosen Akio Kaminaga to carry their hopes. Kaminaga was near the end of his career, but had been runner-up at the World Championships in 1958. Geesink and Kaminaga were unfortunately drawn in the same pool, and Geesink defeated him by decision. As expected, Kaminaga came through the losers’ pool. In the semi-finals Geesink faced Theodore Boronovskis (AUS), who yielded to a 12-second win by sasae-tsuri-komi-ashi. Kaminaga won the other semi-final over the German, Klaus Glahn, in 4:10 via tai-otoshi. The final was the one everyone had wanted – Geesink against Kaminaga. As the match started, the Japanese coaches were so intense that they leaned against the edge of the mat, drawing a caution from the referee. The match was close for nine minutes, when Kaminaga went for tai-otoshi, only to have Geesink counter with uranage, and threw the Japanese to the mat, and applied a basic hold, kesa-gatame. A few seconds later, the referee signaled ippon, and Geesink had his gold medal. Geesink would later spend a brief time in Japan, where he became very popular, as a professional wrestler, and in 1965, he played Samson in an Italian biblical movie. He was eventually elected an IOC Member.

As in the days before, wind was still a factor and the start of the downhill phase was lowered for safety reasons, cutting the race short by about 20 seconds. The course was also changed slightly to not so windy parts and avoiding big jumps. The remaining course was more like a Super G, with gusty winds.
The reigning World Champion was Luca Aerni, who won the title at St. Moritz in 2017. He dethroned Austrian Marcel Hirscher, who finished second by 1/100th of a second, after winning gold in 2015. The Frenchman Alexis Pinturault won the Combined Crystal Globe in 2016 and 2017 and won five out of the last nine World Cup Combined events, but had never won a medal in this event at the World Championships or Olympics. In the years 2014 and 2015 no Crystal Globe was awarded, but the scoring was topped by Ted Ligety/Pinturault (shared in 2014) and Carlo Janka. The only two Alpine Combined events held during this World Cup season were won by Pinturault in Bormio and by Victor Muffat-Jeandet in Wengen, but the Crystal Globe was won by Italian Peter Fill, who was able to finish second (Bormio) and third (Wengen). The gold medalist from Sochi Sandro Viletta was not able to participate in PyeongChang, as he tore his right ACL in December 2016 and never fully recovered. The silver medalist from four years ago Ivica Kostelić retired in January 2017, with only the bronze medalist Christof Innerhofer returning to the Olympics. Still present at this Games was the gold medalist from 2006, Ted Ligety.
The downhill phase started as scheduled at 1130 with sunshine and blue skies, but with swirling winds and the temperature at -11° C. Thomas Dreßen, wearing bib #1, set the fastest time and the best slalom racer, Hirscher, with bib #2, also raced well. Both took the advantage of an early start as the gusts whipped up during a 15-minute delay after the crash of bib #3 Pavel Trikhichev. Also in a good position was Pinturault, finishing 10th and 0.28 seconds ahead of Hirscher.
To give more balance the slalom part was shortened by 10 gates. Muffat-Jeandet set the early pace and took the lead. Ligety, Marco Schwarz, and Thomas Mermillod-Blondin all finished right behind the Frenchman. It was Hirscher who took over the lead from Muffat-Jeandet and also bettered his slalom race time by 1/100th of a second. Two racers later, Pinturault settled in second place and the podium stood. At the end of the result list Albin Tahiri from Kosovo finished in 37th and last position, but made history by becoming the first ever Winter Olympic competitor for his country.
After six Overall World Cup titles and six gold medals at World Championships, Hirscher won his first Olympic gold at his third Games. For Austria it was the first men’s Combined gold medal since Mario Reiter won gold in Nagano 20 years ago and, for France, it was the first men’s Combined medals after 70 years, when Henri Oreiller and James Couttet won gold and bronze at St. Moritz in 1948. Hirscher raced Atomic, Pinturault won silver with Head skis, and Muffat-Jeandet used Salomon.

The final was held on a very hot day and four of the 15 qualifiers did not start.  Hannes Kolehmainen took the lead on the second lap and eventually dropped the field by the sixth lap.  He eventually ran uncontested to win by over 45 seconds.  The silver medal went to Lewis Tewanima, a Hopi Indian and Jim Thorpe’s teammate at the Carlisle Indian School.
Hannes Kolehmainen’s winning time was “somewhat” of a world record.  At the beginning of 1912 there was no official world record, as the IAAF did not start recognizing marks until 1913.  Until 1911, the best mark on record by an amateur was 31:40.0 by Walter George (GBR), set in London on 28 July 1884 during a 12-mile handicap race.  The professional best had been set by Alfred Shrubb (GBR) in Glasgow on 5 November 1904 during a one-hour race.  But on 16 November 1911, Jean Bouin ran 30:58.8 at Colombes, France.  Bouin did not run the 10K at Stockholm but finished a very close second to Hannes Kolehmainen in the 5K.
When the IAAF began to recognize world records, they thought that Bouin had run his mark in 1913.  They recognized only Kolehmainen’s winning Stockholm time as the initial IAAF-approved world record.  Bouin’s mark did not receive official recognition until 1926.

He began running the marathon seriously in 2005, and in September 2007 had broken the world record with 2-04:26 in Berlin. But he opted out of the marathon in Beijing, concerned about air quality and its possible deleterious effects on his health. This left the race wide open. The day of the race saw temperatures of 24° C. (77° F.) and high humidity, negating chances for a fast time. Kenyan Samuel Wanjiru knew the heat would make fast times difficult but had trained in the heat in Japan and was determined to set a very fast pace. He went to the lead immediately, passing 5K in 14:52, and many of the lead runners would not go with him, thinking the pace was too fast for the conditions. Wanjiru eased slightly after the opening 5K but ran in the lead throughout. At the halfway mark, he had cut the lead pack to only five runners – Yonas Kifle (ERI), Deriba Merga (ETH), Martin Lel (KEN), and Moroccan Jaouad Gharib. After 30K, only Gharib could stay with Wanjiru. But at 35K, they shared a water bottle, and Wanjiru then put the hammer down to drop Gharib, eventually winning by 44 seconds in 2-06:32, considered stunning in the heat.

With just two kilometers to go his compatriot Daniel Richardsson was in front, but no one managed to gain a decisive lead. Double gold medalist Dario Cologna from Switzerland, who could be seen close to the vanguard throughout the race, was the unlucky fellow on the day, breaking his ski while in fourth place with less than two kilometers to go. The race was effectively decided on the last climb, where the Russians showed their strength. A four-man group of three Russians, Aleksandr Legkov, Maksim Vylegzhanin and Ilya Chernousov, and Norway’s Martin Johnsrud Sundby entered the stadium clear of the field. With the end almost in sight Legkov overtook Vylegzhanin to move into the pole position and held it to the finish. In a close sprint to the line Vylegzhanin just held on for the silver medal ahead of compatriot Chernousov in a photo finish. Sundby missed out on a medal, finishing just one second behind the winner.
It was the first time in 78 years that athletes from one country achieved a clean sweep in this event; the last time was by Sweden at Garmisch-Partenkirchen. Legkov had turned down the opportunity to carry the Russian flag at the Opening Ceremony because he thought it would be bad for him to leave altitude.
In May 2016 WADA (World Anti-Doping Agency) commissioned a report, the McLaren Report, to look into allegations of systematic Russian doping and a cover-up to avoid positives at the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics. The report was released in two parts, in July and December 2016, and confirmed the allegations. In 2017 the IOC formed a commission to investigate this, headed by IOC Member Denis Oswald, and usually referred to as the Oswald Commission. In late October 2017 the Oswald Commission began to release its findings.
One of the first findings was to implicate Aleksandr Legkov, the gold medalist in this event. Legkov was disqualified and his medal effectively removed. He immediately appealed to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS). Eight days later, the silver medalist, Maksim Vylegzhanin, was also disqualified. About 10 days before the PyeongChang Winter Olympics began, the CAS reached a decision and Legkov and Vylegzhanin were exonerated and their medals were restored.
In the case of Legkov, the IOC actually appealed the decision of the CAS to the Swiss Federal Tribunal, which upheld the decision of the CAS, which meant that Legkov was exonerated and his gold medal status restored.

The World Champion of 1967, Viktor Mamatov, was considered the strongest Soviet contender for the gold medal. To the surprise of many Norwegian journalists, a 31-year-old newcomer on the international circuit, Magnar Solberg was given the last place on the Norwegian team, and former World Champion Olav Jordet became only a substitute.
The youngest member on the Soviet team, 21-year-old Aleksandr Tikhonov, was the first to start out of 60 competitors from 16 countries. The silver medalist of the 1967 World Championships, the 33-year-old Pole Stanisław Szczepaniak, was wearing start number two, and Magnar Solberg followed with start number three. Those three early starters should more or less dominate the event.
After the first round of shooting the Soviet Union’s Vladimir Gundartsev had a scant lead, only two seconds ahead of Solberg, with Nikolay Puzanov 42 seconds behind in third place, all of them with 5 hits. On the second shooting round both Solberg and Gundartsev continued with perfect shooting scores, but Solberg had built a one minute lead. Szczepaniak had advanced from seventh to third place, another minute behind. The third shooting session turned out to be decisive. Solberg once again was perfect, while both Gundartsev and Szczepaniak sustained one-minute penalties. Tikhonov, with two penalty minutes on his two first shooting rounds, was now in second place, over one and a half minutes behind, with Gundartsev another minute behind in third place. The last round of shooting brought no change among the medal candidates. Solberg made his fourth perfect shooting round, and would finish the race as a surprising gold medal winner, 55 second ahead of Tikhonov, the fastest skier of the day. Gundartsev secured the bronze medal half a minute ahead of Szczepaniak, but was 4:42 behind the gold medalist.
Magnar Solberg, a police officer from Trondheim, was an unexpected winner. He had never before done all perfect shooting rounds in a competition, and he had never even won a national championship. His only national championships was won four years later, just before his second Olympic appearance in the 1972 Sapporo Games. The silver medalist Aleksandr Tikhonov was at the start of an impressive international career which included three more Olympic appearances.

Unlike the 100, this race would follow the predicted course and turn into a triumph for the USA’s Jack Medica but only after a tremendous duel. Shumpei Uto took a lead over Medica but the American fought back and narrowed a lead. A spurt by the Japanese swimmer pushed him further ahead but his exertion took much out of him and Medica responded. Medica and Uto battled for gold in the final 50 metres with the American only taking the lead with 10 metres to go.
One competitor who did not qualify from his heat was Brazil’s João Havelange. Havelange became one of the world’s leading sports administrators as both a long serving member of the IOC and as president of FIFA, the governing body of world football.

It was true that they did not arrive at Lake Placid as world champions as their West German rivals had used home advantage to claim the 1979 title and it was also true that Switzerland had already bested them in the two-man event but East Germany were still expected to dominate.
Manfred Nehmer’s GDR I sled put down a marker in their first run and recorded the first sub-one minute time in the track’s history. Reunited with brakeman Bernard Germeshausen
 after the two had competed in separate teams in the two-man event he was the class of the field in the first three runs and his time of 59.73 in run three again broke the track record. Two-man champion Erich Schärer posted the best time of the final run and this proved just enough to edge Switzerland I ahead of the other East German crew.
Further down the field as part of the US I crew that finished in twelfth place was Willie Davenport,  the same Willie Davenport who twelve years earlier in Mexico City had won the 110 m hurdles gold. Jonnie Woodall of Great Britain recorded his best Olympic finish of ninth in this event but his appearance was more notable for the fact that he became the first and, to 2010, only person to compete in both singles and doubles luge and two-man and four-man bobsleigh.

In 1962 he was World Champion as a bantamweight while in 1963 he moved up to featherweight and won the World Championships in this class. Miyake held the world record in the class and with the Japanese fans backing him, was a clear favorite. He would be challenged by American Isaac Berger, the 1956 gold medalist and silver medalist in this class at Rome in 1960. The two tied with 122.5 in the press, but Miyake took a huge lead with 122.5 in the snatch, as Berger snatched only 107.5 kg, missing his second and third attempts at 112.5 kg, and dropping to third, behind Miyake’s teammate Hiroshi Fukuda. Miyake and Berger both set world records in the clean & jerk, lifting 152.5 kg, which gave Miyake the overall gold medal and a total world record of 397.5 kg, while Berger moved back up to a silver medal position. Poland’s Mieczysław Novak took bronze after lifting 150.0 kg in the clean & jerk.
Berger retired after the 1964 Olympics while Miyake continued to dominate the class, winning the 1965-66 World Championships, and repeating as gold medalist at Mexico City in 1968.

Though the European press did not realize it, the two weeks of the Atlanta Olympics were about as cool as that region of the nation ever gets in late July and August. To avoid the heat, the race started at 7:05 AM, but by the time the race ended, the temperature had risen to almost 80° F. (26° C.), with humidity approaching 80%. The Olympic course was designed to basically follow the outline of the course used for the annual Atlanta Marathon, but changed slightly to allow for a start and finish in the Olympic Stadium on the out-and-back course.
There was again no dominant male marathoner entering the 1996 Olympics and the race was considered wide-open. The concern over the heat, and the lack of any favorites, led the pack to run almost together for the bulk of the race and resulted in the closest finish of any Olympic marathon. The three medalists finished within eight seconds of one another, and contested the final outcome on the Olympic track. The race was won by the unheralded Josia Thugwane of South Africa, who held off Korea’s Lee Bong-Ju, who finished second, only three seconds back, and Kenya’s Erick Wainaina, who won the bronze medal. Thugwane was an experienced marathoner, as the Atlanta race was the 19th of his career. He had won several races in South Africa, but his only marathon victory outside his native country had come in Honolulu in December 1995. He would later win at Fukuoka in 1997. In his native country, because of his new-found riches, he was a marked man. He had been robbed and shot at only a few months before his Olympic victory, and was required to live under bodyguard protection for him and his family.

Norway had won the 2005 World Championship, and was second to Germany in 2004, with Russia second in 2005. France, third at the 2004 Worlds, was also expected to be strong. But an unusual thing happened on the opening leg as the lead was taken by a nation with no significant biathlon history, the United States, with Jay Hakkinen putting them almost four seconds up on the Czech Republic, with Germany in third. But that didn’t last long as the USA dropped to eighth after the second leg, with Germany moving into the lead over Italy and Poland. By the final exchange the Germans led, with Russia second and France third, while Norway was struggling, back in 10th place, as Frode Andresen missed seven shots and had to ski two penalty loops. Germany would hold on for the gold medal, Russia finishing second. The race for the bronze was extremely close with Sweden’s Carl Johan Bergman and France’s Raphaël Poirée coming to the line almost together. But a stumble right at the line by Bergman enabled France to get onto the podium, winning by about a boot-length. Norway would move up in the final leg, as Ole Einar Bjørndalen brought them up to fifth. The United States? They would finish ninth.

He won seven matches – one by fall, one by default, and five by decision – to take the gold medal. The runner-up was his teammate Arthur Lindfors, who repeated his silver medal finish from Antwerp. The bronze was won by Estonian Roman Steinberg, who was completely unheralded and was never heard from again internationally. Edvard Westerlund would compete thru the 1936 Olympics, winning a bronze medal in lightweight in 1928, but was not ranked at Berlin.
