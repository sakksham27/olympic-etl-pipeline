1017,"500 metres, Women",1964 Winter Olympics,37,Speed Skating,/editions/37/sports/SSK,30 January 1964 — 12:25,"Eisschnellaufbahn im Olympiaeisstadion, Innsbruck",28 from 13 countries,na,na,"This was the first women’s event in 1964, as it always was in this era, and the only one for which there seemed to be any suspense as to the winner. In the longer distance events, the gold medals were conceded to Lidiya Skoblikova, the 1963 World Champion. She had won gold medals at the 1960 Winter Olympics in the 1,500 and 3,000, and at the 1963 Worlds, had won all four distances. But the short nature of the 500 left it more open to upsets than the longer races. The world record holder was another Soviet, Inga Voronina, but she had failed to make the Soviet team due to a stomach ailment.
After the pair had false started. Irina Yegorova of the Soviet Union started in the first pair and posted an Olympic record 45.4. There were 28 starters and 14 pairs, and Yegorova’s mark lasted for a long time, as Skoblikova was not scheduled until the 13th pair. Skoblikova started in 11.5 to Yegorova’s 11.4, but her strength then brought her around in 45.0, the second fastest time ever, winning her the gold medal. The Soviets swept the medals with Tatyana Sidorova finishing in 44.5. This was the first ever medal sweep in Olympic speed skating, although the Norwegian men would match it six days later in the 5,000 m. Yegorova was a top sprinter, who had won a pre-Olympic test on 26 January, defeating Skoblikova in the process. She had been second in the 500 at the 1963 World Championships, and would win it at the 1964 and 1966 Worlds. Skoblikova was on her way, winning her third Olympic gold medal, and would sweep all four distances in Innsbruck. A few weeks later she would win the 1964 World Championships, and would win all four distances there as well, tying Yegorova for first in the 500.

That role settled on Japan’s Kyoko Hamaguchi, who had won the 2002-03 World Championships. Her main contenders were expected to be China’s Wang Xu, runner-up at the 2002 Worlds, American Toccara Montgomery, runner-up at the 2003 Worlds, and Canadian Christine Nordhagen, World Champion in 2000 and three times a World Champion as a middleweight. Only Wang and Hamaguchi got through the pools to the knockout phase, where they were drawn against each other in the semi-final, with Wang winning, 6-4, in a controversial decision where the Japanese coaches thought two points awarded to Wang should have gone to Hamaguchi. Wang’s finals opponent was Russian Gyuzel Manyurova, who had recently won the 2004 European title, but she was no match for Wang, who won the gold medal, 7-2. Hamaguchi did come back to win the bronze medal, which she would repeat at Beijing in 2008. At only 18-years-old, Wang’s victory made her the youngest ever Olympic wrestling champion.

She was competing in her fourth Olympics, but her only medal had been a bronze in 1996. The 1999 World Champion had been Czech athlete Ludmila Formanová but she withdrew in round one with an injured ankle. The final pace was set by Czech Helena Fuchsová who led thru 400 metres in a rapid 55.04. Britain’s Kelly Holmes went into the lead at 600 metres, trailed by Mutola and Austria’s Steffi Graf. Mutola moved into the lead off the final turn and pulled away to win by four metres, with Graf getting silver and Holmes the bronze. Mutola had ended her big-meet jinx and would win the 2001 and 2003 World Championships. This was the first ever gold medal won for Mozambique.

Other contenders included Germany’s Katrin Rutschow-Stomporowski, runner-up at the last two World Championships and 1996 Olympic champion in the quadruple sculls, Rumyana Neykova, the 1999 World third-place finisher, and Sweden’s Maria Brandin, the 1995 World Champion and 1997 and 1998 bronze medalist. Brandin was also the winner of the Princess Royal Challenge Cup at the Henley Royal Regatta every year from 1993 through 1998 except 1994. Russia had won the 1998 World Championships, but sent a different rower, Yuliya Aleksandrova, to Sydney.
Rutschow-Stomporowski had the fastest time in the opening round, in a heat that included Aleksandrova, while Karsten, Neykova, and New Zealand’s Sonia Waddell won the other heats. Brandin, meanwhile, was eliminated in Neykova’s semi-final, which included Waddell and Australian Gina Douglas, while Germany, Belarus, and Russia all advanced in the other heat. In the medal round, the final section of the course played host to an extremely exciting conclusion, with the three front runners finishing within a second of each other and over seven seconds ahead of the rest of the field. Neykova and Karsten seemed dead even as they crossed the finish line, but a photo finish demonstrated that the latter had defended her gold medal by the slimmest of margins: 0.01 seconds. Rutschow-Stomporowski arrived very shortly thereafter, but still only in time for bronze.

Brazil qualified automatically as hosts, and were joined by the top two teams in the 2015 FIVB World Cup in Japan, China and Serbia. Also qualified were the winners of five Continental Olympic Qualification Tournaments in Africa (Cameroon), Asia (Japan), Europe (Russia), NORCECA - North, Central America & Caribbean - (USA) and South America (Argentina). The compliment of 12 teams was made up with four teams (Italy, Netherlands, South Korea and Puerto Rico) coming through two Olympic Qualification Tournaments held in Japan and San Juan, Puerto Rico.
Of the top eight seeds, only Italy failed to qualify for the quarter-finals and with it ended Eleonora Lo Bianco’s hope of a first Olympic medal in her fifth attempt. The defending champions and top seeds Brazil won pool A in spectacular fashion, winning all five matches, and without dropping a set. They came into the tournament as the winners of the FIVB World Grand Prix shortly before the Olympics. The 2013 and 2015 European Champions Russia, and the two Asian entrants, South Korea and Japan, joined Brazil in the quarter-finals out of pool A. Only three matches in this pool went beyond three sets and only one, between the bottom two teams, Cameroon and Argentina went to five sets.
In pool B, the reigning World champions, the United States, were nearly as impressive as Brazil, winning all five matches, but they lost five sets in the process and had to come from a set down in their final match against the 2015 World Cup winners China to win 3-1. China lost three of their five pool matches but just squeezed through to the quarters in fourth place behind both the Netherlands and Serbia, who had finished second to China in the World Cup. The Netherlands engaged in three five-setters in this pool. Firstly they came from 2-1 down against China to win 15-13 in the tie-break set, and then they threw away a 2-1 lead against the USA to lose 2-3 and with a place in the last eight assured they threw away a 2-0 lead to Serbia only to clinch victory 15-8 in the fifth set.
The Netherlands, USA and Serbia all eased into the semi-finals with little difficulty against, respectively, South Korea, Japan and Russia, but the final quarter-final clash between China and Brazil was an epic contest between the 2nd and 3rd teams on the FIVB ranking list. Brazil took the first set 25-15 before China won the next two 25-23, 25-22 before Brazil levelled it at two-sets all before China made it through to the last four with a 15-13 win in the fifth set in the longest women’s match of the tournament, lasting 2hr 14m.
It was far easier for China in the semi-final as they disposed of the Netherlands 3-1, and in a match that swung both ways, Serbia eventually overcame the USA 15-13 in the fifth set in the other semi. The Americans had the consolation of beating the Netherlands 3-1 in the third-place match and thus emulate their men by taking bronze.
The final was between world ranked number two, China and the sixth ranked Serbia, and it was the Europeans who opened up a lead by taking the first set 25-19 before China then took control and proved to be too strong for their opponents, winning the next three sets 25-17, 25-22, 25-23 to secure a 3-1 victory and their third Olympic gold medal and first since 2004. A member of their first gold-medal winning team at Los Angeles in 1984 was Lang Ping, coach of the 2016 team. For the Serbian women, they had the honour of winning their country’s first ever Olympic volleyball medal. China’s Zhu Ting won the MVP, just as she had done in the 2015 World Cup.

There Steve Williams won his only major championship ever. In 1978 Scotland’s Allan Wells won the Commonwealth Games silver medal in the century, trailing the evergreen Don Quarrie of Jamaica. Cuba presented its best sprinter since Enrique Figuerola in the person of Silvio Leonard, who won the Pan-American Games gold medal in 1975 and 1979. The best American sprinters of 1980 were probably James Sanford, who ran a series of outstanding times but was often injured, and Stanley Floyd, who won the rare American triple of the NCAA/TAC/Olympic Trials. Unfortunately, neither Floyd nor Sanford could compete in Moskva because of the American-led boycott. With American sprinting strength down the 100 metres was severely devalued, as were several sprint races. In the Olympic final, Wells and Leonard both ran 10.25 but the gold medal went to Wells in a reading of the photo.

But because of the Soviet-led boycott, García could not compete, leaving the field seemingly open for Kim. In the quarter-finals he faced American Jerry Page and lost by a 4-1 decision. This enraged the Korean boxing officials, who threatened to withdraw from the tournament, but later said they were doing it only to call attention to what was considered a pro-American bias among the judges. Page went on to win the gold medal, with unanimous decisions in the semi-finals and over Thailand’s Dhawee Umponmaha in the final. Like all of the United States’s 1984 boxing gold medalists, Page turned professional, but had a desultory career, finishing in 1990 with 11 wins and 4 losses. Umponmaha never fought professionally as a boxer, but he did do so in Muay Thai kickboxing, using the name Khaopong Sitthichuchai.

He placed third at the 1974 Europeans, behind Britain’s Brendan Foster. Virén was known, however, as a master at peaking. Some thought he was too much of a master at that, and rumors abounded that he one of the first to use blood doping to increase his endurance for the Olympics. This was never proven. In Montréal he had already defended his 10K gold medal. In the 5K final, Foster led for the first 2,000 metres when Virén went to the front. A pack of seven runners was together at the bell, with New Zealanders Rod Dixon and Dick Quax known for their finishing speed. But Virén held them off, winning the gold over Quax in second. Virén became the only man to win the 5K/10K double twice at the Olympics. Dick Quax had only recently recovered from a dose of the flu, during which he had lost 10 lbs in weight.
Both bronze medal winner Klaus-Peter Hildenbrand and 6th place finisher Willy Polleunis had difficult passages to the final. Both men were initially disqualified for impeding home favourite Grant McLaren in their heat but were reinstated after appeal. Foster broke the Olympic record in a very fast heat which saw Lasse Orimus and Marc  Smet run within the previous record but fail to qualify for the final

Tallent had been silver medallist in Beijing and originally won silver in London, but was moved up to the gold medal after a doping disqualification. France’s Yohann Diniz, the world record holder, took the lead and held it through 30 km. He soon succumbed to intestinal distress. The lead was then taken by Canadian Evan Dunfee, but Tallent took over and led through 40 and 45 km. He could not hold the pace, as Tóth caught him at 48 km and eventually won by 18 seconds. Japan’s Hirooki Arai was eight seconds behind Tallent, and finished 14 seconds ahead of Dunfee. Arai was soon disqualified, however, and Dunfee moved up to third place. Arai’s DQ was for impeding Dunfee and interfering with him, but on Japanese appeal the disqualification was overturned and Arai received the bronze medal with Dunfee fourth.

From 1988-2000 he was the favorite but won only in 1988. In 1992, he did not make a height in the final. In 1996 he withdrew from the qualifying with an Achilles’ injury.

She was sick of all the media attention and pressure, and wanted to go home to her two children. Only after a long talk with her coach and husband, 1928 Olympian Jan Blankers, she decided to start the semi-finals. Her eyes still red from the tears, she dominated her race. On a wet and muddy track, she paced to a third gold medal the next day.
Third placed Mickey Patterson is noted as the first Afro-American woman to win an Olympic medal; high jumper Alice Coachman won the first gold medal the next day. However, it was later revealed that Patterson actually had finished in fourth place, as the finish photo clearly showed Shirley Strickland crossing the line earlier.

Czech Republic’s Sáblíková had won the 2010 Olympic title and was World Champion in 2007, 2012 and 2015-16. In addition, Sáblíková had won the combined 3,000 m/5,000 m World Cup 11 seasons in a row, since 2006/2007. Despite these impressive records, neither woman was in great shape in the run-up to the Olympics. Both had suffered from injuries early in the skating season, and neither had recorded a win in the World Cup circuit. Others were eager to step in the void left by these dominant skaters, with World Cup wins recorded by Antoinette de Jong, Miho Takagi, Nataliya Voronina and Ivanie Blondin.
None of these would claim the gold, however, as it was quite unexpectedly won by Carlijn Achtereekte. She had surprisingly secured a spot in one of the major commercial teams, and had earned the third Olympic spot at the Dutch trials, behind De Jong and Wüst. In Pyeongchang, she skated early in the field, recording 3:59.21, a fraction slower than the track record that had been set by Wüst at the 2017 World Championships. Wüst was the first of the favorites to race, and she seemed to comfortably go below Achtereekte’s mark, having a 1.5 second lead with just 2 laps to go. But Wüst’s pace slowed in the final 400 m, and she crossed the line a fraction slower: 3:59.28. The 11th pair saw Takagi and De Jong competing, but neither seriously approached Achtereekte’s splits. De Jong came closest with 4:00.02, leaving three Dutch women in medal positions with one pair left. In that final pair, Sáblíková recorded consistent lap times, but without her usual speed. A good final lap did bring her close to the podium, but she couldn’t do better than 4:00.54. The Dutch sweep of the medals was the third time a single country won all medals in the 3,000 m. This had happened before in 1984 (East Germany) and 1998 (Germany).

14083,"Singles, Women",1994 Winter Olympics,45,Figure Skating,/editions/45/sports/FSK,23 – 25 February 1994,"OL-Amfi, Hamar",27 from 16 countries,"Skaters were ranked on Ordinal Placement, based on judges' points, with final placement for each section determined by Majority Placements.  The tiebreaker for the Short Program was the Required Elements score, while the tiebreaker for the Free Skating was the Technical Merit score.  Thus, if a skater was ranked first by a majority of the judges, that skater was placed first overall for that section.  Ties were broken by a Subsequent Majority rule, i.e., if the skaters were ranked for the same position by the same number of judges, Majority Placement for the next higher position for each skater determined who was ranked higher.  Final placement was determined by factored placements.  The tiebreakers were then 1) Number of Majority Placements, 2) Total Ordinals of Majority, 3) Total Ordinals.  The placement for the  the Short Program was factored by 0.5 (33.3%), and the placement for Free Skating was factored by 1.0 (66.7%).  The sums of the factored placements were then used to determine final placement, with the Free Skating being the tiebreaker.",na,"Figure skating had always seen its share of controversy, with the judges’ scores often highly criticized and political maneuvers between national federations known to occur frequently. Often, skaters were placed not by how they skated but by their previous reputation, known as protocol judging. But the events surrounding the 1994 ladies’ event raised figure skating to a new low, or high, in the world of controversy.
The 1993 World Champion was Ukraine’s Oksana Bayul, but the 1991-94 European Champion had been France’s Surya Bonaly, a very athletic Black skater, who was often penalized by the judges for her lack of artistic impression. Among the American women, Nancy Kerrigan and Tonya Harding had been 1-2 since the retirement of Kristi Yamaguchi after the 1992 Winter Olympics. But Kerrigan usually won, her artistry overcoming the athletic jumping ability of Harding, who was only the second woman ever to land a triple axel (after Midori Ito (JPN)). Harding also did not fit into the world of figure skating. She did not come from a wealthy family, and was definitely from the other side of the tracks. When she did not perform well, her mother yelled at her in front of the other families, loudly calling her a scum and a bitch. Tonya hunted and fished, was an accomplished auto mechanic, played pool, smoked cigarettes, and was completely outside the skating establishment.
Kerrigan was not wealthy either, but came from a background somewhat similar to Carol Heiss. Her family worked several jobs to allow her to compete in the expensive world of figure skating, and they re-mortgaged their home to help pay the travel and coaching expenses. Her small hometown of Stoneham, Massachusetts helped support her and the family by often chipping in for travel expenses. Beautiful, quiet, and classy, Kerrigan started to reap the rewards of the more traditional skating world, and received several commercial endorsements. This enabled her to become quite comfortable financially and erase her family’s economic concerns. Harding was getting none of this. Without Kerrigan’s looks and with Tonya’s background and baggage, no endorsements came her way.
Harding saw one way out. To get endorsements and money, she had to win the gold medal in Lillehammer and to her that meant eliminating Kerrigan as a competitor. Harding was then married to Jeff Gillooly. Gillooly contacted a friend, Shawn Eckardt, asking how a hit could be arranged on Kerrigan, disabling her for the Olympics. Eckardt eventually contacted Derrick Smith, who hired his nephew, Shane Stant, who agreed to attack Kerrigan and injure her leg. Gillooly did not know that Eckardt, Smith, and Stant tape recorded the conversation where the plan was hatched. The hit was supposed to take place on Cape Cod, Massachusetts, where Kerrigan trained, but Stant was such an idiot that he could not find the ice rink, although it was known to virtually everybody. The group finally settled on attacking Kerrigan at the US Nationals in Detroit. Shortly before the competition, Kerrigan came off the ice after a training session, when a large man assaulted her with a solid-metal baton, hitting her just above the knee. The assailant was Stant, who escaped by running out of the arena to a getaway car. Kerrigan collapsed, crying out, “Why? Why me?” She could not skate at the Nationals.
Two days later, Tonya Harding won the US Nationals and qualified for the Olympic team. The US had only two spots for the ladies’ event in Lillehammer. The second spot could go to Michelle Kwan, who finished second to Harding. But the US figure skating authorities held the spot open for Kerrigan, if she could show that she could recover in time for the Winter Olympics. Kwan graciously stepped aside and Kerrigan did recover in time to be named to the Winter Olympic team.
Then the hunt started for the perpetrators of the crime. By late December, police had found Shawn Eckardt and the tape recording surfaced. Shane Stant turned himself in just before January 1994. In mid-January Harding was grilled by the FBI for 10½ hours and the next day, Gillooly was arrested. When it was obvious that Harding knew of the plot, and had in fact approved of it, the USOC planned to toss her off the Olympic team. But Harding lawyered up, threatened a huge lawsuit if that was done, and the USOC capitulated.
So in Lillehammer the competition was surrounded by a media frenzy probably not seen before at any Olympic Games. In the United States the publicity around the event led to the highest television ratings in years for any American program. The short program began on 23 February. Almost lost amidst all the furor was the return of Katarina Witt, the 1984-88 gold medalist, now eligible again as professionals were allowed in Olympic figure skating. Witt was the first big name to skate in the short program, and she performed well, after being out of international competition for six years, eventually placing sixth in the short.
Harding came out next among the favorites and US sportswriter Tony Kornheiser of the Washington Post described her appearance, “She had on so much makeup, it looked like she rear-ended a Mary Kay Cadillac. I half expected her to skate over and take my drink order.” Harding’s medal chances were over almost immediately, as she made numerous errors in the short program, and placed only 10th.
The competition would now come down to the three favorites – Kerrigan, Bayul, and Bonaly. They placed 1-2-3 in the short program, in that order, and if any of them could win the free skate, they would win the gold medal. The next day, the soap opera went on in training when Bayul collided with Tanja Szewczenko (GER), while they shared the ice. Bayul’s leg was cut and she needed stitches, but would be able to compete the next night.
In the free skate Harding was an early starter because of her placement in the short program. She barely made it onto the ice in time to avoid disqualification, skated about 45 seconds rather slovenly, then skated over to the judges, starting crying and asked to start again – her bootlace was torn. She was allowed to re-start, would place seventh in the free skate, and eighth overall. This episode was later re-enacted in a famous Seinfeld episode.
Kerrigan skated next, first up among the leaders and produced a nearly flawless performance. The gold medal seemed to be hers. But then Bayul skated a similar performance, and the judges ranked her first, five votes to four, although things could change depending on Bonaly’s performance. Bonaly was the last skater but slipped to fourth place, the bronze medal going to China’s Lu Chen. After Bonaly skated the results were final, and Bayul had the gold medal over Kerrigan by the narrowest of margins. Had any of four judges given Kerrigan 1/10th more, or Bayul 1/10th less, for any score, the gold medal would have gone to Kerrigan.
Bringing some sanity to the proceedings was the final skater, Katarina Witt. Witt had won her first gold medal in Sarajevo, which was now a shattered city, destroyed by the Serbian ethnic cleansing. Witt skated to Where Have All the Flowers Gone? in memory of her adopted city. She placed seventh overall, a lovely reminder of a better time in figure skating.
After the Winter Olympics, Harding pled guilty, copping a plea to conspiring to hinder prosecution of a case. She had to perform 500 hours of community service, and paid a $100,000 fine. She and Jeff Gillooly eventually divorced. She was banned for life by the US Figure Skating Association, and her 1994 US title stripped. Needing to support herself, she later became a professional boxer.
Bayul turned professional and did very well for herself in ice shows, moving to the United States. With her new-found riches came some difficulties with alcohol, including an episode in January 1997 when she was charged with drunken driving in Connecticut, while traveling over 100 miles/hour (160 km/hour). She later claimed that she did not mean to go that fast but had lost control because she was so entranced by a Madonna song she was listening to.
Kerrigan married her agent, Jerry Solomon. She had some controversy after Lillehammer, appearing at Disney World with Mickey Mouse, where she was heard to say, “This is most corny thing I’ve ever done.” She later hosted Saturday Night Live, where she jokingly referred to that incident, saying what she actually said was, “This is most horny thing I’ve ever done.” She skated in a few ice shows, but mainly raised her family in Massachusetts.
It is said that reality is stranger than fiction. This story could not have been made up.

Lotte Mühe broke Baron’s record just three weeks before the Games whilst the reigning European champion, Hilde Schrader, was also in good form. Schrader broke the Olympic record in heat, equalled the world record in the semi-final and comfortably took the gold medal ahead of Baron and Muhe. Although Schrader’s time in the final was her slowest of the Games there was a mitigating factor, the champion suffered a “wardrobe malfunction” when one of the straps of her swimsuit broke. “I would have gone faster”, she said, “if I had not been so embarrassed”. The standard of this event had improved had improved greatly in the four years since Paris, 1924 silver medallist Agnes Geraghty swam 16 seconds faster but did not make the final.

During group play, which served to eliminate just two teams (Greece and Angola), the Ukrainians appeared as the strongest team, winning all their Group A matches. In the other group, Denmark and South Korea, together responsible for winning all Olympic gold medals between 1988 and 2000, tied for first place after a 29-29 tie. After four fairly close quarter-finals, the nations remaining were defending champions Denmark, Ukraine, World Champions France, and South Korea.

The South Koreans started strongly against France, but saw the World Champions stage a comeback in the second half. The French scored 31-32 in the penultimate minute, but failed to score in the remaining time.
The final was thus a replay of the 1996 Olympic final, which the Danish women had won. South Korea, the 1988 and 1992 champion, was eager to regain the gold medal, and this made for an excellent handball match. After a 14-14 first half, the game fluctuated.

Katrine Fruelund scored two goals to tie the match in the very last minute, scoring a 7-m throw to make it 33-33. Kim Cha-Yeon then seemed to make the winning goal (34-33) with less than half a minute on the clock, but within 20 seconds, Fruelund once more tied the game at 34-all.

The Olympic record was Harry Hillman’s 49.2, set in winning the gold medal at St. Louis in 1904.  Hillman was in London in 1908 but only ran the 400 hurdles.  The top British one-lapper was Wyndham Halswelle, who had been AAA champion in 1905-06 and 1908, and earlier in July, had run 48.4 in Glasgow to break Bredin’s world best time for 440 yards.
After setting an Olympic record of 48.4 in the second round, Halswelle was easily the fastest of the qualifiers.  In the final he faced three Americans, John Carpenter, John Taylor, and William Robbins and the race resulted in possibly the most controversial finish in Olympic track & field history.
Carpenter was drawn on the inside with Halswelle, Robbins, and Taylor outside him in that order, and after Robbins had been involved in some over-rigorous jockeying for position, Carpenter entered the home straight with Halswelle at his shoulder.  At this point, Carpenter, in order to prevent Halswelle from passing him, moved progressively farther towards the outside of the track, forcing Halswelle to within 18 inches of the outside curb.  By this time the British officials had seen enough and Dr. Arthur Roscoe Badger, the judge on the final bend, ran up the track signalling the judges to break the tape.  Carpenter crossed the line in an unofficial 48.4, while Halswelle slowed to a jog.
After a lengthy inquiry on the evening of the race, Carpenter was disqualified and the race was ordered to be re-run two days later, in lanes (then termed strings, as strings separated each lane), but without Carpenter.  The precise statement was, “The judges have decided that the race is void, and order same to be re-run in strings on Saturday next [25 July], at 12 o’clock.  J. C. Carpenter is disqualified.”  American officials ordered Robbins and Taylor not to take part in the re-run and Halswelle ran alone to take the Olympic title.
Even before the U.S. team left for home they announced that, as Carpenter had crossed the line first, they would consider him to be the Olympic champion.  There is no recorded response to a reader’s letter in a British newspaper inquiring if, by the same reasoning, the Americans would consider Pietri to be the Olympic marathon champion?  Unfortunately, the ill-feeling lingered and at the 1909 AAU Convention a motion was passed refusing to recognize Carpenter’s disqualification.
Photographs exist of the race and one, published on 24 July 1908 in The Daily Mirror, is quite telling, showing the footprints of the runners as they entered the home straight.  From this photograph and the footprints, there is little doubt that Carpenter ran extremely wide coming off the turn.  Another photograph of the finish confirms that he forced Halswelle to the very outside of the track.  Amos Alonzo Stagg, a member of the American Olympic Committee, and later a famous football coach, attempted to assuage both sides when he noted that Carpenter “certainly took the route complained of but that he didn’t commit a deliberate foul as it would have been considered an acceptable tactic at a track meet in America.”
But the rules in force at the 1908 Olympics were British, those of the Amateur Athletic Association.  Their rule regarding obstruction during a race was quite explicit.
“Any competitor wilfully jostling, or running across, or obstructing another competitor, so as to impede his progress, shall forfeit his right to be in the competition, and shall not be awarded any position or prize that he would otherwise have been entitled to.”
The 400 metre controversy received huge play in both the American and British press, with feelings running along nationalistic lines.  The pamphlet published by the British, A Reply to Certain Criticisms, also devoted an entire chapter to the race.  In it they quoted a letter from David Scott Duncan which was published in The Field on 29 August 1908, which also disputes Stagg’s statement that Carpenter’s tactics would have been allowed in the United States.  Duncan had been the referee of the 400 metres.
“That Halswelle was badly bored and obstructed is, of course, beyond question, and the American rules as to such tactics are even more explicit than those obtaining in Britain.  Here they are:-
Rule III.-The Referee.-When in a final heat a claim of foul or interference is made, he (the referee) shall have power to disqualify the competitor who was at fault if he considers the foul intentional or due to culpable carelessness, and he shall also have the power to order a new race between such competitors as he thinks entitled to such a privilege.
Rule XVIII.-The Course.-Each competitor shall keep in his respective position from start to finish in all races on straightaway tracks, and in all races on track with one or more turns he shall not cross to the inner edge of the track except when he is at least six feet in advance of his nearest competitor.  After turning the last corner into the straight in any race each competitor must keep a straight course to the finish line, and not cross, either to the outside or the inside, in front of any of his opponents.
In the face of the above rules of Union of which Mr. Sullivan is president, he is surely left “without a leg to stand upon.”  I may add that I was referee of the Four Hundred Metres.
DAVID SCOTT DUNCAN
Wyndham Halswelle did address the situation in a letter he sent to The Sporting Life.
“As regards the Four Hundred Metres Race, Carpenter did not strike me any vigorous blows with his elbow, nor were there any marks on my chest, nor did I say that Carpenter struck me or show the marks to any Press representative.  I did not attempt to pass the Americans until the last corner, reserving my effort for the finishing straight.  Here I attempted to pass Carpenter on the outside, since he was not far enough from the curb to do so on the inside, and I was too close up to have crossed behind him.  Carpenter’s elbow undoubtedly touched my chest, for as I moved outwards to pass him he did likewise, keeping his right in front of me.
“In this manner he bored me across quite two-thirds of the track, and entirely stopped my running.  As I was well up to his shoulder, and endeavouring to pass him, it is absurd to say that I could have come up on the inside.  I was too close after half way round the bend to have done this; indeed, to have done so would have necessitated chopping my stride, and thereby losing anything from two to four yards.
“When about thirty to forty yards from the tape I saw the officials holding up their hands, so slowed up, not attempting to finish all out.”
John Carpenter also gave his version of events, which was published in The Daily Mail on 24 July 1908:
“I started with the inside berth.  Halswelle was next to me; Robbins next [to him] and Taylor on the outside.  Up the final straight away Robbins led, and I was running second.  Halswelle was close behind me, I imagine.
“At the first curve the positions were unchanged.  Then, at the second bend right at the top of the course I, because of my long stride, was unable to stick to the inside berth.  It was at this point that I attempted to pass Robbins, and [moved] wide into the straight,  Halswelle was still behind me.
“From this point my path was absolutely straight to the finish line.  For about [10] or 15 yards - at eighty yards from the finish - Halswelle was running absolutely abreast of me, with plenty of room on the outside of him, and he could have passed on the inside of me if necessary.
“I do not know of any contact between us at any point during the race.  I always know exactly what I do during a race, and I am perfectly certain we did not touch.  I do not see how a race could have been more fairly run.”
Wyndham Halswelle had a short, but meteoric track career.  It began in 1904 when he won the Army 880 yards championship.  After winning medals at the 1906 Olympics in Athens in both the 400 metres (silver) and 800 metres (bronze), he won the 100 yards, 220 yards, 440 yards, and 880 yards at the 1906 Scottish AAA Championships - all in the same afternoon.  The actions and attitudes of the Americans at the 1908 Olympics so soured Halswelle’s outlook that he ran just one more race before retiring from the sport in late 1908.  A career Army officer, he tragically died from a sniper’s bullet in France while fighting World War I.
John Carpenter’s track career was also short and there is no record that he ever competed again after the 1908 Olympics.  He attended Cornell and won one IC4A title in 1906, that at 880 yards.  Over 440 yards he was 4th as a freshman in 1905 and 3rd in 1908 at the IC4A’s.  As the 1908 IC4A was considered one of the American Olympic Trial Meets, he was named to the 1908 Olympic team.  Carpenter never competed at the AAU Championship.

Nina Baldycheva had this time the unlucky fate to start as number 1, but her intermediate time at 5 km was first beaten by Raisa Smetanina by 18 seconds. Smetanina’s arch rival from the 5 km, Helena Takalo, this time starting 1.30  behind her Soviet opponent, could not better Smetanina at the halfway point, passing that mark 10 seconds behind her. Defending champion Galina Kulakova starting last of the favorites, was third at 5 km, five seconds behind Takalo. But Takalo, the 5 km champion, then started her move. She gained seconds on Smetanina over the last part of the race, eagerly supported by Finnish coaches, but reached the finish just one second behind Smetanina, and had to be content with the silver medal. Kulakova finished her race 25 seconds behind Smetanina, but beat her teammate Baldycheva’s time by 14 seconds, adding a bronze to her collection of Olympic medals.
Takalo won the 5 km race by 1.04 seconds, and Smetanina the 10 km by 0.87 seconds, certainly deserving of a gold medal each. Takalo finished her great Olympic season by winning both the 5 and 10 km race at Holmenkollen, but the Soviet skiers were not present.

Pilots Christophe Langen and Wolfgang Hoppe of Germany had been joined on the podium at the1 993 World Championship by 1992 Olympic champion Gustav Weder of Switzerland but the Hoppe would compete at Lillehammer only in the four-man event and Langen would not make the team at a ll. This left Weder as one of the favourites alongside Italian, German, Canadian and American crews.
As the event progressed it became apparent that the gold medal would be decided between the Swiss crews piloted by Weder and Reto Götschi. Gotschi held a small advantage of just 0.03 of a second over Weder when he left the start hut at the beginning of the fourth run and held his advantage for most of the course. At the final intermediate timing some 200 m from the finish the splits showed the two crews as equal down to the exact 100th but Götschi dropped a further 0.02 on his way to the finish. It was a bitter sweet ending for the Acklin family as Donat Acklin served as Gustav Weder’s brakeman whilst his brother Guido served the same role for Reto Götschi.  Italy I finished clear of the top German sled for the bronze medal shutting Germany out of the medals for the first time in thirty years.

Behind her other favorites were the Brits Jemma Reekie and Keely Hodgkinson and Cuba’s Rose Mary Almanza.
The only surprise of the heats and semis was that Almanza failed to get out of the third semi-final when she finished fourth. Britain qualified three runners for the final with Alexandra Bell joining Reekie and Hodgkinson, while Mu was joined by her American teammate Raevyn Rogers.
The final saw Mu take the lead as the runners broke for the rail off the first turn, followed by Jamaican Natoya Goule. Mu continued to lead to the bell, running a solid pace, but not blazingly fast, at 57.82 for the first lap. Mu increased the pace on the penultimate turn, opening small gaps among the finalists.
Mu was never passed. On the final turn she stepped it up and opened her margin, having a comfortable lead on the straight as she won gold in 1:55.21, negative splitting her race at 57.82 / 57.39. Behind her, Hodgkinson won silver with a British record of 1:55.88 while Rogers put two Americans on the podium with her bronze medal in a time of 1:56.81.
Mu’s gold medal at age 19-057 made her the second youngest woman to win the Olympic 800, after Kenya’s Pamela Jelimo in 2008 at age 18-256. Mu would add a second gold medal a few days later when she anchored the USA women to gold in the 4 x 400 relay.

Between 1908 and 1926, Ryan or McGrath won 15 of the 19 AAU Championships, with Ryan winning eight and McGrath winning seven.  But McGrath injured his knee in the second round and had to withdraw.  This left Ryan unchallenged and he won easily. Ryan did not approach his own world record of 57.77 (set in 1913), nor did he challenge McGrath’s Olympic record of 54.74. All qualifying marks were carried over to the final round.
Some sources state that Tom Nicolson arrived late and did not compete in the qualifying and a petition by the other contestants allowed him to compete in the finals. Gazet van Antwerpen states that Nicolson qualified for the final by throwing in a special trial later in the afternoon. Thus, it would seem that there were seven athletes advanced to the final, instead of the original six, as the rules stated. Although Nils Linde was then seventh in qualifying, he did compete in the final, per Dalpilen, a Falun (SWE) newspaper. Eventually, only six athletes competed in the final as McGrath withdrew after injuring his knee. His qualifying mark was carried over to the final, which allowed him to place fifth.

Kwan got off to a good start, narrowly winning the short program with Slutskaya second, five first places to four. Young American Sasha Cohen was third after the short, followed by another young American, Sarah Hughes. Cohen was only 18 and Hughes 16, but both were thought to have great potential for the future. In the free skate, Hughes would show how close the future was. She was the first leader to skate in the free program and was solid, but not spectacular, receiving all scores of 5.7 and 5.8. Kwan was next and when she nearly fell early on a triple flip, putting down both hands, she was finished. Her technical scores were mostly 5.6 and 5.7, and better artistic scores could not undo the damage. Slutskaya was the final skater and the title was hers if she could skate cleanly. She almost did, but a few of her landings were less than her best, and her scores were variable, ranging from 5.6 to 5.9. The free skate went to Hughes, five first places to four for Slutskaya. They then tied with 3.0 factored placements, but the free skate was the tiebreaker, giving the gold medal to Hughes, with Kwan winning a bronze medal. Slutskaya was very upset with her artistic scores, as were several of the Russian skaters, and the Russian Federation filed a protest, which was disallowed. Because of injuries in 2006, Michelle Kwan would not make the Olympic team. Her Olympic career ended in 2002, and she is likely the greatest skater never to win Olympic gold.

He was not entirely bereft of competition, however; Japan’s Ikuma Horishima was the reigning World Champion in both moguls and dual moguls, while Anthony Benna of France had taken the moguls title in 2015.
Nonetheless, Kingsbury lived up to his reputation as the favorite in the first qualifying round by finishing well ahead of the rest of the field.

The final was scoreless through regulation time, but An won in extra time with a yuko, giving North Korea its first judo gold medal since 1996. Forciniti won one of the bronze medals, with the other going to Frenchwoman Priscilla Gneto, who defeated the veteran Belgian Ilse Heylen for the bronze.

Another notable entry was Romania’s Veronica Cochelea and Elisabeta Lipă, the latter of whom had won six Olympic rowing medals, including gold in the double sculls in 1984.
In winning their heats, Germany and Romania posted the two fastest times in the opening round and were well ahead of the rest of the pack. In the final, however, Romania struggled and finished in fifth, nearly ten seconds behind the gold medal-winning Germans. In fact, only one nation, the Netherlands, represented by Pieta van Dishoeck and Eeke van Nes, came within five seconds of the Germans and thus captured silver. In addition to both Dutchmen having been the 1998 World runners-up and the 1999 bronze medalists, van Nes also had come in third in the double sculls at the 1996 Summer Olympics.

But nobody had yet ascended via the north face of the mountain, via a huge wall. Two German brothers, who had cycled from München, decided to climb it, but had not publicly announced it. The two brothers, Franz and Toni Schmid, managed to master the rock wall, reaching the top on 1 August 1931. The IOC decided to award this performance with a gold medal during its session at the Los Angeles Olympics in 1932. German IOC member Theodor Lewald accepted the prize in the absence of the two climbers. On 5 September 1932, Lewald handed out the prize in a special ceremony in München. The younger brother, Toni had already died before the Los Angeles Olympics, falling to his death while attempting to climb the Wiesbachhorn in the Austrian Hohe Tauern, so his medal was presented to their father. Toni was an educated construction engineer, Franz became a police inspector in Neuhaus in Schliersee.
At their trip to the Matterhorn in 1931, the Schmids had been accompanied by two friends, who decided at the last minute not to climb with them due to bad weather. Both of them would still find their place in Olympic history, though. Besides remaining a noted mountaineer, Hans Ertl became cameraman (and, allegedly, lover) of controversial and influential director Leni Riefenstahl. Among others, he was the chief cameraman for Olympia, her two-part masterpiece about the 1936 Olympics. Franz had also climbed the north face of the Ortler together with Hans Ertl on 22 June 1931. At the 1936 Games, the fourth friend was also involved: Ernst Krebs won a gold medal in the 10,000 m K1 (kayak). In 1998, German journalist Imke Habegger described the ascent of the north wall in their article on 31 December in the “General-Anzeiger” of Bonn: Sleepless on the Icy Rock Needle.

In November 2013, she had won the first World Cup of the season. The 2006 champion Ireen Wüst (Netherlands) had won the 2011 and 2013 world titles, and had claimed a win in this distance at the European Championships in January, beating Martina Sáblíková, the defending Olympic champion and 2012 World Champion, who had won two World Cups earlier in the season.
The first skater to approach the track record of 4:02.43 (set by Wüst at the 2013 World Championships) was home favorite, Olga Graf. A better 5,000 m skater, she had never placed better than 5th in a 3,000 m World Cup, but now recorded a strong 4:03.47 on home ice. Her race saw just a 0.76 second difference between her best and worst lap. Obviously happy with her performance, Graf enthusiastically unzipped her suit after the race, nearly causing a “wardrobe malfunction” as she wasn’t wearing a bra. Graf’s strong finish turned out to be too good for Pechstein, who lost nearly 3 seconds to Graf in the last two laps. Sáblíková got off to a faster start than Graf, and, as expected, was able to stick with her schedule. She beat Wüst’s track record, the new mark now being 4:01.95. Wüst herself was up next. Typically racing with a faster start but a slower finish, Wüst recorded the fastest opening laps, but she managed to beat Sáblíková’s laps through the 2,200 m mark, after which she only conceded about a second. This was sufficient for Wüst to reclaim her 2006 title, and earn her third Olympic gold medal in all. Graf held on for bronze, while Pechstein’s 4th place meant Germany was not on the podium on this event for the first time since 1972.

In preparation for the Olympics, Curwen herself broke that mark on 10 June 1912, posting 1:20.6 at Birkenhead.
Australia was to be represented by Fanny Durack and Mina Wylie, but not without some effort.  Originally the Australian sports authorities did not wish to “waste” money on sending women to the Olympics.  Finally, the New South Wales Ladies’ Amateur Swimming Association voted to allow the two to go to the Olympics, providing they paid their own way.  A fund was raised which paid Durack’s expenses and Wylie’s family and friends provided her support.  Durack’s sister, Mary, served as their chaperone on the long boat trip.
Mina Wylie had been the better of the two swimmers up to a year before the 1912 Olympics, and she had never lost to Durack to that time.  But Durack changed to the new crawl stroke, from the Trudgeon, and after that, Wylie never defeated Durack.  Prior to the 1912 Olympics, Durack posted world records over 50 yards (27.0), 100 yards (66.0), and 220 yards (2:56.0).  In her first round heat at Stockholm, she broke Curwen’s world record for 100 metres with a time of 1:19.8.
The final came down to Durack, Wylie, and Fletcher.  Daisy Curwen competed in Stockholm and qualified for the final, but had to withdraw when she was rushed to hospital for an emergency appendectomy.  It is unlikely she would have challenged Durack in the final, who won easily in 1:22.2.  A few days later, in an exhibition in the Stockholm Swimming Stadium, Durack broke the world record for 300 metres with a time of 4:43.6.  She eventually set 11 world records between 1906 and 1921.  Although she planned to compete at the 1920 Olympics in Antwerp, that was derailed when, shortly before the Games, she suffered the same fate as Daisy Curwen, and missed the Olympics recovering from an appendectomy.

At the time her doping was revealed Lebedeva was actually a member of the Russian state Duma, the IAAF Women’s Committee, and the World Olympians Association Executive Committee.

It was also the first team shooting event after 97 years, as shooting team events were discontinued after the 1924 Games. While in 1924 team events had at least four members per team, the teams in Tokyo consisted only of two shooters, so it was more of a pairs event. At the World Championships this event was first held in 2018 and had been won by Vitalina Batsarashkina/Artyom Chernousov, while silver went to Wang Qian/Wang Mengyi and bronze to Olena Kostevych/Oleh Omelchuk.

They had scored 586 of 600 at the World Cup in München in May 2019, and both had won individual gold at the 2018 Youth Olympics.
The Indian pair won the first qualification stage followed by Batsarashkina/Chernousov and Jiang/Pang, after which eight teams qualified for the second stage. As Bhaker/Chaudhary only finished seventh in the second qualification stage, they did not reach the medal finals. At this stage the top two teams contested a gold medal match, while the third and fourth placed teams went to the bronze medal match. After six series of the gold medal match Batsarashkina/Chernousov led by 8 to 4, but the next four series were won by Jiang/Pang to give them a 12-8 lead. In the 13th series Jiang/Pang had the first chance to win gold but Batsarashkina/Chernousov won the next two series to equalize at 14-14. Thus, the last series decided the outcome and the Chinese pair won gold. The bronze medal match was decided in the 14th series and gave Ukraine their first shooting medal of the Tokyo Games.

That race had been won by American Robert Finke in a major upset, as he was completely unheralded coming into Tokyo.
The big four led the qualifying, with Romanchuk first in 14:45.99, followed by Finke in 14:47.20, and then Wellbrock in third and Paltrinieri finishing fourth.
Finke was unknown no longer, but in the final he played the same waiting game as he had in the 800, holding third or fourth position for most of the race. Wellbrock led most of the race, taking the lead before 300 metres and holding it into the final lap, with Romanchuk second most of the way. And then Finke exploded on the last lap, as he had done in the 800, splitting the final 50 in 25.78, a full second ahead of Romanchuk, and two seconds faster than Wellbrock, which brought Finke home for a second distance gold medal.
Paltrinieri was never a factor for a medal in the last few laps, as Romanchuk held on for silver and Wellbrock took the bronze. Wellbrock would later win gold in the 10 km open water swim at Tokyo, an event he had also won at the 2019 World Championships.

Horine had set a world record on 29 March 1912, clearing 1.985 (6-6 1/8) at Stanford to break Mike Sweeney’s record of 1.97 (6-5 5/8) which had stood since 1895.  And at the western Olympic Trial, held on 18 May, he set another world record, clearing 6-7, the first person to jump two metres (6-7 = 2.007).  Horine was a pioneer of a new high jumping style, which later became termed the Western Roll, somewhat similar to the straddle roll, the standard jumping style until Dick Fosbury pioneered the Fosbury flop.  The other top Americans were Egon Erickson, who had won the AAU title in 1909 and the eastern Olympic Trial in 1912, and Alma Richards, who had recently won the central Olympic Trial.
The competition initially went about as expected, with Horine, Richards and Erickson lasting until the final five jumpers, joined by Germany’s Hans  Liesche, and Jim Thorpe.  Erickson and Thorpe went out first, failing to clear 1.89 metres.  At 1.91, Liesche cleared on his second attempt, Richards on his last attempt, and Horine failed, leaving him with the bronze medal.  When the bar was raised to 1.93 (6-4), Richards cleared easily on his first attempt. David Wallechinsky, in his The Complete Book of the Olympics, has described the problems that then ensued for Liesche, “Liesche was completely unnerved.  He failed twice.  Then, just as he had composed himself for his final attempt, a gun went off to signal the start of a race.  Liesche waited for the race to end and then composed himself once more.  This time the band began to play.  After nine minutes, a Swedish official approached him and asked him to hurry up.  This was the final blow.  Liesche ran at the bar, but missed completely.” In the final results, other than Liesche, Americans took 6 of the top 7 places.

Without double champion Alistair Brownlee and Ironman superstar Jan Frodeno, the short-distance field was searching for a new hero. During the COVID pandemic only a very limited number of international races could be held, so the actual condition of the competitors was basically uncertain. The 2020 World Champion, with three World Cup wins in autumn 2020, was the Frenchman Vincent Luis, while the Norwegian Kristian Blummenfelt and Jonathan Brownlee won the two World Cups in May 2021. The winner of the World Series event in Leeds one month before the games was Alex Yee.
For swimming the men had to navigate the warm 30 degree water in Tokyo’s Odaiba Bay, right next to the Rainbow Bridge. Outside of the water, however, the conditions were acceptable with an air temperature of 27 degrees and a humidity of 67 percent.
The race started with an incident. While a camera boat was still filming the participants, the race management gave the start command. Part of the field jumped into the water, but the way for many athletes was blocked by the boat, so they stopped at the pontoon. Several triathletes had already started swimming and had return to the start, which took a considerable amount of time. The race got underway safely around 10 minutes later.
Vincent Luis was the first out of the water after the first swim lap of 950 metres heading back to the second lap of 550 metres. The pack, however, was only seconds behind. He was able to hold this position and finished swimming in front of Dmitry Polyansky and Jonas Schomburg.
The bike part started with a small lead group of five athletes, which eventually grew larger in the first lap with a few athletes sprinting inside to form a pack of nine, but a second chase group was only a few seconds behind. In the fourth lap these groups finally merged. Stefan Zachaus tried to escape, but was caught up quickly. Now a third group also joined, so that almost the entire field rode together for the rest of the race. In the middle of the bike course Schomburg had massive bad luck. Luis Knabl tore off the rear derailleur right in front of him and Schomburg lost contact with the main group. The pace slowed down a bit, so that Swiss Andrea Salvisberg was able to pull away, opening a lead of 21 seconds at the end of lap five. This gap was reduced to only 14 seconds out of the second transition zone after the bike.
Salvisberg was soon caught on the run and an elimination race began. Alex Yee headed the field now for most of the run and gradually accelerated, but could not get rid of all his rivals. With 1 km to go in the last run lap, Kristian Blummenfelt dropped Yee and initiated the decisive attack. Yee could not match the Norwegian’s speed, who began celebrating his greatest career success 200 metres before the line and was overwhelmed by his win at the finish before he was carted away from the finish area in a wheelchair. Behind the two top finishers New Zealand’s Hayden Wilde crossed the line in a comfortable third position. For Norway it was the first triathlon medal in Olympic history and the first summer gold since 2012.

It took the individual preference votes of the judges to decide that the Briton, despite having been given two standing counts, was the winner.
Ogogo’s winning run was snapped in the semi-final by Esquiva Florentino of Brazil who was one of two brothers who won medals at boxing in Beijing. The other semi-final was a close affair that was awarded to Ryota Murata of Japan over Abbos Atayev of Uzbekistan by a single point. One point was also the margin that decided the final and again it was the Japanese fighter who came out on top. An appeal on behalf on Florentino was denied by the AIBA.

Bilozerchev had been severely injured in a 1985 motorcycle accident, almost losing his left leg, and he was not expected to compete again, much less win further World titles.
In Seoul, the Soviets had the top four qualifiers, and five of the top six, but could only advance three to the final round. They swept the medals quite easily, with Vladimir Artyomov winning the gold medal, Valery Lyukin silver, and Bilozerchev bronze. They not only led the qualifying but those three had the highest scores in the final round as well. Their dominance can be shown by the margin of Bilozerchev over fourth-place finisher Sven Tippett of East Germany, which was almost a complete point (0.975).
This was only the second time, after the Japanese in 1972, that a nation swept the medals in this event at the Olympics. In fact, it became impossible to do in 2004 when the rules were changed allowing only two gymnasts per nation to advance to the final round.

With the addition of the women’s 1,500 metre freestyle to the 2020 Olympic Program, FINA also lobbied to equalize the program and add the men’s 800, which was approved.
The favorite was the Italian distance specialist Gregorio Paltrinieri, who had won this event at the 2019 World Championships, and was the World 1,500 metre champion in 2015 and 2017. Also formidable was Ukraine’s Mykhailo Romanchuk. Romanchuk led the qualifiers with 7:41.28 just head of German Florian Wellbrock, who recorded 7:41.77, but the biggest shock was that Paltrinieri barely qualified, finishing eighth in 7:47.63, obviously resting for the final, but it almost cost him.
Paltrinieri made no such mistake in the final two days later, taking the lead on the first lap and holding it through 700 metres, followed by Wellbrock and Romanchuk for most of the race, although Wellbrock took the lead at 750 metres. American Robert Finke lingered back in fifth for most of the race, but at 750 metres he had moved into fourth and he looked to have a shot at a medal.
It was more than that. Finke shattered the field over the final 50, splitting 26.39, a last lap that was over 1½ seconds faster than the next fastest split (Australian Jack McLoughlin’s 28.00 back in fifth), and it brought Finke all the way to the top of the podium and a completely surprising gold medal. Paltrinieri held on for silver while Romanchuk took bronze.
American men’s distance swimming had been in the doldrums, as no USA male had won a gold medal in the 1,500 metres since Mike O’Brien in 1984. To prove that his 800 gold was no fluke, Finke would come back on the last day of swimming at the Tokyo Olympics and add a second gold in the 1,500 metre freestyle.

But Cripps brought up a knee and knocked the baton from Jackson’s hand. To her credit, Jackson caught the baton on the bounce, and ran on, but the delay proved disastrous, and Australia could only finish fifth. Germany then had the lead at the start of the anchor leg, but Cathy Hardy (USA) gained two metres to edge out Marga Petersen of Germany, both teams running world records of 45.9 – although the automatic time had the US with 46.14 to 46.18 for Germany. Pearl Jones ran the second leg for the United States, aged only 15 years, 123 days on the day of the final, and she remains the youngest athlete to have won an Olympic athletics gold medal.

Competitors losing to the finalists entered repechage tournament for bronze medals.,na,"The tournament for the men’s middleweight  Greco-Roman wrestling crown seemed as if it would shape up to be a battle between World Champions Selçuk Çebi of Turkey and Roman Vlasov of Russia. Çebi had been World Champion in 2009 and 2010, but was unseated in 2011 by Vlasov, who had just made the jump from the junior to the senior edition of the competition. While these two were the favorites for gold, attention was also given to Arsen Julfalakyan of Armenia who was vying to repeat the feat of his father Levon, who won a gold medal in the lightweight Greco-Roman category in 1988. Arsen had been eliminated in the 1/8 finals of the 2008 Summer Games, but had improved significantly since then with second and third-place finishes at the 2010 and 2011 World Championships respectively. If he won the gold medal in London, he would become part of the first father-son Olympic wrestling champions. The other 2011 World Championship bronze medalist, Neven Žugaj, was aiming to become the first Croatian Olympic wrestling medalist, while Christophe Guénot was the only returning Olympic medalist from the 2008 Games.
In a shocking turn of events, Çebi was eliminated in his opening match by Robert Rosengren, an unheralded wrestler from Sweden. The only question now was who would face Vlasov in the final, a call answered by Julfalakyan who, unlike Vlasov, never lost a round on his journey to the gold medal match. In the end, however, Vlasov demonstrated clear superiority over Julfalakyan, successfully defending against his opponent’s aggressive style and bringing each round to par terre, where his strength gave him the advantage in both the top and bottom positions. Vlasov successfully flipped, then defended, in this stage, winning the match in two rounds and claiming the top podium spot.
The first bronze medal match pitted Aleksandras Kazakevičius of Lithuania against Mark O. Madsen of Denmark, both veteran Olympians from 2008. Madsen was a three-time silver medalist at the World Championships (2005, 2007, and 2009) while Kazakevičius was fighting at a disadvantage, having injured his right eye in an earlier bout. Nonetheless the Lithuanian maintained his defenses throughout, bringing his opponent to par terre both times, and was able to successfully defend, and then convert, to win the match in two rounds and capture the bronze medal. In the second match, Aleksandr Kikinyov of Belarus, who had competed in the 2004 Summer Games and had a bronze medal from the 2009 World Championships, faced Emin Əhmədov of Azerbaijan, a rookie on the international scene. Each wrestler was able to convert their par terre top advantage to a point in the first two rounds, leading to a third round where, with points and cautions tied, a ball was drawn and Əhmədov was given the opportunity to choose his position in the third par terre. Selecting the top, the Azerbaijani was able to drive Kikinyov out of the ring for a point, although this ruling was unclear and challenged at first. Even when replays showed clearly that the Belarusian had stepped outside, however, Kikinyov refused to admit defeat or shake hands with his opponent. Regardless of these protestations, Əhmədov was awarded the bronze medal.

But he did not compete in 1932.
Without Nosseir present, Straßberger seemed to have a clear path to gold but the best he could do was win bronze behind two Czechoslvaks, Jaroslav Skobla and Václav Pšenička, Sr.. All the medals were closely fought, with Skobla taking gold over Pšenička by only 2.5 kg. Pšenička and Straßberger tied at 377.5 kg but Pšenička won the silver medal based on lower bodyweight. He would repeat as silver medalist at Berlin in 1936. Skobla’s son would win a bronze medal in the shot put at Melbourne in 1956.

Kołomański and Staniszewski performed the best of these pairs in the first run, finishing in fourth place, while the Matti brothers were eighth, Adisson and Forgues were tenth, and Šimek and Rohan were 14th. The top three spots went to André Ehrenberg and Michael Senft of Germany, twin brothers Petr and Pavel Štercl of the Czech Republic, and Emmanuel Del Rey and Thierry Saïdi of France. Of all of these teams, only the Štercl brothers failed to post a better mark in the second round, with the most dramatic increase being that of Šimek and Rohan, who went from 14th to a silver medal; only Adisson and Forgues bettered their score.

Hsu was not only the 2012 runner-up (and thus poised to become champion following Chinshanlo’s disqualification), but was also the reigning World champion and the 2014 runner-up. Romania’s Cristina Iovu, the 2012 Olympic bronze medalist and reigning European champion, also found herself entangled in a doping scandal and did not attend the 2016 Games. Other contenders included China’s Li Yajun, the 2013 World Champion and 2014 bronze medalist, and Hidilyn Diaz of the Philippines, the 2015 World bronze medalist. Yuliya Paratova of Ukraine, the 2013 and 2015 European champion and 2014 runner-up, competed in the flyweight division in Rio.
Li bested the Olympic record of her countrywoman Yang Xia, the 2000 Olympic champion, in the snatch with a 101 kg lift, but Hsu was only 1 kg behind. No other competitor lifted more than 90 kg, leaving Li and Hsu the only likely contenders for gold. In the clean and jerk, Li believed she had made a successful 123 kg lift and, far ahead of Hsu’s 112 kg first lift, attempted and failed 126 kg twice. The judges, however, had reversed their decision on Li’s 123 kg lift due to elbow bending and both Li and her coaches claimed not to have known this until after the competition had ended. Thus Hsu, who had failed to lift 126 kg in her second round, declined a third attempt and secured the bronze medal. Diaz also managed to record 112 kg in the clean and jerk, but her much lower snatch posting of 88 kg left her far behind overall in second place. Yoon Jin-Hee of South Korea, the 2008 Olympic runner-up who had returned in 2014 from a three-year retirement, nabbed bronze.

Both countries won their heats in the preliminaries and semi-finals to qualify for the A Final. The German four of Tom Liebscher, Max Lemke, Ronald Rauhe, and Max Rendschmidt won the gold medal after a close-fought race, ending just 0.226 seconds ahead of Spain. Slovakia finished third.
As for the German Team, this was the third gold medal for Rendschmidt and a second for Leibscher. They both were members of the German K-4 team that won Olympic gold at Rio in 2016.

Niemann had moreover won the distance at the past four European Championships, as well as the 1991 World Championships. At all tournaments, she had also taken the overall title. The world record holder was Yvonne van Gennip, with her winning time at the 1988 Olympics, but the Dutch skater had had poor showings in Albertville and withdrew from the 5,000 m due to a fever.
Warnicke started in pair three, racing against Carla Zijlstra of the Netherlands. Zijlstra had recently impressed with a third place in this distance at the European Championships, and was an outsider for a medal. She was no match for Warnicke, however, as the German quickly distanced herself from the Dutch skater. She finished in 7:37.59, versus 7:41.10 for Zijlstra. After an ice preparation, Niemann started. Taking advantage of the good conditions, she easily defeated her teammate and friend, with 7:31.57. Medals seemed divided, but the third German, Claudia Pechstein, still had to race. The 19-year-old had fallen at the longest distance in Heerenveen, but in Albertville she was in top shape. Chasing Zijlstra’s splits for the first half of the race, she opened a gap, increasing it to 1.3 seconds at the finish line. This gave the Germans a complete sweep of the medals. As in 1984, when German skaters won all medals in the 3,000 m, all three skaters were from East Germany. For Pechstein, her upset bronze medal would be the start of a successful Olympic career.

Colleen Miller and Wendy Wiebe of Canada had won the event at the last three editions of the Worlds and were the strong favorites to take the inaugural crown in Atlanta. In the opening round, however, they were outperformed by Constanţa Burcică and Camelia Macoviciuc of Romania, as well as Berit Christoffersen and Lene Andersson of Denmark. The Danes were the reigning World runners-up, while Burcică was a 1992 Olympic silver medalist in the quadruple sculls. The Canadians heat was also the slowest of the opening round, with both the Americans, 1994 World bronze medalists Lindsay Burns and Teresa Bell, and the Australians, Virginia Lee and Rebecca Joyce, posting faster times than the Romanians as they won their heats. The Americans and the Australians were again the heat winners in the semi-finals, the latter of whom helped to eliminate the favored Canadians. The situation turned again in the final, when Romania regrouped and captured the gold medal by a margin of nearly two seconds. The Americans, in winning silver, were almost two seconds ahead of the Australians, who battled the Italians down to the line to take bronze with only 0.27 seconds to spare.

Something that could not have been predicted was the sudden emergence of Cuban Robeisy Ramírez as a major force in the division. Certainly the 18-year-old Ramírez had been a major star as a junior and was already the Pan-American Games champion but he had been easily dealt with by Aloyan at the quarter-final stage at the last world championships. In London he performed like a seasoned veteran and moved imperiously through the rounds whilst dispatching Selby at the quarter-final stage. Aloyan was the victim of an upset in the semi-final so Ramírez instead faced Nyambayaryn Tögstsogt of Mongolia to decide the gold medal.
The final began with both men fighting cautiously and it was only in the final round that the Cuban teenager established a decisive lead.
The Cuban fighter became the first boxer to win titles at both the Youth Olympics and at the senior event, having won the bantamweight division (≤54 kg) at the inaugural 2010 Youth Olympics.

In light snowfall, with strong winds, and in freezing cold temperatures, both skiers showed their potential throughout the competition. They clocked the fastest times in the qualifying round, won their respective quarter-final heats and finished one-two, when they competed in the same semi-final. Laurien van der Graaff from Switzerland, twice sprint winner this season, but a specialist in the freestyle, did not qualify for the final, after finishing fifth in her semi-final.
In the final, Nilsson and Falla were confronted with another Swede, Hanna Falk, USA skier [Jessie Diggins](,  and two Olympic Athletes from Russia, Yuliya Belorukova and Nataliya Nepryayeva. Of these, only Belorukova could make any impact on the battle between the two favorites. She stayed on the heels of Nilsson when she started her attack in the second climb. Falla went past the Russian on the inside to move into second place. But Nilsson was clearly superior, and stormed to her first Olympic gold three seconds ahead of Falla. In the last descent, Belorukova closed in on Falla and both fought head-to-head on the final stretch. But Falla secured the silver 0.3 seconds ahead of Belorukova, who took home an unexpected bronze. Nepryayeva, Falk and Diggins were a considerable way behind in fourth, fifth and sixth place respectively.

Wei won the qualification round by equaling her own world record with 124, missing only one target. Bacosi finished second with 123, and English was third with 121. These three also occupied the medal positions after the final, starting from zero. The qualification places fourth to sixth were determined in a shoot-off, and the ranking was important for the final as the lowest placed was eliminated in the case of a tie. English was the last to miss a target in the final with her 16th shot but Bacosi was always close behind and took the lead after 30 shots.

By the 19th lap, these two were lapping runners and one of the runners they came upon on the 22nd lap was Morocco’s Hammou Boutayeb. Though he was lapped he suddenly found the strength to run with Chelimo and Skah, to the detriment of Chelimo. Writing in Track & Field News, Cordner Nelson noted, “In the next lap and a half, Boutayeb committed unarmed assault.” He bumped Chelimo several times, cut him off at least twice, and made him run over and around him several times. Shortly before the bell, IAAF Technical Delegate Carl-Gustaf Tollemar ran onto the track to warn Boutayeb to stop his tactics and appeared to try to stop him, to no avail. On the last lap, Skah was the fresher runner, and outsprinted Chelimo, his tank dry from having to fight off Boutayeb’s assaults. Boutayeb dropped out on the last lap. Shortly after the finish, Skah began a victory lap that was greeted by boos and detritus being thrown at him from the stands. Before he had finished the lap, the IAAF had disqualified him and declared Chelimo the winner. Moroccan officials immediately appealed the ruling, and the next day Skah was reinstated. On the victory podium two days later, the chorus of derision on the victory lap seemed mild compared to the abuse heaped on Skah.

The latter team was expected to feature 5000 m champion Chad Hedrick and eventual 1000 m champion Shani Davis. However, Davis forfeited his spot on the team to focus on individual events, at the displeasure of Hedrick, who had announced his goal of five golds prior to the Games. This incident was blown up by the US press, but Davis did not compete.
A weak time by the Americans in the ranking round left them drawn against Italy, who had been silver medalists at the first World Championships the previous year. Despite strong efforts by Hedrick, the Italians advanced to the semi-finals against the Dutch. In a close race, up and coming star Sven Kramer stumbled, taking a team mate with him and leaving the Italians certain of a medal. In the other semi-final, the well-trained Canadians easily outraced Norway.
In the final, the Italians were much stronger then their opponents, and grabbed their country’s first ever Olympic speed skating title. Italian newspaper reports of the victory spent much of their columns on explaining the sport to readers unfamiliar with it. Enrico Fabris was the team’s captain, having won Italy’s first ever bronze medal earlier that week in the 5000 m, and winning the 1500 m later in the Games. Ippolito Sanfratello, had been an inline skater for most of his career, but had switched to the ice to compete in the Olympics.

East Germany was not the defending Olympic champion, only because they joined the 1984 boycott, but they were the world record holders, had won the 1986 World Championships by a huge margin over the USA, and had won the last six European Championships. Kristin Otto opened for the GDR with a 55.11, leading American Mary Wayte by 0.77 seconds. Katrin Meißner then moved ahead by 1.72 seconds at the 200 metre mark and the race was over but the rout was on. On the third leg it was more of same for East Germany, but although well back, the Netherlands closed on the United States, as Conny van Bentum brought the margin for silver to only 8/100ths at the anchor exchange. On the final leg, Karin Brienesse swam the eighth fastest 100 relay split ever, 55.04, to bring the Netherlands home for the silver medal, with the United States trailing for third as China placed fourth. Van Bentum commented, “We thought we would be battling for third with China. We were really, really excited that we got second.” The East Germans missed their world record by 6/100ths.

The race was more suited to climbers because of the severity of some of the climbs, including the 14 km ascent on Mount Fuji.
The leading contenders in Tokyo were the No. 1 and 2 ranked Slovenians, the 2020 and 2021 Tour de France winner Tadej Pogačar, and former world junior champion ski-jumper Primož Roglič, winner of the Vuelta a España in 2019 and 2020. The defending Olympic champion Greg Van Avermaet of Belgium was hoping to become the first man to successfully defend his title. South America’s best chance was with Ecuador’s Richard Carapaz, who came to the Games having finished third in the Tour de France, while Spain’s Alejandro Valverde could never be discounted. Great Britain had a strong team, with three Grand Tour winners in their squad. They had the 2018 Tour de France winner Geraint Thomas, that year’s Vuelta a España winner Simon Yates, and the 2020 Giro d’Italia winner Tao Geoghegan Hart.
Two of the British riders, Hart and Thomas, were involved in a crash in the early part of the race that left them trailing at the back of the field, before they both eventually pulled out of the race. For the 35-year-old Thomas it was the third major race in succession in which he was involved in a collision, following ones at the Giro d’Italia, and the Tour de France just three weeks before the Olympics.
Raced in warm and very humid conditions, a five-man group broke away and built up a 20-minute lead but, on the severe climb up Mount Fuji, that lead was gradually reduced. The climb was too much for the 41-year-old Spaniard Valverde, and the 2018 world champion quit the race. With 48km to go, the breakaway group was pulled back and joined the peloton, before three men, including the Italian Vincenzo Nibali, formed another breakaway. With a little more than an hour to go, however, the two-time Tour de France winner Pogačar took the lead, but a group of riders went with him, including the Belgian Wout van Aert, to prevent the Slovenian building up a big lead. Canada’s Mike Woods and Britain’s Adam Yates joined the leaders before Carapaz and Brandon McNulty (USA) pulled clear and built up a 20-second lead, which they extended thanks to working together and, with so many riders tiring, it looked like Carapaz and McNulty would fight for gold and silver.
Going into the final 7 km, however, their lead was down to less than 20 seconds and, at around 6 km, Carapaz made a solo break from the tiring McNulty, who was rapidly overtaken by the chasing group. Carapaz raced away around the Fuji Speedway, where James Hunt clinched the 1976 World Formula One title, to win by 1:07, and become only the second Olympic gold medallist from Ecuador after Jefferson Pérez in the 20 km walk in 1996. It was then down to eight men to fight it out for the two other medal places and it was Britain’s Adam Yates who made the break for the line but, after a frantic sprint, it was the Belgian van Aert and Pogačar who took bronze and silver respectively. A photo-finish revealed that Van Aert took silver by the width of a tyre. Because of the intense heat and humidity, only 85 of the 128 starters finished the race.

At the 1924 Olympics he was incensed by a decision in the sabre competition, and withdrew from the event, and his entire Italian fencing team then withdrew. By a decision of the IOC, Puliti was then banned from future Olympic participation, but two years later, after a request by the Italian fencing federation, this decision was reconsidered and Puliti was allowed to compete in 1928.
Both he and France’s Lucien Gaudin were undefeated in qualifying for the final pool. There Puliti lost three matches to drop to fourth place, while Gaudin had nine wins and two losses, tying him with Erwin Casmir (GER) and Giulio Gaudini (ITA). Casmir had beaten Gaudin in their pool match but in the barrage for medals, Gaudin reversed that outcome. He then faced Gaudini. With the score tied 2-2, Gaudini grazed Gaudin’s jacket but the referee ruled “no touch”. The Italians immediately protested but Gaudin walked over to the jury and magnanimously told them, “I was touched”. Gaudini went ahead 4-2, but Gaudin came back to win the final three points, winning the match 5-4, and secure the gold medal. Gaudini also lost to Casmir, which gave the German the silver medal.
Gaudin was competing in his third Olympics and competed in six events. He won a medal in all six, with four golds. Six days after this victory, he won the individual épée in Amsterdam, only the second time that a fencer would win both the individual foil and épée at the same Olympics (after Ramón Fonst (CUB) in 1904). This was Gaudini’s second Olympics, after competing in team foil in 1924, and he would compete again in 1932 and 1936, and finish his Olympic career with nine medals – three gold, four silver, and two bronzes. Erwin Casmir was the greatest German fencer of the 1920s. He would also compete in 1932 and 1936 but this would be his only individual Olympic medal.

Deeper placements based on placements in earlier rounds, and best time skated.",na,"As is common in short track speed skating, the South Koreans were favored in this event. With Lee Ho-Seok, they entered the reigning world champion in the event. He was joined by two team mates, Seong Si-Baek and Lee Jeong-Su. The three Koreans demonstrated their might in the semi-finals, as they all won their respective heats. They were joined in the final by Apolo Anton Ohno (USA), the 2002 champion, Liang Wenhao (China), Olivier Jean (Canada), who qualified after being interfered with in the semi-finals, and J. R. Celski (USA).
With three men in the final, the Koreans were determined to make it a clean sweep. Their plan appeared to work perfectly, as they were occupying the first three places going into the final lap. While Lee Jeong-Su was leading, Lee Ho-Seok attempted to pass his two team mates on the inside of final curve. But he went too fast, and crashed out of the curve, dragging Seong along with him. Instead of three Koreans on the podium, only Lee Jeong-Su was left, who did take the gold. Behind him, Ohno and Celski took medals for the United States.
For Ohno, it was his sixth Olympic medal, the highest total for any short track skater, and also the highest for any American Winter Olympian (although Bonnie Blair, who he passed, had won more gold medals). Celski’s bronze medal was also remarkable. During the US Olympic Trials, he had crashed badly, severely cutting his thigh with his skate, which required some sixty stiches, and it seemed uncertain if he would skate again. With the help of Dr. Eric Heiden, Celski recovered in time for the Vancouver Olympics.
A notable participant in the B-final was Latvia’s Haralds Silovs. The 1,500 m European Champion for 2008 and 2009, he had competed in the 5,000 m on the long track earlier in the day, becoming the first Olympian to combine both speed skating variants at the same Games - and on the same day.

Her biggest competition would be Poland’s Marta Walczykiewicz, who had been runner-up to Carrington at the Worlds for the last four years and was also the 2013 European Champion. The 2012 Olympic runner-up was Inna Osypenko-Radomska, who had competed for Ukraine in London but was a member of the Azerbaijani delegation in Rio.

Walczykiewicz, Osypenko-Radomska, and Carrington went on to win their semifinals, while Guyot came in second behind the Azerbaijani. Liepa, meanwhile, was eliminated. In the final, Carrington had little trouble holding off Walczykiewicz for the gold medal and set an Olympic record of 39.864.

Unfortunately for France this meant that, although they were seventh in the nations ranking table, their inability to qualify their skaters in a minimum of three of the four events ruled them out and let 17th ranked Ukraine take their place. Of the 10 teams involved, Ukraine and Germany were affected by positive cases of COVID-19 among their teams and had little chance of progressing to the final five.
The Russian Olympic Committee team were the favourites based on the performance of Russia in winning the World Team Trophy in April 2021 and they proved to be consistently competitive across all disciplines.  Across all eight segments of the competition, the ROC only placed outside the top two on one occasion and, led by the brilliant 15-year-old Kamila Valiyeva, they were emphatic winners of the Olympic title, with the USA and Japan trailing in their wake in silver and bronze positions.
On the day the medals were decided, however, the IOC mysteriously announced that the medal ceremony would not immediately take place. The media reported that this was because a doping irregularity connected to the winning team.  Eventually the International Testing Agency confirmed that Kamila Valiyeva had tested positive for trimetazidine at the Russian Championships in December.
The case was sent to the Russian Anti-Doping Agency for a provisional decision but, at time of writing, the official results could not be verified by the IOC. As of April 2022 the gold medal allocation remains in the air between the ROC and the USA and could very well take months or years to clarify (in May 2023 it was announced that a hearing will begin in August 2023). The US team petitioned the Court of Arbitration for Sport that the IOC should be ordered to present to them their silver medals before the end of the Games but this application was dismissed by the court.

It was 107 km shorter than the men’s race.
In both the women’s road race and time trial, it was difficult to see anybody toppling the strong Netherlands pair of Anna van der Breggen and Annemiek van Vleuten, the world’s No. 1 and 2 female road racers. Van der Breggen was the defending champion and was hoping to become the first women’s two-time road race champion. She also won the Giro d’Italia Femminile four times between 2015-21. The three World Road Race Championships between 2018-20 had been won by either van Breggen (twice) or van Vleuten (one). Van Vleuten had also won the Giro d’Italia Femminile twice, and between 2015-21 the pair had won four of the six races.
The Netherlands also had two other possible medal contenders at Tokyo in Marianne Vos and Demi Vollering, while the best of the other riders included Italy’s Elisa Longo Borghini (the daughter of Italian cross-country skier Guidina Dal Sasso), and Denmark’s Cecilie Uttrup Ludwig, bronze medallist at Rio, and 2020 World Championship bronze medal winner.
With barely 2km raced, five riders unusually made a break. With 40 km gone, the breakaway became four and was made up of Carla Oberholzer (South Africa), Anna Kiesenhofer (Austria), Omer Shapira (Israel), and Anna Plichta (Poland) and, with 70 km to go, was reduced to three with Carla Oberholzer dropping back and, all of a sudden, the three leaders had more than a 10-minute lead on the peloton. Remarkably, one of the breakaway trio, Austria’s Kiesenhofer, made a solo break 40 km from the finishing line, which was something she had always planned to do.
Two members of the original breakaway group, Shapira and Plichta, stayed in contention but Kiesenhofer kept pulling away as the chasers were eventually caught by the pack headed by the strong Dutch riders. Gold looked inevitable for the Austrian rider and van Vletuten set off in search of the silver to make amends for her horrific crash 6 km from the finish in Rio when she had gold in her sights. She was rewarded with second place in Tokyo, with Italy’s Elisa Longo Borghini crossing the line for a second successive bronze medal. One of the lasting memories from the 2020 Olympics was van Vleuten crossing the finishing line raising her arms believing she had won gold, unaware that honour had already gone to Kiesenhofer over a minute earlier. Perhaps it would have been a different story had radio technology been allowed at the Olympics.
Victory for Kiesenhofer was the unlikeliest in women’s Olympic road race history. She obtained a maths degree from Cambridge University and went into the Games without a major professional cycling contract. She came away from the Games as the first Austrian cycling medallist since Adolf Schmal back in 1896, the first Austrian, male or female, to win a road race medal, and the first Austrian female to win a medal in any cycling discipline.

Carlos came off the turn 1½ metres in the lead but Smith then accelerated, turning on what he called his “Tommie Jets” and powered past the field to win with almost a 2½ metre lead despite closing it down in the last 10 metres, still running a world record 19.83. Carlos slowed near the end after Smith passed him and the gold medal was gone, and was passed on the run-in by Australia’s Peter Norman.
Smith and Carlos almost did not compete in the Olympics. African-Americans, they considered joining a black boycott of the Olympics that was being organized by San José State professor Harry Edwards. But they elected to make their own protest instead. On the victory podium, they mounted it barefoot, wearing civil rights badges, and as The Star-Spangled Banner played, they lowered their heads and raised a single, black-gloved fist. The IOC was irate at this political protest during the Olympics, and the US Olympic Committee expelled them from the team. Peter Norman joined them in the protest by also wearing the civil rights badge. Vilified by the American and international media, Smith and Carlos have since become heroes to the cause of American civil rights, and human rights in general. They also never forgot Norman, and when he died in 2006, they served as pallbearers at his funeral. In 2008 Smith and Carlos received the Arthur Ashe Courage Award at the ESPYs, presented by ESPN. Carlos has made some noise in recent years, claiming he let Tommie Smith win the gold medal in 1968, but those who saw the race have no doubt as to Smith’s dominance.

However, when Grospiron returned in late 1993 he won four of the five World Cups prior to Lillehammer, setting up a battle between the two. Brassard and Grospiron went 1-2 in the qualifying, setting up the expected battle. Skiing next-to-last in the final, Grospiron posted by far the fastest run, but lost some form near the end of his run. The points he lost for that dropped him behind Russian Sergey Shupletsov, who led as Brassard took the course. Brassard skied conservatively and carefully, posting the third slowest time of the 16 finalists, but his turns were carved nicely, for which he received a perfect 15.0, with 5.0 from all but the French judge, which boosted him to the gold medal. Shupletsov won silver and Grospiron the bronze. A little over a year later, Shupletsov was killed in a motorcycle accident.

The World silver and bronze medal-winning nations of Czechoslovakia and Norway were represented by Ladislav Čepčianský and Knut Østby respectively, the latter of whom was the 1948 Olympic runner-up. Much of the race consisted of Fredriksson being in front, with Hatlaczky making attempts to narrow the gap and Germany’s Michel Scheuer, the 1952 bronze medalist, not far behind. Neither Hatlaczky nor Scheuer was able to get the best of the man ahead of him, however, and thus these three crossed the finish line in that order. Fredriksson would add to his gold medal collection the following day, when he won the K-1 1000, while Strömberg, suffering from stomach problems, finished fourth.

In fact, the British time of 6:34.4 would only have been good enough for third place in the other heat, behind the Americans and the Canadians. Both Britain and Canada survived the repêchage, but the gold medal race soon became a fight between the Americans and the Italians, the former of whom bested their opponents by two-tenths of a second. Italy, who had led until the halfway mark and returned to that position 300 metres away from the finish, settled for silver while Canada battled Great Britain down to the wire and handed the favorites a surprising defeat by taking the bronze medal with a margin of 0.4 seconds.

She would be supported by teammates that included Nicole Cooke, who had won the 2008 Olympic road race, and Emma Pooley, a former British road race titleholder and Olympic time trial medalist. The favorite in the race, however, was considered to be Marianne Vos of the Netherlands who, among numerous other accolades, had won the Olympic Points Race four years earlier in Beijing, the last two editions of the Giro d’Italia Femminile, and silver medals in the road race at the last five World Championships (in addition to her victory at the 2006 edition). Other strong competitors were Italy’s Giorgia Bronzini, who was the World Champion in the event in 2010 and 2011, Shelley Olds of the strong United States team, and Germany’s Ina-Yoko Teutenberg, the bronze medalist from the 2011 World Championships, all of whom were thought to be capable of a powerful sprint finish. A notable absence was France’s Jeannie Longo-Ciprelli, who had appeared in every edition of the Olympic women’s road race since its inception in 1984 (a then-joint record of seven appearances for a woman) and was its champion in 1996.
London rains soaked the course before and throughout the race and helped keep the breakaways down during the first 100km. With 40 km left to go, however, an otherwise innocuous breakaway by Russian Olga Zabelinskaya turned into a serious threat when she was joined by Vos and, soon after, Armitstead and Olds. When Olds punctured a tire, the field was reduced to three and the breakaway was firmly established, the intermittent downpours now working in the leaders’ favor by keeping the rest of the pack at bay. The final moments came down to the strong sprinting powers of Vos and Armitstead and, in the end, Vos took home the gold. Armitstead’s silver finish was Britain’s first medal of the Games and was followed later in the day by a bronze from Becky Adlington in the Women’s 400 metre freestyle. Zabelinskaya finished in third for the road race bronze, following the footsteps of her father Sergey Sukhoruchenkov, who had won the men’s road race at the 1980 Summer Olympics.

Māris Štrombergs of Latvia had won gold at each of the two preceding Games but world champion Joris Daudet of France and young Dutchman Niek Kimmann were more favoured for success in Rio.
Daudet topped the time sheets in a relatively uneventful qualifying session; however, the quarter-finals could not remotely be called uneventful. The first heat saw Daudet crash in two of his three runs and be eliminated whilst Kimmann survived only by carrying what remained of his bicycle after a bone crunching crash in his second race. Štrombergs’ chance of a third successive title ended in a pile-up that caused 2013 world champion Liam Phillips  to be stretchered off with concussion and a broken collarbone. Another crash in the first run of the third heat saw two more cyclists withdraw with injury.
The semi-final stage was dominated by the two Australians, Sam Willoughby  and Anthony Dean, who were both undefeated in their respective semi-finals and would start the final as joint favourites.
The American pair of Connor Fields  and Nic Long eclipsed the Aussie pairing at the start and sped away from the field. Fields held the lead from start to finish while Long saw his dream of an Olympic medal foiled in the final straight as first Jelle van Gorkom and then Carlos Ramírez edged ahead of him. Fields, a student at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas was the first American Olympic champion at this discipline.

The Canadians won the round robin phase, despite a 6-5 defeat to China. Sweden advanced to the semi-final stage with seven wins. China, despite starting with a 5-4 defeat to Great Britain, rallied to finish third with six wins. Even more remarkable was Mirjam Ott’s Switzerland team who lost their first three matches, but a run of six straight wins ensured they were the fourth semi finalist.
In the semi-finals, Sweden and China were close until the fifth end when Sweden scored three points to take a 6-1 lead. Although China pulled this back to 6-3, a further three points at the eighth end effectively won the game for Sweden. In the end they won the match 9-4. The other match was a far closer event although Canada were never behind. Leading 6-4 as they came to the final end, Switzerland could only pull one point back, losing 6-5.
In a high-scoring contest for the bronze medal, China went into an early 5-1 lead, before the experienced Swiss side levelled the scores at 6-6 after six ends. However China scored two points on the seventh end, and a further score of four in the eighth end resulted in a 12-6 lead for China, when Switzerland conceded the game.
A tense final saw Sweden edge into a 4-2 lead at the halfway stage. However tenacious play by Cheryl Bernard’s Canadian team saw them slowly amassing points to lead 6-4 with one end to play. With her last two stones, Anette Norberg (SWE) managed to gain the two points required to take the game into an extra end. With the tension mounting, Bernard had to clear two stones with her final throw for victory, but she was only able to clear one, leaving the other Norberg stone in the house and enabling Sweden to win 7-6, so successfully defending their Olympic title.
Norberg’s team had struggled in the years between Olympic Games, a fact she put down to “Divorces and babies. Two of each”.
Although she threw only a couple of stones at the end of one of the pool games Canadian reserve Kristie Moore made a small piece of Olympic history in Vancouver. She was five and a half months into her pregnancy, the most advanced stage of any Olympic competitor.
Despite only winning three of their nine matches the Russian women also generated headlines in Vancouver. Nicknamed the “Moscow Ice Maidens” their glamorous image did much to erase the traditional view of curling and of Russian sportswomen in general which has lingered since the days of the Press sisters, Irina  and Tamara.

Earlier she had watched fiancé Tony Yoka reach his own Olympic final by beating a Croatian opponent before herself fighting for gold. The consensus was that Yin led at the halfway point before Mossely came back strongly in the second half of the fight.

The list of medal contenders appeared longer than for any previous Olympics. While the Central European powers were still strong, a new generation of drivers from outside the traditional bobsleigh zone were threatening to break through.  Gustav Weder had driven Switzerland I to the 1993 World Championship and the two-man event at Lillehammer and was a major medal threat but so were the German crews headed by Wolfgang Hoppe and Harald Czudaj, and Brian Shimer of the USA had taken the 1993 World Cup title. Shimer’s reign as title holder had been ended in 1994 by the brilliant young Canadian Pierre Leuders and also challenging the established powers were Great Britain.
Shimer, driving USA II, had a disastrous Olympics as a poor first run was followed by the ignominy of disqualification for having runners that were warmer than legally permitted. Lueders’ Canadians failed to spark and once again it was left to Germany and Switzerland to monopolise the podium.
Harald Czudaj had been a favourite at the 1992 Games but his preparations were ruined when it was revealed shortly before competition began that he acted as an informer for the Stasi, the East German secret police, for a number of years in the 80s in exchange for dropping a drunk-driving charge. Free from the worries of Albertville he was never headed though his lead was never more than 0.12 seconds throughout. Behind Czudaj’s Germany II bob came Weder’s Swiss world champions and the trio of medallists was completed by Wolfgang Hoppe piloted Germany I. This was Hoppe’s sixth and final Olympic medal and he retired with a tally of two gold, three silver and a bronze.
Jamaica’s appearance at the 1988 Olympics in Calgary had been considered a novelty but in Lillehammer they not only finished in the top half of the field but also defeated sleds from more traditional bobsleigh nations such as the United States, Italy and France. Last of the 29 finishers were the crew from Bosnia-Herzegovina who were competing just two years after the nation gained its’ independence and while fighting was still taking place in the country. The quartet was a multi-ethnic one comprising two Bosnian Muslims, an ethnic Croat and an ethnic Serb and competed using a sled donated by the Dutch.

In the final, two days later, the conditions were difficult, with air temperature around minus 10 celsius and with varying wind. In the first round, the Pole Stefan Hula held a surprising lead, after a jump of 111 m. He was followed by his compatriot Stoch and the Norwegian Johann André Forfang, who were equal in second place. Wellinger was still in contention, lying in fifth place, with the German Richard Freitag fourth.
In the second round, Robert Johansson of Norway, lying 10th after the first round, equaled the hill record with a jump of 113.5 m.  With five jumpers to go, Johansson was still leading, but was overtaken by Wellinger, who put in a stylish jump, also 113.5 m. Freitag could not respond, dropping to ninth place, but Forfang passed Johansson with a good second jump, but not good enough to catch Wellinger. With the two Poles remaining, defending champion Stoch had a disappointing jump and ended without a medal. Hula, in spite of rather good wind conditions, could not live up to his first jump, and finished behind Stoch. Andreas Wellinger, who won two silver medals in the 2017 World Championships, claimed his first international championships gold medal in a tough competition under difficult conditions. Simon Ammann, double gold medalist in 2002 and 2010, was called back from the start gate four times before his last jump and finished in 11th place.

But by 1964 he had settled in the United States, first as a student at the University of Southern California, and then as an actor in Los Angeles. He elected not to return for the Australian Trials in February, and Australian swimming officials responded by not allowing him on the Olympic team. He might have contended for gold in Tokyo, but American Don Schollander would have been difficult to beat. On 31 July he had broken Rose’s world record, posting 4:12.7, and was considered the favorite. In the final he trailed Roy Saari at 100 metres but pulled away to lead at 200 metres and then kept extending his lead, finishing in 4:12.2 to better his own world record. He was behind his world record pace at 300 metres, but finished in 1:01.7 for the record.

The three Americans, John Flanagan, Truxtun Hare, and Josiah McCracken, completely outclassed their two Swedish rivals.  In fact, the unfamiliarity of the Swedes with the event caused some amusement among the spectators, and also a good deal of apprehension.  Several times the uncontrolled crowd was seen to scatter as an errant throw headed their way.
For Flanagan, it was the first of three consecutive Olympic titles in the event, a mark only surpassed in athletics by Al Oerter in the discus and Carl Lewis in the long jump.  Flanagan was a much titled athlete.  He won championships in Britain, the United States, and Ireland in the hammer, and the weight throw, and also placed well in the shot put and the discus at several major competitions.  Amazingly for a man of his size (5-10 [1.78 metres], 220 lbs. [100 kg.]), he finished second in both the high and long jump and the all-around at the 1895 Irish Championships.
Truxtun Hare (this is the correct spelling) was better known in America as a footballer, as he had been named several times to Walter Camp’s All-American teams.  The third American, Josiah McCracken, later became a missionary doctor in China, and started one of the first medical schools there.

There were 18 entrants in this event with 14 starters, although we have not been able to identify all starters. The competition started at 1.20 m and initially advanced by 10 cm increments. All competitors cleared through 1.50 metres. The horses and riders were allowed three attempts at each successive height, as with human high jumping. The 1900 Olympic title was shared at 1.85 metres by Italian Giangiorgio, Count Trissino, aboard Oreste and Frenchman Dominique Gardères, who rode Canéla (owned by Count Oscar Heeren). Riding a different horse, Mélepo, Trissino also finished fourth in this event. There was a jump-off to decide the third and fourth places between Count Trissino and Georges Van Der Poele, aboard Ludlow.
The best on record in this era was 2.40 metres set by Heatherbloom, ridden by Dick Donnelly at Richmond, Virginia in 1902, although Heatherbloom and Donnelly had unofficial marks in 1902 of 2.49 and 2.515 metres. However, the first recognized FEI (Fédération Équestre Internationale) high jump record was 2.35 metres by Conspirateur, ridden by Captain Crousse (FRA) at the Grand Palais in Paris on 12 April 1906. The final FEI recognized high jump record in the 20th century was 2.47 metres by Huaso, ridden by Alberto Larraguibel Morales at an international show in Santiago, Chile on 5 February 1949.
A more modern variant of this event is now contested, termed the puissance. It is also a high jump event but with some differences in the details of the fences and the competition. The current indoor record for puissance is held by German rider Franke Sloothaak, who in June 1991 jumped 2.40 metres in Chaudfontaine, Belgium, riding Optiebeurs Golo.

He started out at world record pace (25.38 to the wall), and increased it, winning in 54.27, a full 1.29 seconds ahead of Canada’s Bruce Robertson. Spitz had his fourth gold medal and his fourth world record in Munich. There were 38 other swimmers in this event, and seven other finalists – nobody noticed.

After the first round of jumping he moved up a further two places with only Sara Algotsson of Sweden standing between him and a gold medal. Jung produced another classy display of jumping to ramp up the pressure but Algotsson’s nerve held steady until she made an error and dislodged a pole at the very last fence, giving Jung the gold medal.

Many people considered that the US might possibly sweep the medals, but the dangerous nature of hurdling made it understood that anything could happen. When the three Americans won their respective semi-finals, however, the sweep talk only increased.
In the end, what did happen was a US sweep, the first ever in this event at the Olympics, and the first ever Olympic sweep by American women in athletics. It was also only the third Olympic medal sweep in a women’s running event, after the 1980 800 metres, by the Soviet Union, and the 2008 100 metres, by Jamaica. Gold went to Brianna Rollins who ran 12.48, to narrowly defeat Nia Ali (12.59) and Kristi Castlin (12.61). Britain’s Cindy Ofili was 2/100ths off the podium.

Six dives. Final round only.,na,"Since its launch at the 2000 Olympics, China has won three of the four men’s synchronized springboard gold medals and Qin Kai was hoping for a third consecutive gold medal with Cao Yuan, with whom he won the 2015 world title. Qin had an outstanding record in springboard diving, particularly the synchronised event. He was the individual silver medalist at London in 2012 and was the synchronised gold medalist in 2008 and 2012 and the gold medal winner at all five biennial World Championships between 2007-15. He came to the Games with an impressive string of results in 2016, having won the synchronised title at all three World Series events in Windsor (Canada), Dubai and Beijing. On each occasion he was partnered by Cao Yuan and it was difficult to see gold going anywhere other than to those two. Cao was a 10-metres synchronised gold medalist in 2012, but did not defend his title, entering the 3-metre event instead. The only serious threat to the Chinese divers seemed to be coming from the Russians Ilya Zakharov and Yevgeny Kuznetsov, runners-up in London 2012 and second to Kai and Yuan at the 2015 World Championship, where the British pair Jack Laugher and Chris Mears won bronze.
The water in the pool was still the murky green colour it had mysteriously become, but it did not bother Kai and Yuan. It looked as though the Chinese clean sweep of diving golds would continue after the first two rounds when they led from Laugher and Mears and the American duo Sam Dorman and Mike Hixon. Round three saw the fancied Russians fall further behind after a bad dive and, unusually, the same happened to the Chinese pair as the British lads dived into the lead ahead of China and the United States.
The fourth round saw heavy rain blowing across the board but the America pair were not affected as they went ahead of China and into the silver medal position. The fifth series of dives saw the Chinese pair back into second place while the British duo held on to a 2.64 point lead. Another disastrous round by the Russians, who registered only 63.00 points, saw the 2012 silver medalists out of contention.
The fifth round was shrouded with controversy. The Germans had dived first and their 81.60 temporarily put them in the lead. Next to go were the Mexican divers Jahir Ocampo and Rommel Pacheco. They just set off on their dive as the stadium lights came on and they completed their dive but insisted the lights had put them off and a re-dive was ordered so they climbed up to the board to take their dive again. At poolside, however, discussions were taking place and it was decided not to allow them a re-dive and they were called back down and after an eight-minute delay the Americans were next to dive. Fortunately the delay did not affect them as they scored a competition best 98.04 and become the new leaders. Great Britain and China, however, still had to dive.
Laugher and Mears put in a great dive and knew that more than 88 points would put them in the lead, which they did with a 91.20. Now only the Chinese could deprive them of gold but, by their normal high standards, Yuan and Kai only managed 83.22 and had to be content with bronze, as Great Britain won its first ever Olympic diving gold, the pair from the Leeds diving club adding this title to the European and Commonwealth ones they already held. For Mears the win had a far reaching significance because he faced life-saving surgery to have his spleen removed in 2009 and spent time in a coma. For China that dream of a clean sweep of medals was over.

This was despite his not finishing the final opening series race, discarding his points, knowing he was well ahead overall, and not wishing to interfere with the race for the other medals. Britain’s Nick Dempsey won the silver medal, despite a lackluster start in the early races. He won two races near the end to move into medal contention and then placed second in the medal race to earn the silver medal. Going into the final contest, Germany’s Toni Wilhelm was third but placed only ninth in the final race and dropped off the podium, as Poland’s Przemysław Miarczyński placed fourth in the medal race to move up to the bronze medal. The defending World Champion, Julien Bontemps of France, placed fifth, after struggling in the early rounds.
This was scheduled to be the final Olympic windsurfer event, after the event started at the 1984 Olympic Games, as the ISAF had voted to replace it with kitesurfing at the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro. But that ruling was challenged, and reversed in November 2012, and windsurfing will remain on the Olympic Program for 2016.

When the shouting, booing American fans, who had started for the ring, had been quieted by the Amsterdam police, the judges then announced they had made a mistake and Daley had in fact defeated Isaacs. Despite South African appeals, this decision was upheld.
The other semi-final also saw controversy. Irish boxer Frank Traynor was initially disqualified against Italy’s Vittorio Tamagnini. Following a protest it appears he was reinstated although some reports do not mention that. In any case, Tamagnini advanced to the final against Daley, where he handled the American, winning by decision to win the gold medal.

Behind these two, the competition for bronze was also close. Three competitors, Tammer, Leilands and a Frenchman, finished ex aequo with 497.5 kg. The tie was resolved with a “lift-off” in the double-handed clean & jerk, which Tammer won with 142.5 kg, ahead of Dannoux with 140. It is not known if Leilands also participated in the tie-break.

Their dominant position had been usurped by Germany, World Champions at the last three editions, who sent their reigning squad of Marco Geisler, Robert Sens, André Willms, and Stephan Volkert to the 2004 Summer Olympics, the latter two of whom were also Olympic champions in this event from 1992 and 1996. The Czech Republic was the current World runner-up, while Poland had been the 2002 runner-up and 2003 bronze medalist.

In the opening round, Germany, Poland, and the Czech Republic all outperformed each other as they won their heats, while the latter two were only 0.10 seconds apart in winning their heats in the semi-finals. This round also saw Germany come in second in Poland’s heat and Italy eliminated from the competition. In the final, the Czech Republic, Russia, and Poland had all moved to the front of the pack by the halfway point and had very little time between them. By the three-quarter mark, Russia had taken the lead unexpectedly and seemed to be tapping hidden reserves of strength as both Poland and the Czech Republic struggled to keep up. From this point, Poland faltered and Russia pulled away from the Czechs, taking a surprise gold medal, their first, and as of 2012 only, in Olympic rowing as an independent nation. Even still, the biggest shock was yet to come: the Czechs cruised in for a comfortable second-place finish but Ukraine, who had been over four seconds behind at the three-quarters mark, unleashed a fantastic drive and burst ahead of the Polish crew to steal bronze by a photo-finish margin of only 0.07 seconds. Germany, meanwhile, experienced severe difficulties during the final and was never in contention, a surprising result from the three-time reigning World Champion.

In 1932, the Fédération Internationale de Ski (FIS) had decided to permit instructors to compete in international competitions. At the IOC Session in Oslo in the winter of 1935, the IOC informed the FIS that paid ski instructors would not be allowed to participate in the Winter Olympics. One of the victims of this decision was the Austrian skier Toni Seelos, world champion in Alpine Combination in 1935. Seelos was also the coach for Christel Cranz, who won the women’s Alpine Combination in the 1936 games. According to contemporary reports, Seelos was a test skier in the first round in the slalom event in the Olympic Winter Games, and recorded a time 6 seconds better than the fastest time in the competition! Austria and Switzerland declined to enter a team in the men’s event in protest against the IOC decision to exclude the ski instructors from the Olympics.
Among the entries, he silver medalist in the combination at the 1936 World Championships, the French skier Émile Allais from Megève, was among the hottest names, together with the German favorites Franz Pfnür (gold in 1935 downhill) and Gustav Lantscher, the Austrian-born world champion in the 1932 downhill who received German citizenship in 1935. The home favorite Roman Wörndle and 17-year-old Rudi Cranz, the little brother of the Olympic champion Christel Cranz, completed the strong German team. Unlike Laila Schou Nilsen, the Norwegian Birger Ruud, Olympic champion in ski jumping 1932, was also a well known name among the alpine skiers. He won bronze in the Alpine Combined at the 1935 World Championships, and knew the slopes of Kreuzjoch quite well, since he had stayed in Garmisch for several months during the last two years, working as a very popular assistant in a local sport shop.
The men’s downhill course was 3,800 m. with a descent of 959 m., and the competition started at noon, one hour after the start of the women’s race. The four best placed in the competition were the first four to finish, and were the only competitors able to break the 5 minute barrier. With start number 1, Lantschner crossed the finishing line in 4:58.2. The next skier Allais came close, recording 4:58.8. With start number 3, Ruud made an excellent time of 4:47.4, taking the lead with a +10 second’s margin.  Pfnür, with start number 5, was unable to beat the Norwegian, but with the second best time of 4:51.8 he was in good position before the slalom event.
Two days later the slalom event was organized in Gudiberg, and the start and finishing points were the same as for the women the day before. The men however had to negotiate 33 gates, 10 more than the ladies. In the first round Ruud spoiled his medal chances by missing a gate – he had to climb back and also received a 6 seconds penalty – giving him a time over 20 seconds behind the leader. Pfnür had the best time in both rounds and won the gold medal easily. Lantschner secured a German double by keeping ahead of Allais in both rounds. Home favorite Wörndle was given a 6 seconds penalty in the second round and was unable to catch Ruud, and the young and talented Cranz was out of contention for medals after a 12 second penalty in the first round.  In the second round he was only 0.1 seconds behind the champion Pfnür.  Six years later both Wörndle and Cranz had become victims of the World War II, both losing their lives on the Eastern front as soldiers in the Wehrmacht.

Sweden’s Sixten Jernberg, silver medalist from 1956 and third in the World Championships 1958, was highly favored among the experts.

Hakulinen, apparently not in his best shape, was in fifth place, already 1:20 behind the leader. At 20 km, Jernberg was in the lead, still 22 seconds ahead of Rämgård, but the Swedish pair had increased the gap to the two Soviet skiers, who were now almost a minute behind the leader. Hakulinen had dropped to sixth place, 2.20 behind. At the final stage of the race, Jernberg was able to cling to his lead ahead of fast finishing Rämgård, only 13 seconds behind at the finishing line. Anikin secured the bronze medal, almost one and a half minute behind the two Swedes.
Rolf Rämgård finished his cross country skiing career after the 1962 season, aged only 27. He later became a Member of the Swedish Parliament Riksdagen, and served also as Minister of Sport in the Swedish Governement.

Fouhy and Oscarsson were second and third respectively in a heat won by Australia’s Ken Wallace, a relatively unknown canoeist who would go on to win the K-1 500. Germany’s Max Hoff, the 2008 European bronze medalist, took the other heat. In the medal round, Brabants took command and won the gold medal by a margin of over a second; he would add to his collection the following day by taking bronze in the K-1 500.

Also in contention was Romania, runner-up at the most recent Olympics and World Championships. These two nations took both the heats and the fastest times in the opening round, leading to a showdown in the final that Romania won in Olympic record time.

In addition another 35 skiers competed only in the combined event, making a total field for the day of 110 skiers, starting at 30 second intervals. The conditions were excellent, temperatures varying from – 2 to – 5 C.° around the course, which had an elevation change of 275 meters. The highly favored Scandinavian teams had made minor changes from their relay quartets. Most surprising perhaps, Finland had put Pekka Niemi onto the team instead of Klaes Karppinen, World Champion in the event in 1935. The Norwegians had entered the 1930 world champion Arne Rustadstuen instead of Sverre Brodahl, who had to be content with starting “only” in the Nordic combined. Oddbjørn Hagen and Olaf Hoffsbakken were entered for both events.
Of the early starters, Lukáš·Mihalák from Czechoslovakia was the first skier to beat 1-20 at the finish, and he was in the lead until Norway’s double world champion in Nordic Combined from 1934 and 1935, Oddbjørn Hagen, reached the finishing line in a time almost 3 and a half minutes faster. Neither Finland’s World Champion, Sulo Nurmela, nor the Swede, Martin Matsbo, could match Hagen, Matsbo finishing 1:29 behind. But the Swede Erik Larsson, nicknamed “Kiruna-Lasse” (he was a miner from Kiruna in Swedish Lapland), made the race of his life. Starting half a minute behind Rustadstuen, he caught the Norwegian early and pushed ahead mercilessly, beating Hagen’s leading time by 55 seconds. Of the late starters, Niemi was able to beat Matsbo by a scant margin and secure a bronze medal for Finland. The hero from the relay race Kalle Jalkanen, starting next to last wearing start number 111, had a bad day and could only finish in a disappointing 12th place, beaten by the Swedish Olympic champion by almost five minutes.
Larsson, only aged 23 when we won his Olympic gold, was born in a poor family in the Finnish speaking village of Kurravarra, 12 km. north-east of the mining town Kiruna.  Shortly after his Olympic gold, he ended his sport career, donating his prizes and Olympic medals to his local congregation, and became a leading Laestadian Christian preacher in Kiruna. His granddaughter Åsa Larsson became one of Sweden’s most well-known crime fiction authors.  Bronze medalist Niemi, born in Finnish Lapland, had a great year in 1937 when he was 50 km.

Gay had won the 100 and 200 at the 2007 World Championships and Powell was a two-time world record setter. But in May 2008 Jamaica’s Usain Bolt broke Powell’s world record when he ran 9.72 at a meet in New York. Formerly considered primarily a 200 runner, he made the 100 a highly anticipated showdown between the big three sprinters. Gay won the American Olympic Trials in 9.68, but it was wind-aided and could not count for record purposes. Unfortunately, in the 200 at the Trials, he pulled up with a hamstring problem, would not be at his best in Beijing, and did not get past the semi-finals.
But that almost certainly had no effect on the outcome of the final. Usain Bolt was not known as the fastest starter but at 30 metres he was about equal to Richard Thompson (TRI), when he accelerated seemingly into another world. By 80 metres he had a huge lead and he then shut it down, turning around, dropping his arms in celebration, and costing himself some time. But he still broke the world record with 9.69, winning by 0.20 over Thompson. Estimates of his potential time, had he run thru the tape, ranged as low as 9.55 and this was with zero wind assistance.

But this time few experts would put their money on the Soviet team. In the individual events, their best placing in the 20 km was a very disappointing 17th place. The sprint was a little better, the three Soviet competitors placing 5-10-11. But they had won the 1983 World Championships with two teenagers on their team, and three of the four team-members from 1983 were on the 1984 Olympic team. East Germany was considered by most experts as favorites, and Norway and West Germany were strong medal contenders.
The Soviets had put their most inexperienced athlete on the first leg, Dmitry Vasilyev, a 21-year-old from Leningrad who was competing in an international biathlon championship for the first time. He had a modest 32nd place from the 20 km race as his only international experience. But Vasilyev did well on his opening leg, giving his team a 1:06 lead over Finland. Czechoslovakia, East Germany and West Germany followed closely, only three seconds separating the teams from second to fifth. Norway was down in ninth place, over two minutes behind the leader. Their opening leg skier, Odd Lirhus, 1978 World Champion in 20 km, had trouble with his second shooting round and had to ski two penalty laps. On the second leg, Yury Kashkarov defended his team’s lead, but East Germany’s Frank-Peter Roesch gained over half a minute and was only 26 seconds behind at the exchange. Olympic sprint champion Erik Kvalfoss had brought Norway back into the fight for medals, moving into third, 56 seconds behind the leader, with West Germany in fourth place, 52 seconds behind Norway.
On the third leg, the Soviet Union’s most experienced man, Algimantas Šalna, ran into trouble on his second shooting round and had to ski two penalty laps. He was overtaken by East Germany’s Matthias Jacob, who sent anchorman Frank Ullrich out 19 seconds ahead of the Soviet’s 19-year-old Sergey Bulygin. Peter Angerer had brought West Germany into bronze medal position only 28 seconds behind the leader, but Norway’s Rolf Storsveen had also done well and was only 44 seconds behind, still in position for a medal. The leading quartet was now at least 3-4 minutes ahead of the rest of the field. Ullrich was clearly, as shown by his individual appearances, in far from his best skiing shape. Norway’s Kjell Søbak came strongly from behind, and before the last shooting round the Soviet Union, West Germany and Norway passed Ullrich. The three teams came into the final series of standing shots close together. Young Bulygin showed good nerves and had five hits in a row. Søbak and West Germany’s Fritz Fischer had to use two extra shots and left the shooting range together 15 seconds behind Bulygin. The young Siberian fought bravely and secured the Soviet Union their fifth Olympic relay gold in a row, 12 seconds ahead of Norway’s Søbak, who was able to keep Fischer 1.2 seconds behind at the finish in a close battle for silver. Frank Ullrich brought East Germany home to a disappointing fourth place, losing over 1½ minutes to his competitors on his last leg despite a good shooting day. The Olympic relay was Ullrich’s last appearance as an active biathlete, a sad end to a great career.

Although the Russians had been having a consistent rather than spectacular season, the prevailing suspicion was that they would be the team to beat at Sochi after having seemingly sacrificed results at the World Cup in favour of preparation on the Olympic track.
Aleksandr Zubkov and the Russia #1 sled lived up to their billing by leading from start to finish although they were pressured on the final run by the Latvian crew who recovered from a mediocre first run to come within a tenth of a second of the title. Holcomb’s US sled added a bronze to the gold he had won in Vancouver as he finished just .03 ahead of the 2nd Russian crew in a result that matched that of the two-man event in Sochi.

The report was released in two parts, in July and December 2016, and confirmed the allegations. In 2017 the IOC formed a commission to investigate this, headed by IOC Member Denis Oswald, and usually referred to as the Oswald Commission. In late October 2017 the Oswald Commission began to release its findings.
All eight members of the Russian bobsleigh teams, which originally finished first and fourth in this event were disqualified in November-December 2017. Appeals were made immediately to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS), but were partially denied and the Russian teams remained disqualified and the medals were re-allocated.
A special committee of the International Bobsleigh and Skeleton Federation (IBSF) was then charged with investigating these findings, but refused to acknowledge the disqualifications and allowed all the sliders to continue competing. The IOC was not happy with that ruling and the Executive Committee of the IBSF then appealed to the CAS, against its own sub-committee, to have that ruling overturned.

57191,"High Jump, Men",1920 Summer Olympics,7,Athletics,/editions/7/sports/ATH,15 – 17 August 1920,"Olympisch Stadion, Antwerpen",22 from 9 countries,na,na,"Dick Landon, Harold Muller and Bo Ekelund were the only jumpers to survive 1.90 metres, but only Muller cleared it on his first attempt.  Landon was the only jumper to clear the next height, 1.94 metres (6-4 3/8).  He made it on his second attempt, breaking the Olympic record of 1.93 (6-4) that had been set by Alma Richards in winning the gold medal at Stockholm in 1912.  Landon had met a U.S. diver on the boat to Antwerp, Alice Lord, and they fell in love and later married.  Muller was well known as one of the top collegiate football players in the United States.  At the 1920 AAU Championships, which doubled as the Olympic Trials, the order of finish had been 1) John Murphy (who finished 5th in Antwerp), 2) Landon, 3) Muller.
There is some dispute about the final height for Landon with his winning jump. It appears that after Landon, Muller, Ekelund cleared 1.90, they raised the bar to 1.94, which would break the Olympic record by 1 centimetre. Only Landon cleared the bar at that height. It seems it was then re-measured, and it appears that the Imperial measure was 6-4¼, which is almost exactly 1.9368, a mark that was seen in 1920 in the Belgian sporting paper, Vélo-Sport, and which is obviously only an extrapolation from 6-4¼ (it could not have been measured to the 1/10th of a millimetre).
It is not known if the height was also re-measured metrically, but both 1.935 and 1.936 are seen in 1920 reports, as follows: 1920 Official Report – 1.935; 1920 United States Olympic Committee Report – 1.935 (6-4 1/5); and 1920 Finnish Report (Seitsemannet Olympialaisat Kisat) – 1.936. It would seem that 1.936 is more correct, rounding down from 1.9368. The 1.935 mark may have been chosen as accurate to the nearest ½-centimetre, but it cannot be certain whether the correct height should be 1.935 or 1.936.

The IOC had recognized the FIVB as the governing body of beach volleyball, although most of the top men professionals played on the AVP Tour. The FIVB ruled that AVP players had to qualify via FIVB events. Originally only two teams per nations were to be allowed, but because of the dispute between the FIVB and AVP, three teams from any country could compete. The #1 seed was the Brazilian team of Lopes and Neto, who would finish only equal ninth. The big story in Atlanta was the two rival American teams from the competing tours. Sinjin Smith (Sinjin is short for his middle name of St. John) and Carl Henkel played on the FIVB tour. The top AVP team consisted of Kent Steffes and Karch Kiraly. Kiraly had led the US to indoor gold medals in 1984 and 1988, and was considered the greatest volleyball player in the world. Originally a beach partner of Sinjin Smith, he and Smith no longer got on well, further inflaming the rivalry.  The third US team consisted of Mike Dodd and Mike Whitmarsh, who also played on the AVP Tour. The match of the tournament occurred in the quarter-finals between Kiraly/Steffes and Smith/Henkel. Smith and Henkel went ahead 12-8, and had match point at both 14-13 and 15-14. Kiraly and Steffes fought off four match points to win, 17-15. The final came down to the two AVP teams, with Kiraly/Steffes defeating Dodd/Whitmarsh in two sets, 12-5, 12-8.

The final rounds of the tournaments were closely contested, as the Soviet Union only defeated Italy after overtime, and Brazil needed penalty shots to rid themselves of the West German team. The final, too went into overtime, when Savichev decided the match. It was the USSR’s second Olympic title (after 1956), and Brazil’s second consecutive final loss. Many of the medal winning players went on to have great professional careers. Three West Germans (Klinsmann, Häßler and Riedle) played for the West German team that won the World Cup in 1990, while four Brazilians (Taffarel, Jorginho, Romário and Bebeto would lift the same trophy in 1994.

But she left little doubt in this event, winning by an overwhelming margin with 99 targets hit to only 91 for second-placed Wei Ning of China. Rhode hit 74 of 75 targets in qualifying and then had a perfect 25 in the final round to win her third gold medal and fifth shooting medal in all. Her other golds came in double trap in 1996 and 2004. The bronze medal came down to a shoot-off between Slovakian Danka Barteková and Russian Marina Belikova with Barteková winning bronze on her fourth target.
Rhode set several Olympic records and bests with this gold medal. Her percentage of victory margin was the most dominant Olympic victory in an individual shooting event – with Rhode’s score being 108.8% of Wei’s. The next most dominant victory occurred in 2004 men’s double trap when Ahmed Al-Maktoum (UAE) defeated Rajyavardhan Rathore (IND), 189-179, a percentage victory margin of 105.6%.
Her five medals equals the most ever in Olympic shooting by a woman, set by Marina Dobrancheva-Logvinenko (RUS), Mariya Grozdeva (BUL), and Jasna Šekarić (YUG/SCG/SRB). Overall she is tied for second among Olympic shooting in terms of medals won, also tied with Germany’s Ralf Schumann, all trailing China’s Wang Yifu who has six. Rhode became the first woman to win three gold medals in Olympic shooting.
Rhode became the fifth person in any Olympic sport to win an individual medal at five consecutive Olympic Games or Winter Games, although she was only the second athlete to do so at the Summer Games, joining Japan’s judoka Ryoko Tamura-Tani, and Winter Olympians Armin Zöggeler (ITA-LUG), Georg Hackl (GER-LUG), and Claudia Pechstein (GER-SSK). Nobody has done this at six straight Olympics.
Finally, with this victory Rhode won gold medals over a gap of 16 years (1996-2012), a new Olympic best for women, and second all-time in all Olympic sports only to Belgium’s Hubert Van Innis, who won archery individual gold medals in 1900 and 1920.

Austrian Andreas Prommegger, who had dominated the event all season, was the fastest in qualifying, but was surprisingly defeated by American Chris Klug in the first elimination round, although Klug was later put out by Mathieu Bozzetto (FRA) in the quarter-finals when he crashed on his second run. Joining Bozzetto in the semi-finals were Benjamin Karl (AUT), Stanislav Detkov (RUS) and Canadian Jacey-Jay Anderson.
In the first of the semi finals, Karl won both his runs against Bozzetto fairly easily, his winning margin being 2.58 seconds. The second semi-final was much closer, with Anderson leading by 0.28 seconds after the first run. As Detkov tried to close the gap on the second run he fell halfway down the course, and eventually finished 1.72 seconds behind. This brought the final down to Karl against Andersson, the two pre-Games favorites. Anderson had won the 2009 World Championship and was second in the World Cup standings in 2009-10, trailing Karl, who had won the World Cup in 2007-08.
The contests for the medals were no less dramatic. In the bronze medal match, Bozzetto won the first run by 0.96 seconds from Detkov, both competitors making errors on the course. Unfortunately there was a problem with the sound at the starting gate for the second run, so the competitors didn’t hear the normal bleeps. Detkov mistimed his start and crashed into the gates before they had opened, effectively ending the contest. In the final, Karl built up a reasonable lead after Anderson had made a number of minor errors to take a 0.76 second lead into the second run. However, despite the same problems with the start gate that had affected the bronze medal contest, Anderson timed his start to perfection and started to reel back Karl. With the finishing line in sight, Anderson finally overtook Karl and finished 0.35 seconds ahead to take the gold medal.
Questions were raised about the necessity for the 5th-8th place contests. In one of the classification semi-finals, Rok Flander (SLO) did not start, meaning his opponent Simon Schoch (SUI) simply went through the starting gate and promptly stopped twice, just to register the win. It was little different in the contest for 7th / 8th place when, with Flander not starting, Chris Klug went through the gate and promptly stopped after his first run. To the cheers of the crowd Klug went down the course on his second run in a solo display.

Barring injury, the gold medal was conceded to him, with Canadian Damian Warner expected to win silver. In the end, Eaton won the gold medal he was supposed to win, and Warner won bronze, but Eaton’s victory was not that easy, as nobody was counting on France’s Kevin Mayer to have the meet of his life, with several personal bests.
Warner opened by winning the 100 metres in 10.30, with Eaton second in 10.46, but Eaton moved ahead after the long jump, with a mark of 7.94. The shot put leader was Mayer, who threw 15.76 to move into third, just behind Warner. Eaton won the 400 in 46.07 in what was probably his best event, while German Kai Kazmirek moved into second place after day one, with Warner in third place, and Mayer in fourth, despite running a PR 48.28.
Warner, the best decathlon hurdler, won the 110 hurdles to open day two, and move back into second, with Mayer third. Eaton seemed to seal the gold medal when he cleared his second height of 4.90 in the pole vault, but there was some drama, as he cleared only on his third attempt. Mayer set another PR of 5.40 in the vault to move into a solid second, well ahead of Warner, and creeping up on Eaton. When Mayer threw a near PR of 65.04 in round one of the javelin, and Eaton posted only 53.26, Mayer briefly moved into the lead, but Eaton recovered with 59.77 in the third round and led going into the 1,500, but only by 44 points. Mayer needed to outrun Eaton by 6.4 seconds in the 1,500, which was unlikely as Eaton was a superior runner, and it was not to be for the Frenchman, who held on for the silver, with Warner getting bronze.
Earlier in Rio, Eaton’s wife, Brianne Theisen-Eaton had entered the heptathlete as one of the favorites for gold, and certainly a medal. Had they both won gold, they would have been the first married couple to win individual gold medals at the same Olympics while competing for different countries, but Theisen-Eaton ended up with the bronze medal.

In Paris her closest rival from the 1928 Olympics, Fritzi Burger, earned another silver medal. The Viennese was second to Henie on six international championships occasions during her career, but to her comfort, she was European Champion in 1930 when Sonja Henie was absent.
Heavy favored Henie defended her Olympic title with ease – she was the unanimous choice of all the seven judges. Fritzi Burger had to be content with silver, with US skater Maribel Vinson as a close third, improving her fourth place from 1928. Vinson was US Champion 9 times between 1928 and 1937. She later married the Canadian skater Guy Owen and became one of the leading figure skating coaches in USA. In 1961 her eldest daughter Maribel Owen won the US Championships in pair skating, and her younger daughter Laurie Owen won the Ladies’ Singles. Since this was the first ever US Championships televised, the Owen family became national celebrities. But soon afterwards tragedy struck.

Moradi and Rybakov were eliminated in the snatch portion, failing to lift 166 kg and 175 kg respectively in three attempts, with Rybakov upping his weight to 180 kg in the final try. 175 kg alone would have been sufficient to take second place in the snatch, matching Apti Aukhadov’s lift, but ranking higher based on his lower bodyweight.

Tarek Yahia of Egypt, a 2010 world bronze medalist in the middleweight division, then matched the weight and positioned himself above the Cuban, before Aukhadov lifted the same weight and moved into first place. Lu, meanwhile, surprisingly failed three times in a row to lift the weight and was thus eliminated from the competition. Zieliński at first looked to be going the same way, failing at his initial attempt at 206 kg, but boosting himself into first place after a successful second lift. Rostami came out at 209 kg to tie Zieliński and Aukhadov in total lift and move into gold medal position by virtue of his lighter weight. Markov, now outside of the medals, was unable to respond and lost his chance of making the podium. Hernández also failed, at a weight of 210 kg, but Yehia and Aukhadov succeeded, bringing them into fourth and first places respectively. Zieliński followed with a successful lift of 211 kg, tying the Russian’s score and pushing into the gold medal spot with his lower body weight. Aukhadov attempted to respond with a 212 kg lift but failed, leaving him with nothing to do but wait and see if he would retain his silver medal after Rostami and Yahia’s final lifts. The Iranian went first, attempting 214 kg to tie Zieliński and Aukhadov (and win by body weight), but failed twice and remained in third place. Yehia tried to lift 216 kg, which would have given him not only the bronze medal, but the Olympic record as well, but was unable to do so, leaving him in fourth.
That was how the event and the results seemed to have ended. In 2015, however, the IOC began re-testing samples from the 2008 Beijing and 2012 London Olympics, using newer, more advanced testing techniques, in an effort to find those who had used performance enhancing drugs (PEDs), but in whom it could not be detected at the time of those Olympics. This was one of the many events affected.
In October 2016 Russian Apti Aukhadov, the original silver medalist, was disqualified for a positive re-test for turinabol (dehydrochloromethyltestosterone) and drostanolone, both anabolic steroids, losing his silver medal. Iranian Kianoush Rostami advanced to the silver medal position, while Egyptian Tarek Yahia received the bronze medal. Georgian lifter Raul Tsirek’idze, who originally finished ninth, was also disqualified, after a positive re-test for turinabol (dehydrochloromethyltestosterone) and stanozolol announced in November 2016.

Povetkin’s career had taken an unusual path on his way to the Olympic Games as he had already been a world champion in the professional ranks. He was allowed to compete in amateur boxing because his previous successes were in kickboxing which was considered a wholly different sport by the AIBA.
The Russian lived up to expectations by defeating Sydney Olympic finalist Mukhtarkhan Dildabekov and future Olympic champion Roberto Cammarelle to reach the final and then had the unexpected bonus of a walkover for the gold medal. His prospective opponent, the aptly named Egyptian Mohamed Aly, was forced to withdraw after suffering a fractured wrist in his upset victory over Michel López of Cuba in his semi-final.
Povetkin took a year long sabbatical from the ring before turning to the professional ranks and basing himself with the Sauerland Events promotion company in Germany. He held the WBA world title between 2011 and 2013  then was comprehensively beaten by Volodymyr Klychko in a unification match.

The match ended in a scoreless tie and went into overtime. At 0:46 of the overtime Zhabrailov attacked and Jackson countered, and the two wrestlers moved out of bounds and the action was re-started. The Unified coaches then protested that Zhabrailov had controlled Jackson and deserved a point, which would have ended the match, but Bulgarian referee Todor Grudev ruled that no point had been scored and this would later be upheld by FILA after a Unified Team protest. One minute later Jackson got Zhabrailov in a single-leg takedown, which earned him a point, the match, and the gold medal.
Zhabrailov was not happy. He sobbed after the loss and had to be forced to step up to the podium. Although he accepted his silver medal he did not put it around his neck. The American anthem, “The Star-Spangled Banner,” was played for Jackson, but nobody heard it because the Russian fans booed and whistled and drowned out the music.

He was lifted onto his horse with his arm tightly strapped but during the jumping ride Kurfürst reared back, throwing von Wangenheim who landed on his broken clavicle. He managed to re-mount the horse and finish the course so that Germany could win the gold medal.
Poland won the silver medal, with Great Britain taking bronze. The course difficulty is highlighted by Britain’s bronze-medal winning score which was over 8,000 points behind the silver medalists’ Polish score, although the British were over 9,000 points ahead of the fourth-placed Czechoslovak team. Britain won the bronze medal despite the fact that their final finisher, Richard Fanshawe, incurred numerous penalty points after having to chase his horse for 4 km before remounting, and he took 1 hour, 26 minutes to finish the course with an optimum time of 17:49. On the Czechoslovak team, Otomar Bureš similarly took 2 hours, 46 minutes to complete the course.

On the day prior to the event, he had reclaimed the Olympic title in the K-1 10000 that he had won in 1948 and then lost in 1952. One potentially strong challenger was Finland’s Thorvald Strömberg, the reigning Olympic runner-up and a man who had already performed the rare feat of besting Fredriksson in a race twice, by defeating him in the K-1 10000 at both the 1950 World Championships and the 1952 Summer Olympics. Other contenders included Louis Gantois of France, the 1952 Olympic bronze medalist and 1954 World runner-up, and Lajos Kiss, who was representing the reigning World bronze medalist nation of Hungary.
The opening round, however, brought several surprises. In the first heat, Fredriksson was nearly defeated by the Soviet Union’s Igor Pisarev and managed to eke out a victory by only 0.2 seconds, while Strömberg, suffering from stomach problems, was eliminated. In the next, both Kiss and Gantois were bested by a relatively unknown Stefan Kapłaniak of Poland, although, since every competitor in that heat advanced, it was likely that the others were merely conserving their strength. The final heat had no obvious favorites and was won by Germany’s Ernst Steinhauer, a World Champion in the K-2 500 and bronze medalist in the K-2 10000. In the final, Fredriksson took charge and defeated Pisarev with ease, earning his fifth gold medal and his third straight in the K-1 1000. The Soviet thus settled for silver, while Kiss took bronze a good distance ahead of Kapłaniak, who was fourth.

Halfway through the race, Kim kicked up the pace and took the lead. Ohno, meanwhile, remained in the back of the field for much of the race, emerging only with two laps to go. He first moved up to second place behind Kim. In the final lap, he then attempted to pass the South Korean on the inside. The two briefly touched, and Ohno waived his hands in the air signaling obstruction. Both continued to the finish line in full speed, the Korean seemingly taking the gold. But while Kim skated around with the Korean flag, it was announced that Kim was disqualified for cross-tracking, for obstructing Ohno who was trying to pass him. The call left Kim in disbelief on the ice, while Ohno ecstatically celebrated his victory with the crowd.
Disputed disqualifications are not uncommon in short track, and naturally one deciding the Olympic gold was hotly disputed. The referee’s decision fell badly with South Koreans, and Ohno and the IOC received thousands of e-mails and letters, some even containing death threats. Ohno was assigned body guards because of this, and still needs protection when competing in South Korea, where short track speed skating is a major sport. The impact of the decision was visible during the 2002 Football World Cup, held in South Korea and Japan. When Ahn Jung-Hwan scored the equaliser in a match between South Korea and the US, he celebrated his goal by making skating moves, later explaining the reference to Kim’s disqualification. Kim himself would bounce back in the best way possible. At the 2002 World Championships, after the Games, he won all four distances and the overall title - an unprecedented performance.

Both made the final comfortably as did American Matt Centrowitz, who had won silver at the 2013 World Championships, and bronze at the 2011 Worlds, also placing fourth at the London Olympics, but he was not expected to challenge for gold in Rio.
Centrowitz took the lead and set a historically dawdling pace, passing 400 metres in 66.9 and then slowing the pace even more, running 69.8 for the second lap, and passing 800 metres in 2:16.7. The question was who would start the kick, and when. The answer came at 600 metres when Centrowitz took off, running the next 200 metres in 27.4. He was briefly headed at 1,000 metres by Djiboutian Ayanleh Souleiman but he went wide on the far turn and Centrowitz re-took the lead. It was a lead he never relinquished, winning a stunning upset gold medal in 3:50.00. Centro ran a historic last 800 in 1:49.8, although his winning time was the slowest at the Olympics since Luigi Beccali won in 3:51.2 at the 1932 Games. Makhloufi came on fast for the silver medal, adding this to his silver medal from the 800 metres, with bronze going to New Zealand’s Nick Willis.

In her absence, the gold was conceded to Skoblikova, who had won the 1963 World Championships, and won all four distances on her way to the title. She had already won the 500 in Innsbruck.
In the second pair, Soviet skater Berta Kolokoltseva finished in 2:27.1 to take the lead. That would lead until the seventh pair when Finland’s Kaija Mustonen finished in 2:25.5. That was somewhat surprising as, prior to 1964, Mustonen had never made the podium at any distance in a major international tournament, although she had finished third in a pre-Olympic test 1,500 on 26 January, behind Skoblikova and Valentina Stenina. Skoblikova started in the 10th pair. She was equal to Kolokoltseva and Mustonen thru 700 metres, but was two seconds ahead at 1,100 metres, and won by almost three seconds, finishing in 2:22.6. This was Skoblikova’s fourth Olympic gold medal, after two in 1960 at Squaw Valley. Mustonen’s silver medal was unexpected but she would return the next day to win a bronze in the 1,000, and four years later, in Grenoble, she returned to win the gold medal in this event.

In the final round, Włodarczyk moved up to the silver medal with a mark of 77.60, and held that spot when Zhang fouled. After all the throwers had finished, an official found Heidler’s mark and it was re-measured at 77.12, good for the bronze medal.
That was how the event and the results seemed to have ended. In 2015, however, the IOC began re-testing samples from the 2008 Beijing and 2012 London Olympics, using newer, more advanced testing techniques, in an effort to find those who had used performance enhancing drugs (PEDs), but in whom it could not be detected at the time of those Olympics. This was one of the many events affected.
Tatyana Lysenko of Russia, who originally won the gold medal, was disqualified in October 2016 after a failed re-test which showed evidence of turinabol (dehydrochloromethyltestosterone) use. The original second, third, and fourth place finishers moved up one spot, with Anita Włodarczyk of Poland receiving the gold, Betty Heidler of Germany moving up to silver, and Zhang Wenxiu of China given the bronze.
There were also three other finalists disqualified in this event. Original seventh-place finisher Oksana Menkova of Belarus was disqualified in November 2016 for a re-test positive for turinabol (dehydrochloromethyltestosterone) and stanozolol. Mariya Bespalova of Russia, who placed 10th initially, was disqualified in March 2017 for a substance that was not announced. Finally, Russian Gulfiya Khanafeyeva lost her 15th-place finish in March 2017 for a re-test positive for turinabol (dehydrochloromethyltestosterone).

Of the two, Wotherspoon had had the best season prior to the Games. He had won four World Cup races, and a few weeks before the Olympics, had won the World Sprint Championships, taking the first of two 500 m races in the process. Shimizu, had a better historical record, though. Apart from being the defending Olympic champion, he had won the 500 m World title in 1996 and 1998 to 2001, and was world record holder. Several other skaters could claim realistic hopes for the title as well, notably Casey FitzRandolph, Mike Ireland and Gerard van Velde.
The biggest surprise early in the first run was the performance of Kip Carpenter, a former short-track speed skater, who recorded his first 34-second 500 m at 34.68. That time would eventually hold up as the third fastest of the day. The first skater to beat it was Shimizu (34.61), who seemed disappointed not to approach his own world record. In the next pair, it was FitzRandolph who completed the first 100 m in 9.44, and sped to a new personal best, 34.44. In the remaining pairs, none matched that time. The biggest story, however, was not FitzRandolph, but Wotherspoon. Skating in the last pair, his Olympic dreams were over after a few meters as he tripped and fell. On the second day, Wotherspoon showed off his great form by winning the second run, but that did not help him.
Although differences were not too large, the results of day one would still stand at the conclusion of the competition. The final race was run between FitzRandolph and Carpenter. The leader opened considerably slower than in the first run, and it seemed he might lose his 0.19 advantage on Shimizu. While beaten by his compatriot, FitzRandolph’s 34.81 was just enough to keep the Japanese skater at bay by 0.03 seconds. Carpenter, in turn, also lost a bit on the closest contender for bronze - Van Velde - but kept a 0.02-second edge on the Dutchman. Despite having been a known 500 m skater for several years, the Olympic 500 m was FitzRandolphs first international victory in the event. His father Jeff was also acting at the Olympics, appearing as the starter in several events, although not those in which his son competed.

Japan’s Sara Takanashi was considered the favorite, but after the first round she was only ranked third with a jump of 100.0 m. The surprise leader was German Carina Vogt with the longest jump of 103.0 m followed by France’s Coline Mattel. Even though she was second in the season’s World Cup standings, the 22-year-old German had never won a World Cup event, but nine podiums indicated her ability.
Going in reverse order, Austrian Daniela Iraschko-Stolz, who was fifth after the first round with a jump of 98.5 m, landed a wind-assisted jump of 104.5 m, the longest of the competition, taking the lead with just four jumpers remaining. The next jumper – Italian Evelyn Insam – failed to surpass her score as did Takanashi, who missed the podium. Her second jump of 98.5 m left her in fourth place, after 19 consecutive World Cup podiums prior to the Games and 10 wins in 13 events this season.
Mattel, ranked second after the first round, managed only 97.5 m, but her style points gave her a combined score of 245.2 points to win the bronze medal. Carina Vogt, jumping last, could only equal Mattel’s distance, but her combined score of 247.4 was just enough to win the gold medal and to become the first ever women’s Olympic champion in ski jumping. Although Vogt’s second jump was 7.0 m short of the Austrian’s, superior style marks, her telemark landing and wind compensation points gave her the victory, beating Iraschko-Stolz by 1.2 points, with bronze medalist Mattel only point further back.

Together they had won the World Title every year from 1973-78, and the Europeans in 1973-78 and 1980. In 1979, Rodnina took the year off to have a baby, and the World Championship was won that year by the American pair of Tai Babilonia and Randy Gardner. Babilonia/Gardner had been third at the Worlds in 1977-78 and became the first American pair to win the title since Karol and Peter Kennedy in 1950. The competition between the Soviet and American pairs was greatly anticipated, especially in Lake Placid at the height of the Cold War, but Rodnina and Zaitsev were still considered the favorites. Unfortunately the great dual did not occur. Before the Olympics, Randy Gardner injured himself in training. Just before the short program, he was given a lidocaine injection to his groin, hoping it would mask the pain enough for him to be able to skate. But during warm-ups, he fell several times, and it was not felt he could safely continue. Babilonia and Gardner withdrew without competing and Rodnina/Zaitsev were left with no real competition. They won the gold medal easily, winning both the short program and the free skate, and being ranked first by all nine judges. For Rodnina, it was her third consecutive gold medal, having won in 1972 with Aleksey Ulanov, making her only the second figure skater to win three consecutive gold medals, after Sonja Henie. Set to compete at the 1980 Worlds, she withdrew with a shoulder injury and thus retired after Lake Placid, having won three Olympic gold medals and 10 World Championships.

Although she seemed to have no serious challengers for the title, one of the most interesting competitors in the event was Oksana Chusovitina of Germany who was participating in her sixth Olympics, a record for a gymnast, having earned team all-around gold with the Unified Team in 1992 and silver in the horse vault in 2008 (Yordan Yovchev of Bulgaria would also compete in his sixth Olympics and tie this record the following day). She had competed for her native Uzbekistan from 1993 through 2006 and would do so again beginning in 2013 in a move that would lead her to qualify for the 2016 Summer Olympics and appear in her seventh Games as the oldest ever Olympic gymnast. She had moved to Germany originally to receive medical treatment for her son’s acute lymphocytic leukemia, and later received citizenship, competing for that nation in the interim. She also held one World Championships title in the event, from 2003, and had been runner-up in 1991, 2001, 2005, and 2011.
Maroney’s skill was on full display in the qualifications, winning them by a margin of nearly half a point ahead of Sandra Izbaşa of Romania, an Olympic gold medalist from 2008 in the floor exercise. She continued dominating with her first vault, setting an unsurpassed score of 15.866, again nearly half a point ahead of her nearest competitor, Mariya Paseka of Russia. For the second vault, however, Maroney fell on the landing and received a 14.300, well below nearly all the other competitors. Her first vault was outstanding enough to give her an average score of 15.083, 0.033 points ahead of Paseka, with Izbaşa still to come. The Romanian’s first vault came in at 15.383, below Maroney and Paseka’s, but she scored high in the second with 15.000, giving her an average of 15.191 that was sufficient to crown her as the champion. Maroney, who had been expected to take the gold, settled for silver while Pasenka nabbed the bronze. Maroney’s unsporting reaction to her silver medal was criticized by media outlets and a picture of her appearing disappointed on the podium became an internet meme that was so widespread that it was mimicked by American President Barack Obama when the two met at a White House function for Olympians. Yamilet Peña, the first Olympic gymnast from the Dominican Republic and the 2012 Pan American Champion, finished a respectable sixth in the finals.

Tushishvili toppled all his previous opponents by Ippon (full point), and, like Krpálek, required the Golden Score just once, against 2012 and 2016 bronze medallist Rafael Silva in the quarter-final. Third seed Tamerlan Bashayev, Tushishvili’s opponent in the semi-final, won his fight for bronze. Bashayev ousted the favourite, French giant Riner, in the quarter-final. The outcome of this fight was still considered a surprise, regardless of the ranking list, and Bashayev’s silver at the 2021 World Championships.
Riner, however, bronze medallist in 2008 at the age of 19 and gold medallist in 2012 and 2016, secured a bronze medal in the repêchage when Harasawa was disqualified for non-combativity after receiving his third Shido.

Reigning World Champion Verheijen had not made the Dutch team, however, but with Jochem Uytdehaage, winner of the Olympic 5,000 m, he had a decent replacement. The best non-Dutch prospect was Frank Dittrich. The German had been bronze medallist at the World Championships 1998-2000 and had won the only World Cup competition at the distance earlier that season, when none of the Dutch skaters even made the podium.
Defending champion Romme had only narrowly qualified at the Dutch trials, suffering from illness at the time. The first of the favorites to skate in Salt Lake City, he set out to break his world record of 13:03.40, which he had set in late 2000. Still not in his 1998 form, he set out fast, as usual, but faded sooner than expected. His 13:10.03 was still one of the fastest ever 10,000 m recorded. Having won two Olympic medals already, much was expected from Jochem Uytdehaage. The Dutchman set out for a very tight schedule, recording lap times between 30.64 and 31.48. Not only did this result in a new world record, his time of 12:58.92 also made him the first man to beat 13 minutes in the 10,000 m.
With these results, the first two places seemed secure, and the bronze was to be decided in the very last pair. Frank Dittrich, known for his fast final laps, was paired with Lasse Sætre of Norway, known for his ability to )die and resurrect) during a race. The two remained close at first, with Sætre pulling away around the half-way point. While the German’s final sprint did not come, Sætre skated to a new personal best and a bronze medal.

But the Hungarians, who became wildly popular with the Lake Placid audience, won the free dance. The battle for the gold was the closest in Olympic ice dance history. Four judges ranked the Soviets first, four ranked the Hungarians first, with the British judge having them tied. This brought it down to the tie-breaker of total ordinals, which the Soviets won, 13-14, giving them the gold medal. The actual deciding vote was cast by the Soviet judge, to nobody’s surprise, who ranked Regőczy and Sallay only third. Wallechinsky has noted, “The announcement of the results was greeted by catcalls and boos from the American audience, which preferred the lively, upbeat style of Regőczy and Sallay to the staid, traditional image of Linichuk and Karponosov.” Regőczy and Sallay would return in a few weeks to win the 1980 World Championships.

The endurance phase at Fairbanks Ranch had the following sections\: roads and tracks – 4,180 metres, 19 minutes; steeplechase – 3,105 metres, 4½ minutes, with 9 obstacles; roads and tracks – 11,779 metres, 53½ minutes; and cross-country – 7,410 metres, 13 minutes, with 33 obstacles. There was a rest day after the endurance competition to transport the horses back to Santa Anita for the jumping.
Britain’s Lucinda Green was a slight favorite, having won at Badminton in 1983-84 and at Burghley in 1981. She finished only 22nd in the opening dressage, however, which left her far behind the other contenders, and she never caught up, eventually finishing sixth. Among the other favorites, Americans Bruce Davidson was second in dressage and Karen Stives was third, both trailing Swiss rider Hansüli Schmutz. Both Davidson and Schmutz dropped well back on the endurance course, with Green, Stives, New Zealand’s Mark Todd, and Italy’s Marina Sciocchetti recording perfect scores on the cross-country course, as Stives took the lead over Todd going into the jumping. Todd went early in the jumping and had a clean ride, to give him 51.6 total penalty points, all from dressage. Stives was the last rider off and was clean through 10 obstacles, but then she and Charisma nicked the next-to-last obstacle and the 5 faults cost her the gold medal, which went to Todd. Britain’s Virginia Holgate had been third after the endurance contest and her perfect jumping round kept her there for the bronze medal. Stives and Holgate were the first women to win medals in Olympic individual eventing.

The top 7 nations of the 2011 World Championships all qualified for the Games. There was one nation standing out, however: France. As the reigning Olympic champions, they had also claimed the 2009 and 2011 world titles. The only blemish on their record was the 2012 European Championships, where they finished only 10th (after winning the 2010 edition). That title had gone to Denmark, which had also been runner-up at the World Championships, and could thus be seen as the chief challenger of the French.
The pool matches provided little surprises, but the quarter-finals were all closely fought. Hungary beat 2008 silver medallists Iceland 34-33 after two extra time periods, while France beat Spain despite a three-goal deficit at half-time. Croatia had also been behind against Tunisia but prevailed, as did Sweden, which ousted neighbours Denmark. As in 2008, France and Croatia met in the semi-finals, and as then, the French won, bringing them very close to becoming the first ever team to retain an Olympic handball title. Sweden earned a one-goal win over Hungary for their nation’s fourth Olympic final berth, having lost the previous three. The two finalists had also played each other in the group phase, France winning 29-26 over the Scandinavians.
Cheered on by a large contingent of French supporters, the defending champions set down a strong defense, with a leading role for goalie Thierry Omeyer. At the break, the score was only 10-8, and the match remained tight throughout the second half. The closing stages were exciting. With just a minute on the clock, Niclas Ekberg brought Sweden back within one goal of the French. Luc Abalo responded quickly with a powerful shot to make it 22-20. That goal proved decisive, despite Sweden making it 22-21 with just 23 seconds on the clock.
In October 2012, it became known that several French handball players were investigated in a match-fixing scandal in the French competition. Among those questioned as part of the investigation were Nikola Karabatic, France’s handball star and Samuel Honrubia, both on the gold medal team.

The pre-Olympic favorites were both British - George Larner who had won both walks at the 1908 Olympics, and had won the AAA 7-mile walk in 1911, and Ernie Webb who had won the AAA 7-mile walk in 1908-1910, and was the silver medalist in both walks at the 1908 Olympics.  The world best in 1912 was 45:43.5 set by Paul Gunia (GER) in Berlin on 24 October 1908.  For unknown reasons, neither Larner nor Gunia competed and in their absence, Webb was expected to win easily.
But Webb could not match Canada’s George Goulding, who had also competed at the 1908 Olympics.  At London, Goulding had placed 4th in the 3,500 metre walk, did not finish in his heat of the 10 mile walk, and also ran the marathon, finishing 22nd.  However, since 1908, Goulding had greatly improved and had beaten Webb at match races in Toronto in the summer of 1910.  After winning the gold medal, Goulding’s first act was to send a telegram to his wife.  It read only, “Won - George.”
But Goulding spoke more of the final, as given in Henry Roxborough’s Canada at the Olympics, “In the final, I took the lead right from the start.  When I was about 40 yards ahead of Webb, I thought the judges were after me.  One of them said something in Swedish which I didn’t understand; but when I turned toward him I saw a broad grin on his face and concluded he must have said something nice.  Still, it was a ticklish moment, for the judges had the right to pull anyone off the track without previous warnings.  With other judges, I could have improved my time; but during the last mile, when I had a lead of about 75 yards, I slowed considerably and took no chance of being disqualified.  Besides, in the first heat, I had rubbed the skin off my toes, while wearing almost new shoes; and in the final my feet were really torturing.  However, in winning, I soon forgot the pain and remembered only the pleasure.”

The ongoing Super G World Cup saw only two different winners in the five races held, with Marco Odermatt winning the season opener in Beaver Creek 1 and the last race before the Olympics, in Wengen. In-between, Aleksander Aamodt Kilde won in Beaver Creek 2, Val Gardena, and Bormio. Both also topped the standings with Kilde first and Odermatt second, followed by the Austrians Matthias Mayer, Vincent Kriechmayr, and Raphael Haaser. Kriechmayr was also Super G Crystal Globe winner in 2021, after finishing second on three consecutive occasions in the previous years, and was also the reigning 2021 World Champion. Dominik Paris won the 2019 Super G World Cup and became World champion the same year, while Kjetil Jansrud won the World Cup trophy in 2018, and Mauro Caviezel in 2020.
Jansrud competed in the Super G, after not taking part in the downhill the day before, but was not at his best after the injury caused by a fall in early December 2021. Caviezel did not participate in Beijing because he was still recovering from concussion sustained in a bad crash in a training run at Garmisch-Partenkirchen in January 2021.
Kilde, wearing bib number 7, was the first of the favourites to go and he overtook Pinturault, who had been leading up to that point by a full second. Wearing bib number 9 was Odermatt, who was seen as Kilde’s toughest opponent, but he was not able to finish the race and so another Norwegian, Sejersted, settled into second place. Next to race was Kriechmayr, but he only finished in third, 2/100ths of a second behind Sejersted. Wearing bib number 13, Mayer again gave a great Olympic performance and took the lead 0.42 seconds ahead of Kilde. What looked a comfortable lead turned into a nail-biter when the next starter Ryan Cochran-Siegle finished second, only 4/100ths behind the leader. As none of the other competitors were able to come close to a podium finish, the medallists were decided and Mayer repeated his win from four years ago in this event.
Mayer become only the third male skier to win an Alpine skiing event back-to-back after Alberto Tomba (giant slalom 1988 and 1992) and Kjetil André Aamodt (also in Super G 2002 and 2006). Mayer become the fifth male Alpine skier to win three gold medals and also became to most successful Austrian Alpine skier ever. Mayer won the race with an average speed of 102.09 km/h and 1.13 metres ahead of Cochran-Siegle. Like in the downhill, manufacturer Head again won gold, and also silver, but bronze went to Atomic with Kilde. Cochran-Siegle who followed in the footsteps of his mother Barbara Cochran, the slalom gold medal winner back in 1972.

During the race, the difference between the contenders and the also-rans quickly became clear, though. Germany (Paul Wevers and Ludwig Landen) and Austria (Viktor Kalisch and Karl Steinhuber) soon distanced themselves from the rest of the field. Austria attempted to take the lead at the halfway point, but Germany managed to hold them off. The Austrians then had given their all, and had to let the German boat go, trailing by 20 seconds at the finish line.

The final turned into a carbon copy of the 400 metres medley that had taken place three days earlier with Australia’s Steph Rice and Kirsty Coventry of Zimbabwe vying to be Olympic champion. Like the 400 Coventry opened up a lead but was pegged back and overtaken by Rice in the closing stages. This was the second of Rice’s three Olympic gold medals and the third silver medal won by Coventry in Beijing. Natalie Coughlin, who had made a last minute to race this event at the US trials, finished ahead of Hoff for the bronze medal.

These three had occupied the podium places at all four international races held thusfar. At the first World Cup, Johann Olav Koss was the winner. But the Norwegian world record holder had suffered an inflamed pancreas just days before the Olympic 5,000 m. While he had recovered, his form was unknown. Koss’s compatriot Geir Karlstad had won the other two World Cup races in the season. Karlstad was looking for revenge for the 1988 Olympics, where he had performed disappointingly with a seventh place (and a fall in the 10,000 m). The third contender was Bart Veldkamp of the Netherlands, who won the 5,000 m at the European Championships.
Due to rainfall, it was expected the race would be postponed like earlier Olympic races in Albertville. This time, the referees decided to start as planned. That meant the first pairs were skated on very soft ice, hampering the early starters. This mostly hit Koss, who recorded 7:11.32 (seventh) and Veldkamp, who finished in 7:08.00 (fifth). After the first ice preparation, conditions became better. Young Dutchman Falko Zandstra took advantage of this, skating 7:02.28, beating his compatriot Leo Visser, the Olympic runner-up of 1988. But his time was no match for Geir Karlstad. The established long distance skater set off faster than Zandstra, and never looked back. His 6:59.97 was good enough to become the first Norwegian to win Olympic speed skating gold since 1976.
Prior to the Games, newspapers had revealed that Karlstad carried around a letter from Norwegian doctors, stating his body produced high levels of testosterone, close to the maximum allowed epi-testosterone - testosterone ratio of 1:6. Karlstad supposedly handed out this letter at doping controls, but various officials from the IOC and ISU attested that such a letter would not absolve Karlstad in case of an infringement. This was naturally brought up again after Karlstad’s win, but he passed doping tests without exceeding any limits, as he had done on all previous occasions.

Hoppe did in fact lead after the first run but his hopes of retaining the title were ruined in the controversial second run. Seeding of the top fifteen crews had not yet been introduced at the Olympics and by the time East Germany I competed the track was in less than perfect condition. Some of the top crews, including the GDR and the half way leaders from the Soviet Union filed a protest and asked for the results of the first day to be set aside. Their arguments centered on the fact that strong winds had blown dust and dirt onto the track and had left the track in a condition which was unfair to later runners. Hoppe had a strong case to say that the time he lost on the difficult second run had a material effect on the result as he dropped a second and a quarter on that run to the Soviet gold medallists. The Soviets won the title only by three quarters of a second. Hoppe was also critical of the novice crews that littered the event and complained that the damage to the track caused by inexperienced drivers had also had an effect on the performance of other teams.
The winner of the Soviet Union’s one and only Olympic bobsleigh title, Jānis Ķipurs, was a Latvian whose bob was painted in Latvian national colours. Four years later he would carry the Latvian flag in the opening ceremony in Albertville.

But by 1988 he was far from the swimmer he had once been. He had placed fourth in this event at the 1986 Worlds, won by West Germany’s Rainer Henkel, and had not qualified for the final of the 1987 Europeans. The Soviet swim coaches did not choose him for the 1988 Olympic team, but the Soviet Minister of Sport intervened and Salnikov was placed on the team, and he pushed his training in an attempt to regain his old form.
In the final Salnikov swam behind American Matt Cetlinski for the first 600 metres, pulling slightly ahead at 700. West German Stefan Pfeiffer moved into second at 950 metres, as Salnikov continued to increase his lead, and Cetlinski dropped back to third. Just before 1,400 m the 400 gold medalist, Uwe Daßler of the GDR, caught Cetlinski. Salnikov continued to power ahead until the final 100, when Pfeiffer closed slightly. But it was not enough as Salnikov won his second gold medal in the event, with Pfeiffer second, and Daßler third. For Cetlinski, it was further disappointment as he placed fourth, as he had in the 400.

They claimed that the French officials told them that if a field event ended on Sunday any competitors not wishing to compete would have a chance to post their marks the following day. This was apparently ruled at a meeting on Wednesday, 11 July. On Saturday night, however, the French ruled that the results of all Sunday events would be final, with no recourse to any athletes who did not compete due to Sabbatarian objections. Apparently the Americans were not told of this decision.
The top American vaulters were Charles Dvorak, Daniel Horton, and Bascom Johnson. They were not at the field on Sunday when the pole vault started. Fortunately for the American team, Irv Baxter, who had just won the high jump (which started at 1545), and Meredith Colket, were present and were able to compete in the vault. They took the first two places without much difficulty, but the American team was not happy.
Therefore on Monday morning, 16 July, the French officials held a special pole vault competition which they considered outside of the Olympic events and which was won by Bascom Johnson, clearing 3.38 metres. The Americans continued to protest, however, and after the handicap pole vault was held on 19 July, won by Hungarian Jakab Kauser, the organizers conducted another special pole vault competition later in the day – this event – which was won by Daniel Horton, with 3.45 metres, with Charles Dvorak (3.35 m) second. The original pole vault competition continues to be considered as the Olympic event.
