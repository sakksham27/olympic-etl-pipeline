He should have been the favorite in 1964, but was injured and did not compete at Tokyo, and in his absence the class was wide open. There were six wrestlers left after four rounds, with all but Yugoslav Branislav Simić, the 1962 World runner-up, eliminated in round five, which gave him the gold medal. Jiří Kormaník of Czechoslovakia and Lothar Metz of Germany were the next best placed, with 6 bad points, and they fought off for the other medals, with Kormaník winning by decision to take the silver and Metz receiving the bronze. Metz would return in 1968 to win the gold medal while Simić won a bronze medal in Mexico City at his third Olympics.

38568,"Water Polo, Men",1976 Summer Olympics,19,Water Polo,/editions/19/sports/WPO,18 – 27 July 1976,"Piscine olympique, Montréal, Québec / Centre Claude-Robillard, Montréal, Québec",131 from 12 countries,Round-robin pools advanced teams to the round-robin final pool.,na,"Since World War II the top water polo nations had been Hungary, Yugoslavia, Italy, and the Soviet Union. In 1973 FINA instituted the World Aquatics Championship, which gave more idea of who the strongest teams were coming into the Olympic year. But those only showed that little had changed in the water polo world. In 1973 Hungary was World Champion, with the Soviets winning silver, and Yugoslavia bronze, while in 1975 the Soviets won the title, followed by Hungary and Italy. At the 1974 European Championships, the medalists finished in the same order as in 1973 at the Worlds – Hungary, USSR, Yugoslavia.
But in a shocker at Montréal, the Soviet Union did not advance to the medal round, placing only third in Group B, trailing the Netherlands and Romania. The Soviet officials were so upset that they withdrew their team from the consolation pool, forfeiting the first match against Cuba, officially stating that several of their players were sick, but the Olympic water polo officials then convinced them to play on. They did but placed second behind Cuba in the consolations, or eighth overall, the forfeited loss to Cuba being the margin between the two teams.
In Group A Italy and Yugoslavia advanced, while Hungary and West Germany made it out of Group C. The final pool saw Hungary win its sixth Olympic water polo gold medal (1932, 1936, 1952, 1956, 1964, 1976). They won their first four matches in the finals, although every game was close, as they won by scores of 6-5, 5-3, 5-3, 9-8, and then faced their archrival, Yugoslavia, who had not won a game in the final round. The two teams tied, 5-5, which gave Hungary the gold and placed Yugoslavia fifth, without a final round victory. Italy and the Netherlands tied the final match of the tournament, 3-3, which left them tied in the pool, with 2 wins, 2 ties, and 1 loss each. They were also tied on goal differential, but Italy was awarded the silver medal because they had scored more goals in the medal round, 22-18.
Hungary also had the leading goalscorer of the tournament, with Tamás Faragó, who scored 22 times. István Szivós, Jr. was also on the Hungarian team, winning his third consecutive Olympic medal, after bronze in 1968 and silver in 1972. He would return in 1980 and win a fourth medal, a bronze.

Schröter, however, had failed to uphold East Germany’s dominance at the Worlds and managed only silver in 1979, losing the crown to Sanda Toma of Romania. It was unclear, however, if Toma would be able to repeat this feat in Moscow, and thus both competitors were considered favorites at the 1980 Summer Olympics. If nothing else, it could at least be said that neither would go unchallenged: other World Championship medalists attending the Games were Mariann Ambrus of Hungary (silver in 1975, bronze in 1978 and 1979) and Hette Borrias of the Netherlands (bronze in 1979).
In the opening round, Toma was the slowest heat winner, despite having to contend with Schröter and Borrias in her heat, the latter of whom was the only competitor not to qualify for the semi-finals. The fastest time in the heats went to Rositsa Spasova of Bulgaria, who had been fourth at the 1976 Games, while Beryl Mitchell of Great Britain took her heat despite the presence of Ambrus. Toma and Schröter won their semi-final heats with times only 0.34 seconds apart, which seemed to promise an exciting final. In the end, however, it was the then relatively unknown Soviet entry, Antonina Makhina, with whom Toma had to contend. The Romanian staved off the Soviet challenge, however, and captured gold, while Makhina came in second for silver. Schröter, meanwhile, took bronze, while Spasova finished just off the Olympic podium for the second time. Toma’s victory was the first Olympic rowing gold medal for Romania since the nation made its début in the sport in 1952.

Sipilä seemed to have things well in hand, winning Group B easily, but he then met Yugoslav Vlado Lisjak in the final match, Lisjak throwing Sipilä in only 57 seconds to win a big upset gold medal. Lisjak had no international record and was only a last-minute substitute on the Yugoslavian team. Sipilä also won World silver medals in 1981 and 1986, and European bronze medals in 1980-81 and 1983. The bronze medal match came down to favored Romanian Ştefan Negrişan, the 1982 and 1984 European silver medalist, against American Jim Martinez, but Martinez prevailed, pinning Negrişan in only 25 seconds.

She then won the 1991 World Championships on platform. She was so young that the diving authorities changed the rules requiring divers to be 14-years-old during the Olympic year in order to compete. She made that, turning 14-years-old only 20 days after the Olympic platform final. Fu was unchallenged in Barcelona, winning both the qualifying and final rounds by huge margins. She was helped by her optional dives, all of which had a degree of difficulty of 3.0 or higher, with two at 3.2 and one at 3.3. She clinched the title on her penultimate dive, a back 3½ tuck (3.3), scoring 8s and 8.5s to move well ahead of her teammate, Zhu Jinhong. But on the final dive, Zhu missed badly on an inward 3½ tuck, dropping out of the medals, which went to Yelena Miroshina (EUN-silver) and Mary Ellen Clark (USA-bronze).
Clark was the second-oldest competitor in the event and was second after six dives, but then blew an inward 3½ tuck. She would return in 1996 to repeat her bronze medal performance, overcoming difficulty with vertigo. Fu would return to Atlanta and win both diving events, adding a fourth gold medal in the 2000 springboard, and a silver in synchronized springboard. She would also repeat as World Champion on the platform in 1994.
Silver medalist Miroshina never competed internationally after Barcelona. On 18 December 1995 she died after a fall out of her ninth-floor apartment in Moscow, at only 21-years-old. The details are murky, as it is uncertain if this was a suicide or she fell or was pushed.

He also competed at the Olympics in 1928 and 1936, winning a bronze medal in this event in 1928 and a silver on the rings in 1936. At the age of 97, Štukelj was honored at the Opening Ceremony of the 1996 Atlanta Olympics. He had proudly been able to watch Slovenia first compete as an independent nation at Barcelona in 1992.

All three Americans matched or bettered the world record in the heats and although the semi-finals saw the field edge up on them slightly, there was little doubt as to who would fill the medal positions. Mariechen Wehselau opened a lead on her compatriots at the half way mark but Ethel Lackie, at seventeen marginally the youngest of the USA’s teenage trio, put on a finishing burst that took her to the wall just ahead of Wehselau with Gertrude Ederle back in third. Ederle remains to this day the youngest swimmer to set a world record which she did at the age of 12 years 298 days and was also the first woman to swim the English Channel.

The final apparatus score made up of 50% of the all-around total and a final optional program. Soviet Nikolay Andrianov was the defending champion, but the 1978-79 World Champion had been American Kurt Thomas, who could not compete because of the USA-led boycott. In 1979 Thomas had shared the World title with East German Roland Brückner, who took the gold medal in Moskva, followed by Andrianov and his teammate Aleksandr Dityatin. The floor exercise always ends the apparatus finals, and with his bronze medal, Dityatin became the first Olympic athlete to win eight medals at one Olympic Games, as he won three gold, four silver, and one bronze.

He was a three-time World Champion, defending Olympic Champion, and by 1992 had set the last 16 world records in pole vaulting. On 5 August 1991 one of his world records was AT 6.10 (20-0¼), which meant little to most people, but to the Imperial world, that was the first pole vault ever over clear 20 feet. He qualified easily, and opened in the final with 5.70 (18-8¼). Missing twice at that height he then passed to 5.75, where he also failed and he was out of the competition without a height. What had happened?
One theory relates to the time allowed competitors in the pole vault, which is two minutes after being called for the next jump. As the star of the international circuit, Bubka was usually allowed to do what he wanted. But American Tim Bright had reminded the officials in Barcelona of the rules and Bubka later commented that it seemed like the clock was running faster than usual. In his absence the competition came down to two Russians, representing the Unified Team. Maksim Tarasov and Igor Trandenkov were the only vaulters over 5.80 (19-0¼), which decided the competition. Tarasov’s first attempt clearance got him the gold medal, with silver to Trandenkov. Spaniard Javier García won the bronze medal to the delight of the Barcelona fans, with his second attempt clearance at 5.75 (18-10¼). America’s Kory Tarpenning also made 5.75 (18-10¼), but on his third effort, and had to compete despite being booed by the partisan Spanish fans.

American Regan Smith had set it first with 57.57 in opening the 2019 World Championship medley relay, while Australia’s Kaylee McKeown had three times gone under 58 seconds, most recently setting a world record at the Australian Olympic Trials with 57.45. Canadian Kylie Masse had swum 57.70 at the recent Canadian Olympic Trials, making her the third swimmer to crack the 58-second barrier, but she had also held the world mark back in 2017, swimming 58.10. Another swimmer to watch was the venerable Australian Emily Seebohm, the 2017 World Champion and the silver medallist at London in 2012.
All the favorites comfortably made it through the preliminaries and the semi-finals, including American challenger Rhyan White and Britain’s Kathleen Dawson. The favorites in the final were probably Smith and McKeown but it was very close. Masse led the first lap of the final in 27.91 with White second and McKeown third, but it was Kaylee McKeown who finished fastest to win the gold medal, coming in with ¼-second margin over Masse, as Smith also closed quickly for the bronze medal.
Four days later, McKeown would come back and complete the backstroke double, with Masse repeating her silver medal. McKeown would eventually win four medals, and three golds, in Tokyo with gold in the women’s medley relay and a bronze in the mixed medley relay.

The Olympic mark was set by Tim Ahearne in London in 1908.  His brother, Dan Ahearn, finished 6th in Antwerp but had set the world record at a meet in New York on 30 May 1911.  Both Irish emigrants, the family name was Ahearne but Dan changed the spelling after arriving in the United States.
Dan Ahearn was lucky to be able to compete at all in the event.  The American team was less than pleased with their accommodations in Antwerp, which were in an old school building.  The team members protested to their officials, to no avail.  The athletes had a 10 PM curfew, but one night, Ahearn did not return at all, having rented a room for himself in a tavern, in protest against his sleeping quarters.  For this he was removed from the Olympic team.  In response, the 200 members of the U.S. Olympic team signed a petition demanding better accomodations and that Ahearn be reinstated, threatening to withdraw en masse if their demands were not met.  Eventually Ahearn was returned to the Olympic team and was thus able to compete.

It was not certain if The Herminator could recover in time for the Super G, but he appeared at the starthouse, with the lead held at the time by his teammate, Hans Knauß. Maier skied somewhat conservatively for him, as he was known for his wild, go-for-broke style, probably affected by his serious downhill accident. Still, he bested Knauß’s time by 0.61 seconds, taking the lead, and nobody would challenge that time, bringing Maier the gold medal he most wanted. As the 17th starter, after the seeded skiers had gone off, Switzerland’s Didier Cuche came down in the same time as Knauß and they shared silver medals. Three days later, Maier would add a second gold medal in the giant slalom.

The only other skier to perform exceptionally was three-time Olympian Jesper Tjäder of Sweden, whose jump of 85.35 would be good enough for bronze. In the second run, however, he was outperformed by Goepper, who captured the silver medal, while Ragettli had a best jump that was only good enough for fourth. No one else received above 80 points, with Ruud finishing fifth and Bösch sixth.

Start Altitude : 1,712 m Vertical Drop  : 211 m   ","The women’s slalom was the second female Alpine skiing event in Beijing. There were two clear favourites for this event with Petra Vlhová and Mikaela Shiffrin. They had won all seven slaloms held in the ongoing World Cup season, with Vlhová winning in Levi (twice), Lienz, Zagreb, and Kranjska Gora, while Shiffrin triumphed in Killington and Schladming. Vlhová also topped the standings with Shiffrin second, followed by Wendy Holdener, Lena Dürr, and Katharina Liensberger.
Since the last Olympics in 2018, Shiffrin had won the Crystal Globe in 2018 and 2019, Vlhová in 2020, and Liensberger in 2021, with the world titles going to Shiffrin in 2019 and Liensberger in 2021. A question mark was left as to who would take gold after Vlhová only finished 14th, and Shiffrin did not finish in the first technical event in Beijing two days earlier, when neither had been at their best. Interestingly, their coaches had been chosen to set the courses with Mike Day in the first run and Mauro Pini in the second run.
The race was opened by bib number 1 Dürr, and it turned out that her performance would be the best on the first run with Gisin only 3/100ths of a second behind. Surprisingly placed third after the first run was giant slalom gold medallist Sara Hector, only 0.11 seconds behind the lead. In fourth was another surprise with Andreja Slokar, followed by Holdener in fifth, with Liensberger and Vlhová in seventh and eighth respectively, both already more than 6/10ths behind Dürr. It was even worse for Shiffrin, as the course setting of her coach was no help and she went out after only about five seconds racing.
In the second run, Vlhová took advantage of the course setting of her coach and stormed with the best run time to take the gold medal. Liensberger going down just after Vlhová set the second-best time to win silver as none of the others from the best six after run one were able to catch them. Holdener took bronze 0.12 behind Vlhová and 0.04 behind Liensberger, but finished 0.07 ahead of midway leader Dürr. As fifth placed Slokar was also only 0.22 behind Vlhová, this was the closest women’s Olympic slalom ever.
This was the first ever medal for Slovakia in an Alpine skiing event. With Vlhová and Liensberger, the manufacturer Rossignol won two medals, while Holdener won bronze for Head, allowing this brand to win a medal in each of the first four races in Beijing. A record number of 51 nations participated in this event, which was the highest number of different countries to do so in a female Olympic Alpine skiing event ever. Finishing 50th and last was Lee Wen-Yi, who became the first ever Olympic Alpine skier for Chinese Taipei.

The qualifying was to consist of the top 10 finishers from the 1962 World Championships, but Poland and Yugoslavia declined and China was not an IOC member at the time. The top three places from the B World Championships were offered a spot in the tournament, which were 1) GDR, 2) Netherlands, and 3) Korea. Because of the problems with the mixed German team, the GDR did not compete and the spot was offered to the United States.
The favorites were the Soviet Union, which had won four of the five World Championships, including 1960 and 1962. But Czechoslovakia had been runners-up at the 1960/62 Worlds, and was European Champions in 1955 and 1958. In the end these two teams finished 1-2, essentially tying with 8-1 records. The USSR lost to Japan, but defeated Czechoslovakia. The gold medal was decided on the basis of point margin ratio. The Soviets scored 415 points and yielded 279, a ratio of 1.487, while Czechoslovakia score 486 points and gave up 399, a ratio of 1.218. Japan won the bronze medal, despite never having made the podium at the Worlds. They had finished fifth at the 1962 World Championships.

His supremacy was not unchallenged, however, and he would meet stiff competition with the likes of Dato Marsagishvili of Georgia, the reigning European Champion, and Ehsan Naser Lashgari of Iran, reigning and three-time Asian Champion. Şərifov and Lashgari were drawn in the same half and met in the semi-finals, where the Azerbaijani managed to edge out the Iranian in three rounds for a chance at the gold. In a comparatively weaker top bracket, Marsagishvili was thought to be a cinch to survive to the finals, but was defeated in the quarterfinals by Jaime Espinal of Puerto Rico. Espinal was the most recent Central American and Caribbean Games Champion and won one round against each of his opponents by at least six points in his successful journey to the gold medal match. In the final, however, Şərifov was unquestionably the dominant wrestler, winning the rounds 6-1 and 2-0 to give Azerbaijan its second gold medal of the competition – and the day – following Toğrul Əsgərov’s victory in the lightweight division.
In the first bronze medal bout, Marsagishvili faced rookie Soslan Gattsiyev of Belarus and was heavily favored to win. The Georgian asserted his dominance with a quick takedown in the first 10 seconds of the starting period that he was able to convert into a total of three points to capture the round. He was victorious in the second period by only a slightly less margin, 3-1, and easily won the bronze. For the final podium spot, Lashgari battled İbrahim Bölükbaşı of Turkey, the 2010 Mediterranean Champion, and was favored for the medal. The Iranian outscored the Turk 3-2 in an aggressive first round, but Bölükbaşı lost steam in the second period and was unable to answer the three points Lashgari scored on him to claim the bronze.

Hungary’s György Kozmann and György Kolonics, the latter of whom was a 1996 Olympic champion, were the reigning European champions. All of these duos were medal possibilities in the event at the 2004 Summer Olympics.
The opening heats, however, were won by Germany’s Christian Gille and Tomasz Wylenzek, the 2002 European bronze medalists, and China’s Meng Guanliang and Yang Wenjun, who had allegedly only entered the Games to practice for future competitions. They, along with the Cuban and the Polish crews, who were runners-up in China’s heat and third in Germany’s heat respectively, advanced directly to the finals. Hungary and Romania, who had been fourth in Germany and China’s heats respectively, were sent to the semi-final, in which the latter defeated the former. The final was an incredibly tight race in which everyone except the final duo, Poland, crossed within 0.932 seconds of each other. After sorting out the chaos, it was determined that China had taken a surprise gold medal, its first of any color in Olympic canoeing, while Cuba had been runner-up by 0.072 seconds and Russia’s Aleksandr Kostoglod and Aleksandr Kovalyov, the 2001 European runners-up, had taken bronze 0.092 seconds later.

Looking at the World Cup season, wins had been recorded by the Dutch twins Ronald Mulder and Michel Mulder, the defending Olympic and world champion Mo Tae-Beom, Japanese skaters Keiichiro Nagashima and Joji Kato, while there had been surprise victories from Artyom Kuznetsov, Tucker Fredricks and Gilmore Junio.
While earlier skaters raced around the 35-second mark in the first heat, Jan Smeekens was the first to set a serious mark. His 34.59 in the 15th pair would prove the fastest time in the first race. It was most closely approached by Michel Mulder, the 2013 and 2014 World Sprint Champion, who lost just 0.04. Nagashima (34.79) and Mo (34.84) were further back, but still in contention, as were Kato and Ronald Mulder (both with 34.96).
In the 17th pair of the second heat, Ronald Mulder turned up the heat by finishing in 34.49, threatening his two leading compatriots with a time just 0.07 above the 2002 Olympic Record. Twin brother Michel couldn’t match that time, but with a displayed time of 34.71, he was fast enough to be ranked first, while Mo and Kato fell behind the Dutch brothers. Smeekens needed a finishing time of 34.72 to earn the gold - and despite a wide last turn, that is exactly what he skated. Assuming he had won, he began celebrating, but right at that time a correction of Mulder’s time came in. Probably due to a failing leg responder, his time was corrected by an unusual 0.04 margin, moving Mulder from 2nd to 1st within half a lap of Smeekens finishing. In the ensuing confusion, the referees reviewed their races in thousands of seconds, even though this is normally only done in case of ties. In the final ranking, therefore, Mulder was put at 69.312 and Smeekens at 69.324 - the smallest difference ever in the two-race event at the Olympics. The Dutch, who had never won a 500 m gold medal, now swept the event, their second medal sweep in just three days.

The three US vaulters, Earle Meadows, Bill Sefton, and Bill Graber, were favored with little to choose among them. Graber had been favored in 1932 and finished out of the medals in fourth. In 1936, he would suffer a similar fate, placing fifth. Four vaulters went over 4.25 (13-11¼) – Meadows, Sefton, and two Japanese, the 1932 silver medalist, Shuhei Nishida, and Sueo Oe. But at 4.35 (14-3¼), only Meadows succeeded, clearing on his second attempt, and he had the gold medal.
Nishida, Oe, and Sefton went to a jump-off at 4.15 (13-7¼), with Sefton missing and out of the medals. It has been written more recently that the Japanese places were decided by lot or a coin toss, placing Nishida second and Oe third. However, it appears that after Sefton had been eliminated in the jump-off, the Japanese officials stepped in and chose Nishida to receive the silver medal and Oe the bronze. Several reasons are given in contemporary German sources – 1) Nishida was older, and 2) Nishida had cleared 4.25 on his first jump, while Oe failed once at that height. While there is some justification for listing both as equal second, we follow the 1936 Official Report which has Nishida second and Oe third. However, back in Japan, Nishida and Oe took their medals, cut them apart, and combined them into a half-silver, half-bronze medal, the only two of their type ever created.
The lack of countback rules resulted in an 11-way tie for sixth. One of those in =6th was Canadian Syl Apps, one of Canada’s greatest-ever athletes. He later played for 10 years with the Toronto Maple Leafs in the NHL and was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1961.

Further, with Australia attempting to make amends for its historically poor treatment of Aboriginals, Freeman was a symbol to her people.

Eriksson had also finished second at the 1946 European Championships. The Swedes were looking to sweep the medals in the 1,500, despite the absence of Andersson and Hägg.
Started in a cold rain, the final saw Belgium’s Marcel Hansenne take off at a suicidal pace, running 58.3 for the first lap and opening up a big lead. He was caught by the three Swedes shortly after finishing the second lap in the lead. Eriksson took the lead at 1,000 metres, with Strand on his heels. Together they were alone in the lead with 300 metres remaining. Despite his stronger sprint, Strand could never close the gap on Eriksson, although they ran shoulder-to-shoulder until 50 metres from the tape. Eriksson held on to win comfortably in the final straight. Strand barely held off the Dutchman, Wim Slijkhuis, who closed very quickly, passing Bergkvist on the final straight, and preventing a Swedish sweep. Slijkhuis attempted to pass Strand on the inside near the finish but Strand pulled over and bumped Slijkhuis, knocking him briefly off the track.
Although we are quite certain of the above, and of the first six finishers, places 7-12 in the final have been disputed for years and numerous orders of the runners’ finishes have been published. Here are some of the versions that are seen. Volker Kluge, in his monumental series, Olympische Sommerspiele: Die Chronik II, has as follows: 7) Sándor Garay, 8) Erik Jørgensen, 9) Josy Barthel, 10) Don Gehrmann, 11) Marcel Hansenne, 12) Denis Johansson. Ekkehard zur Megede in The Olympic Century has the following: 7) Don Gehrmann, 8) Erik Jørgensen, 9) Denis Johansson, 10) Josy Barthel, 11) Marcel Hansenne, 12) Sándor Garay. Zur Megede appears to have used material from Bob Sparks, late President of the ATFS, who looked at photofinishes of the race. In 1948 Track & Field News published the following results: 7) Erik Jørgensen, 8) Don Gehrmann, 9) Denis Johansson, 10) Josy Barthel, 11) Marcel Hansenne, 12) Sándor Garay. The results we have used are based on information from Richard Hymans, British athletics statistical expert, who has also looked at photos and films of the race, and whose results differ slightly from all the above. We have supplemented this by various descriptions from multiple national sources, including a Swedish radio report of the finish of the race, which definitively gives Garay as placing seventh.

They had to qualify in two heats with 14 teams in each. The first two from each heat, plus another six fastest teams advanced to the final. Maybe the biggest surprise in this round was the failing of the Swiss team that contained 15 km gold medalist Dario Cologna.
The heavily favored Norwegian team of Johannes Høsflot Klæbo, already a double gold medalist in PyeongChang, and Martin Johnsrud Sundby, did not waste any energy in both rounds. Then, in the fourth round, things really went off, when all of a sudden Klæbo, lying second to Aleksandr Bolshunov, started his attack and nobody followed him immediately. Even though in the next leg, the pack led by Denis Spitsov from the OAR team, and Sweden’s Marcus Hellner, almost close the gap, but Sundby maintained an extremely high pace and eventually increased the lead, when he passed on to Klæbo for his last round. On the last leg, Klæbo made it clear the he was not willing to give the others any chance of fighting for gold. Three teams, OAR, Sweden and France then battled for the other two medal places with Bolshunov holding on to second place for the OAR, but had a hard time defending it against Richard Jouve of Fance on the last stretch in the stadium. A rather exhausted Calle Halfvarsson continued Sweden’s non-medal streak with a fourth place.
The victory of Sundby and Klæbo in the men’s team sprint did not come as a surprise, like the gold of the US team in the women’s event on the same day. The Olympic Athletes from Russia confirmed their excellent performances in the previous races, although the athletes that won the last World’s title were banned from the Games. 
France’s bronze medal was their second team medal after taking bronze in the 4x10 km relay. Behind fourth-placed Sweden, were Italy and the United States in fifth and sixth, although the American Erik Bjornsen fell at the beginning of the third round. For Italy, Federico Pellegrino, the individual sprint silver medalist from the last World Championships, came nowhere near a medal in PyeongChang.

The official number of tickets sold was 106,000, while unofficial figures says that around 150,000 were gathered around Die Groβe Olympia-Schanze. On the honorary stand the leaders of the Third Reich, Führer Adolf Hitler, Generaloberst Hermann Göring and Reichsminister Dr. Joseph Goebbels could be seen together with other notables.
The usually strong Norwegian team consisted of defending champion Birger Ruud; the bronze medalist from 1932, Kåre Walberg; Reidar Andersen, three-time World Champion; and the 21-year-old, but not so merited Kongsberg-jumper, Arnholdt Kongsgård. The Swedes had great hopes for Sten Eriksson (Selånger), bronze medalist in three World Championships: 1931, 1933 and 1934. Eriksson had clearly beaten Ruud in a competition two weeks before the Olympics, and the Swedes felt they had good reasons for their optimism. Among the Middle European jumpers, a 22-year-old Polish jumper from Zakopane, Stanisław Marusarz, had shown promising things during the training jumps, and the Japanese jumpers impressed in the training sessions with long, brave and far more aerodynamic jumps than their European and North American colleagues. The landing was the big problem for the Japanese jumpers, many of their impressive jumps ending with a fall.
The huge crowd was to watch one of the closest competitions so far in the history of ski jumping. Eriksson had the longest jump in the first round (76.0 m.) and had a narrow lead over Ruud (75.0 m.), with Wahlberg in third position followed by the Finn Lauri Valonen (winner of the jumping event in the Nordic Combined earlier in the week), Andersen, Kongsgaard, Marusarz, Masaji Iguro from Japan and the US jumper, Norwegian born Sverre Fredheim, also had good jumps and were in contention for medals.  Only eight points separated the leader, Eriksson, and 10th place.
Jumping first of the favorites in the second round was Walberg, with a 73.5 m. jump he took a clear lead. Then the 21-year old Japanese Tatsuta impressed the crowd with the longest jump of the day, 77.0 m., but as in his first jump, it ended with a fall. Nobody was able to match Walberg until start number 34 Ruud was ready. The defending champion was really a man for the big events. He produced the most stylish jump of the day, one meter longer than Walberg, and took the lead. Next was first-round leader Eriksson, who equaled his first jump of 76.0 m., but with a less style points he fell 1.5 points short of beating Ruud. Next of the favorites was Andersen, fifth after the first round. An excellent jump of 75.0 m. brought him ahead of Walberg and into the bronze medal spot. Last of the favorites was Marusarz, the Polish outsider. A good length, 75.5 m., brought him from 7th to 5th place in the final classification. Ruud had defended his gold, and Eriksson had taken the first ski jumping Olympic medal for Sweden.
The young German team did well, placing 10-12-17-18; in a team competition they would have been beaten only by the Norwegians. Tragically enough, only a few years later all of them would be dead, victims of World War II.

Until PyeongChang, Niskanen was better known for his achievements in short distance races. At Sochi 2014, he took gold in the team sprint, and at the 2017 World Championships, won the 15 km classical style title. His two firsts in the World Cup also came over 15 km.
Niskanen ran the race from the lead position, increasing the pace from km 19. The leading group of 15 athletes was reduced to just seven at km 21: in addition to Niskanen Kazakhstan’s Aleksey Poltoranin, the Norwegians Martin Johnsrud Sundby and Niklas Dyrhaug, the Swiss 15 km winner Dario Cologna, Aleksandr Bolshunov, Olympic Athlete from Russia, and Canada’s Alex Harvey. At the 25 km mark, it was just Niskanen and Poltoranin with Bolshunov in third, 11 seconds behind. When Poltoranin pulled away a few kilometers later, the Finn looked like a sure winner, but the decision when to change his skies now became a tactical and decisive factor. Already with new skies, Bolshunov came back and closed the gap on Niskanen, which had increased to 25 seconds at one stage. By the time Niskanen had changed his skies at 42 km, Bolshunov had increased his lead to 14 seconds. But now it was Niskanen’s turn to chase and close in on Bolshunov. Niskanen’s tactics turned out to be the better one: With fresh skies and obviously the greater stamina, he started his final attack with just 1 km to go as Bolshunov could do nothing to counter the Finn’s attack. Niskanen celebrated the biggest individual success of his career, when he crossed the finish line after 2-08:22.1. The time, which was the slowest in the 50 km since the introduction of the separate techniques, and the mass start, in this event more than 30 years ago, and reflected the demands of the course. A disappointed Bolshunov came second 18.7 seconds behind the winner.
The bronze medal went to another Olympic Athlete from Russia. Even though he was 27-years-of-age, Andrey Larkov was competing in his first Olympics and secured third place 2:37.5 behind Niskanen. Larkov took his time and appeared in the top three for the first time after the 47 km mark. Poltoranin, who ran a lonely race for many kilometers and looked like a sure medalist until km 45, collapsed to eventually finish 15th. Harvey, the reigning world champion, and Sundby, in 2016 the last World Cup winner of a 50 km race in the classical style, finished were in the chasing group throughout the race, but finally saw Larkov pull away for his medal, while they went home without a 50 km Mass Start medal.

The individual event was won by Italy’s Alberto Braglia, who defended the individual all-around gold medal he had won at London in 1908.  In addition to his gold medal, he retained possession of the Challenge Trophy for the individual all-around.  This trophy had been donated for the 1908 Olympics by the City of Prague.

Although it was Monckton who set the best times in the preliminaries, the 18-year-old Theile was the swimmer who grabbed the opportunity to make his mark in the final.  Theile had a unique turn which seemed to help him gain time on his opponents but was of contested legality. He had been given an unofficial warning by the judges for using this turn in the heats and had decided to use a more orthodox method for the semi-final. In the final he reverted to his original technique and used it to good effect as he finished exactly a second ahead of Monckton to claim the Olympic title.
The time was later recognised as a world record when times set in a 25 m pool were deemed not eligible for record purposes.
Theile successfully defended his Olympic title in 1960 before going on to a long and successful career as a surgeon.

Other contenders were expected to be German Christin Hussong, China’s Lu Huihui, Australian Kelsey-Lee Barber, the 2019 World Champion, and the United States’ Maggie Malone. The best thrower over the last decade had been Czechian Barbora Špotáková, twice gold medalist in 2008 and 2012, and a three-time World Champion (2007, 2011, 2017), but at 40-years-old she seemed a bit past her prime, and she would fail to make the final.
Lu was the first thrower in the final and opened with 62.83, a mark that held up until the final effort in round one by her teammate, Liu Shiying, who recorded 66.34. And that would be it for the gold medal, as nobody would surpass that mark.
In a competition somewhat devoid of drama, Andrejczyk recorded 64.61 in round two, another mark that held up and brought her the silver medal. Barber moved into third in round two with 63.69 and would improve in round four to 64.04, although she was challenged in the final round when Turkey’s Eda Tugsuz threw 64.00, only to see Barber respond with her best mark of 64.56, which finalized the podium. Liu had only one other legal throw besides her opening mark, and passed in the final two rounds, confident that she had gold. It would be the first Olympic medal in the women’s javelin for China.
After the Olympics Andrejczyk made headlines when she agreed to auction off her silver medal to help pay for life-saving heart surgery for an eight-month-old Polish boy, Miłoszek Małysa. The medal earned $125,000 (US), given by Żabka, a Polish supermarket chain, that promptly then returned the medal to Andrejczyk.

Germany, with various lineups, was also the runner-up at the European championships from 2005 through 2007 and a bronze medalist at the 2008 European and 2006 World Championships. These two nations won their opening round heats and advanced directly to the finals, which the Hungarians won with ease. Poland’s Beata Mikołajczyk and Aneta Konieczna, the latter of whom had won bronze in this event at the last two Olympics, captured silver, while France’s Marie Delattre and Anne-Laure Viard, the 2005 and 2007 World and 2005 European bronze medalists, knocked Germany off the podium entirely by taking bronze.

Bliznetsov missed at 5.35 (17-6½), and Seagren passed at that height. His pass was considered unusual and he later commented that it was his unfamiliarity with the metric system, as he did not realize that 5.35 was 17-6½, which was still a big height in that era. At 5.40 (17-8½), Pennel cleared on his second effort but his pole passed under the uprights, which was illegal in that era (the rule was changed the next year), and he would settle for 5.35 (17-6½) and fifth place. Seagren, Schiprowski and Nordwig all cleared 5.40 (17-8½), Seagren and Schiprowski on the second effort, Nordwig missing twice.

The favorites included the 2020 world champion, Georgia Taylor-Brown from Great Britain, and the 2016 Olympic bronze medallist, Vicky Holland. The 2021 top event of the World Championship series in Leeds was won by Maya Kingma, and 39-year-old Nicola Spirig Hug focused on winning her third Olympic medal after gold in 2012 and silver in 2016. The race started 15 minutes late due to pouring rain, and the conditions turned out to be extremely demanding, especially later on the wet bike track.
Shortly before the start Yuliya Yelistratova caused a scandal, when the Ukrainian was excluded from the race on suspicion of doping. During a control on 5 June, a prohibited substance was discovered, but only became known now. Yelistratova was temporarily suspended and not allowed to start. From the first moment Jess Learmonth was pushing the swim pace and led the field after the first lap of 950 metres. The Briton kept up the high speed and was also the first to get out of the water after the shorter second lap. Behind her were Summer Rappaport and Vittoria Lopes.
A large bike group formed after the transition. Several crashes on the slippery surface occurred in the early laps, especially while navigating tight corners. After the first lap of 5 km a top group of seven formed. Taylor-Brown now took the lead most of the time, with the leaders already more than a minute ahead of their pursuers, but Spirig-Hug tried desperately to bridge the gap. Right at the end of the bike phase Taylor-Brown suffered bad luck with a rear-wheel puncture, but she recovered to finish only 22 seconds behind the four bike leaders.
Out of the transition zone Duffy was about to take the lead, with only American Katie Zaferes close to her in the run. Laura Lindemann was third but soon lost contact. After the first of four laps Duffy was 17 seconds ahead of Zaferes who was comfortably second. Duffy continued to increase her speed, never looking back. At the beginning of the last lap Duffy was more than a minute ahead and easily won gold. The battle for second place was decided in the last lap with Taylor-Brown overtaking Zaferes, who took bronze.
For the British overseas territory of Bermuda, with only 64,000 inhabitants, Duffy’s victory was their first Olympic gold medal and only the second medal after bronze for boxer Clarence Hill in Montréal in 1976.

For Norway, favored for a medal, the second leg turned out to be a catastrophe. Per Olsen, a 23-year-old skier from the northernmost county in Norway and not used to the bright alpine sunshine, was snow-blinded and posted only the eighth best time for the leg, over 3½ minutes behind the Soviet runner, dropping Norway to fifth place, 5:24 behind the Soviets.

The next best performances, but a long way behind Zhouyu, were from compatriots Kang Yue, second at the last Asian championships with 273 kg, and Ao Hui, world champion in 2018 with 268 kg, and Kim Un-Ju (PRK), runner-up at the last two World championships with a qualification best of 269 kg. None of those three, however, participated in Tokyo. The two Chinese lifters were prevented from competing because of the one nation per event rule, and Kim did not take part because PRK decided not to send a team to the Olympics due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Valdés had to withdraw shortly before the Games due to a shoulder injury.
Wang won the competition easily to give China their sixth weightlifting gold medal of the Games. She lifted 120 kg in snatch and 150 kg in clean & jerk for a total of 270 kg. Silver went to Salazar who enjoyed a perfect competition, and was the only lifter to successfully lift all six attempts with her best being 113 kg in snatch, and 150 kg in clean & jerk for a total of 263 kg.

None of these records were broken, which was not a surprise as none of the world standards had ever been broken.

Gustaf “Topsy” Lindblom, in his only Olympic appearance ever, had the two longest jumps with his first efforts in the qualifying, and won the gold medal easily over teammate, Georg Åberg, who had won the bronze medal in the long jump.

And the audience went wild when the 17-year old Austrian wonderboy Toni Innauer delivered a perfect first jump, 102.5 m, the longest in the competition. With high style notes he was in a clear lead, 7.7 points ahead of  the East German silver medalist from the normal hill, Jochen Danneberg. Danneberg jumped 102.0 m, but a poor landing gave him low style points. With Karl Schnabel in third, veteran Reinhold  Bachler in fourth, and Hans Wallner in seventh place, everything looked good for Austria, even if the East Germans had all their four jumpers among the ten best.
In the second round, the duel between the two leading ski jumping nations came to a climax. Bernd Eckstein from East Germany, lying fifth after the first round, took an early lead with a jump of 91.5, but Wallner brought the lead back to Austria with 92.5 m. Then Bachler jumped 91.0 m, bettering Wallner’s total points by 0.5, and Austria now held the first two spots. But Henry Glaß countered back for Eastern Germany. Lying tenth after the first round, he produced the best jump of the round with 97.0 m. The gold medalist from the normal hill, Hans-Georg Aschenbach, disappointed with 89.0 m, placing fifth to that point. Everybody’s eyes were then focused on the young Innauer. He jumped 91.0 m, a little disappointing to the crowd, but due to his excellent first jump, he brought the lead back to Austria. Danneberg was next, but he could only jump 89.5 m and was behind both Innauer and Glaß. The last of the favorites to jump was Schnabl, third after the first round, seven points behind Innauer. Could he secure an Austrian double? The 21-year old from Villach did. After copying Glaß’s length and style points, he won the gold medal, beating Innauer by 1.9 points. The Austrians had countered back, won a double and, with the other jumpers placing fourth and fifth, had their revenge on East Germany. The German quartet placed 3-4-7-8, meaning that the top eight placements were taken by jumpers from Austria and East Germany, a feat still unique in the history of ski jumping. Schnabl and Innauer ended their successful season by taking another double at Holmenkollen, this time with the best East German Danneberg a distant seventh.

The other top miler present was Britain’s dimunitive Sydney Wooderson. The top race in the year before Berlin was the Princeton Invitational mile, where Lovelock defeated Bonthron and Cunningham.
At the Olympics, most of the favorites made it thru to the final, which also included the silver and bronze medalists from Los Angeles, John “Jerry” Cornes, and Phil Edwards, as well as the USA runner, Archie San Romani, who had beaten out Bonthron at the Olympic Trials. Wooderson was the only favorite who did not come thru the heats. Cunningham went into the lead early, passing 400 metres in 61.5. The pace was slow and Cunningham led thru 800 in 2:05.2 with the field bunched. Sweden’s Eric Ny passed Cunningham on the third lap, and Lovelock moved to his shoulder at the bell. On the curve just past the line, he shot into a four-yard lead and continued to push the pace down the backstretch. Cunningham kept after him but made up no ground until Lovelock eased a bit near the finish, as he won in the world record time of 3:47.8

Larsen, Fouhy, and Brabants won their opening heats and qualified automatically for the final, with the latter doing so in Olympic record time while defeating Van Koeverden. Correa, meanwhile, was fourth in Fouhy’s heat while Amir-Tahmasseb was sixth in Larsen’s. Van Koeverden won one of the semi-final heats, eliminating Correa and Amir-Tahmasseb in the process, while Australia’s Nathan Baggaley, the 2003 World bronze medalist, took the other. Larsen took charge in the final and won gold over a second a half before Fouhy arrived for silver. The Norwegian would go on to win another medal, bronze in the K-2 1000, later that day. Van Koeverden, meanwhile, battled Baggaley down to the line and captured bronze by a mere 0.092 seconds.

The early lead in the final was taken by Germany’s Albin Killat, bronze medalist from the 1991 Worlds. But dive seven was a disaster for him and he dropped from the lead and would eventually finish 10th, after belly-flopping his eighth dive, as American Mark Lenzi took the lead. He had been trailing Tan as well, but Tan also over-rotated his seventh dive which kept him out of the top spot. Lenzi had been silver medalist at 1991 Worlds on the 1-metre springboard. He did not falter in Barcelona, holding the lead to the end to win an upset gold medal. Tan repeated his silver medal from 1988 while Dmitry Sautin of the Unified Team won bronze.
Lenzi would return in 1996 and add an Olympic bronze medal on springboard. For Tan it was his third consecutive silver medal in the event. Sautin was making his first Olympic appearance, but far from his last. He competed through the 2008 Olympics, winning an Olympic record eight diving medals, including gold in the 1996 platform and 2000 synchro platform.

Six of seven races in the giant slalom World Cup season had been held with Hölzl in the lead after two wins in Aspen and Lienz. Zettel was second with a win in Maribor and Maze was third. Poutiainen, the 2008-09 giant slalom World Cup winner and silver medalist from Torino in 2006, won the first race of the winter in Sölden and also the last World Cup race in Cortina about one month before the Olympics, while Tessa Worley won in Åre. Hölzl was also the reigning world champion from Val d’Isère in 2009 where Maze took silver and Poutiainen bronze. Also competing was Julia Mancuso, the gold medalist from Torino, who had already won two silver medals at this Games in downhill and Super Combined, but the bronze medalist from Torino, Anna Ottosson, had retired in 2007. Also absent was the 2006-07 giant slalom World Cup winner, 2007 world champion, and fourth-place finisher in Torino, Nicole Hosp, who sustained an ACL tear in her right knee on 24 October 2009 after a fall in the first race of the season in Sölden.
With fog covering the majority of the upper part of the course, and a large field, the organizers decided to start the skiers on the first run at shorter intervals than would normally be expected. Kathrin Zettel, with a time of 1:58.28, set the early pace, which was then beaten four skiers later by Taina Barioz by 0.14 seconds. Barioz held the lead until the 16th skier down, Elisabeth Görgl, who took the lead by 0.02 seconds. The next racer, downhill winner Lindsey Vonn, caught an edge in the snow and crashed out of the course. Unfortunately the defending champion, Julia Mancuso, had already started her run when Vonn crashed, so she had to stop around a third of the way down the course. Having to start her run later, and in poorer conditions, a distraught Mancuso could only finish 1.30 seconds behind Görgl in 18th place, effectively ending her chance.
However the drama didn’t end there. Deteriorating weather conditions first delayed the start of the second run, then caused its postponement to the following day, the first time this had happened since 1980, when the event was then scheduled over 2 days.
Weather also affected the second run, particularly the later starters. A brave performance by Mancuso, with what was to be the third fastest time of 1:11.24 in the second run, gave her a combined time of 2:27.66, temporarily putting her into the lead and eventually placing her eighth overall. Her lead held for some time until Fabienne Suter bettered this time with a combined total of 2:27.52. With six of the top ranked skiers to go, Viktoria Rebensburg produced a good run to give her the lead with 2:27.11. Tina Maze, following immediately afterwards, appeared set to take the lead for much of the course, but fell just 0.04 seconds short at the end to move into second place. The overnight leader, Elisabeth Görgl, briefly threatened Rebensburg’s time, but finished 0.14 seconds behind to take the bronze medal. The fastest time of the second run belonged to Denise Karbon, the 2007-08 giant slalom World Cup winner, in a time of 1:11.15, but a poor first run left her down in 23rd place.
Among the favorites, only Maze won a medal with silver. The other medalists were surprises. The 20-year-old Rebensburg had never won a World Cup race before, but had won the Super G in 2008 and 2009, as well as the giant slalom in 2009 at the World Junior Championships. Görgl had only made the team the day before when she bumped out Super G Olympic champion Andrea Fischbacher in an Austrian team qualifier. Rebensburg also won the first medal for ski manufacturer Nordica, while Maze won silver with Stöckli, and Görgl bronze on Head skis. Of note in this event is also Cynthia Denzler, Colombia’s first ever competitor in a Winter Games – sadly she did not finish her first run. However she was to have better luck in the slalom a few days later when she finished 51st.

The 2006 and 2010 champion had won the World Championships in 2011 (and was 3rd in 2012 and 2013), had won the 1,000 m World Cup in 2012 and had claimed the first three World Cup races in the running season. Behind him, there was a sizeable group of medal candidates. Mo Tae-Beom had won the most recent World Cup race, while World Sprint Champion Michel Mulder had shown his form in the 500 m. Dutch racer Kjeld Nuis had done well early in the season but had failed to qualify at the Dutch Trials, but one who defeated him in the Trials was 2012 World Champion Stefan Groothuis. Kazakh skater Denis Kuzin had surprised the field at the World Championships in Sochi a year earlier, and was hoping to repeat that performance.
The 2010 Olympic champion in the 1,500 m, Mark Tuitert, was the first to record a fast time, as his 1:09.29 remained unbeaten until pair 14, when Samuel Schwarz broke the 1:09 barrier. His time seemed good for a medal, but was beaten by compatriot Nico Ihle two pairs later. Ihle’s pairmate, Groothuis, went much quicker than that however. Groothuis, who had seen depression after winning the 2012 World Sprint Championship, combined a decent opening with two excellent laps to finish in 1:08.39, just narrowly outside the unofficial lowland World Record of 1:08.33 (held by Davis). The time was immediately challenged in the next pair. Canadian Denny Morrison was 0.01 back at the bell, but lost 0.05 seconds in the final lap to just miss Groothuis’ time. Michel Mulder was soundly beaten by Morrison, but his 1:08.74 moved him into third place. All of the remaning six skaters were essentially beaten within 600 m, none of them bettering 1:09. Defending champion Davis ranked 8th, to his disappointment. It would later be rumored that the new aerodynamic suit developed for the American team by Under Armour was counter-effective, although this was never officially confirmed.
While Groothuis’ gold medal may not have been completely expected, Morrison’s silver medal was even more unlikely. He had failed to qualify for the distance at the Canadian trials due to a fall his first attempt, and failing to make the cut by 0.10 in a re-skate. Teammate Gilmore Junio, however, had seen that Morrison was in better shape and decided to give up his own spot in favor of Morrison. In May 2014 Junio was given a special commemorative medal in Canada for his act of sportsmanship.

The fastest time of the opening round went to China’s Zhang Xiuyun, a silver medalist from the 1996 Olympic double sculls, followed by Karsten, who defeated Guerette handily in an almost meaningless heat where everyone advanced. The situation was similar for Neykova, whose heat also had absurdly slow times as all the participants conserved their energy. Other heats were won by New Zealand’s Emma Twigg, Italy’s Gabriella Bascelli, and Knapková. The potential for elimination made the quarter-finals more competitive, with heats won by Guerette, Knapková, Neykova, and Karsten. González was eliminated in Knapková’s heat, while Zhang was runner-up in Neykova’s and Bascelli and Twigg came third in Guerette’s and Karsten’s respectively. The semi-finals were even more exciting, as Karsten and Neykova faced off, with the latter winning by 0.43 seconds and both helping to eliminate Twigg. It was Zhang, however, who had the fastest time in this round, with Guerette and Knapková rounding out the three qualifiers and leaving Bascelli behind. The final was an enthralling race in which the places changed many times, but the dash for the finish line came down to a battle between Guerette and Neykova, the latter of whom was able to eke out a victory by 0.44 seconds, leaving the American with silver. Karsten, perhaps paying the price for her efforts in the semi-finals, lost to Neykova and settled for a bronze medal. Both competitors, however, now had a full set of Olympic medals in the single sculls, although Karsten had two Olympic titles and a bronze medal from the 1992 quadruple sculls as well.

The Olympic race was conducted as a final only over 25 km. Of the 23 starters, 18 finished, and all 18 were together on the final lap. The leaders on the final lap were Samokhvalova (14 pts.), Haringa (13 pts.), France’s Nathalie Even-Lancien, who had been third at the 1995 Worlds and was leading with 18 points, and the surprising Australian, Lucy Tyler-Sharman – tied for 3rd with Haringa with 13 points. Haringa won the final sprint to garner 10 points and bring her total to 23. But Even-Lancien was able to place second, and the six points she won the final sprint gave her the gold medal with 24. Tyler-Sharman placed third in the sprint, as Samokhvalova was shut out, and the )Australian) won the bronze. Tyler-Sharman was actually born in the United States, in Louisville, Kentucky. But she had been unable to earn selection for US international teams, so she moved to Australia, began competing there, and earned Australian citizenship. Tyler-Sharman was actually better known as a pursuiter, and would win the 1998 World Championship in that event, but the Australian pursuit position in 1996 was given to Kathy Watt. The ninth place finisher was Japan’s Seiko Hashimoto, who was competing in her seventh (and final) Olympics – the Winter Olympics as a speedskater in 1984, 1988, 1992, and 1994, and the Summer Olympics as a cyclist in 1988, 1992, and 1996.

Sweden (Sven Johansson and Erik Bladström) joined them halfway through the race, and attempted to pull away with the Germans, leaving Austria and the Netherlands to fight for the bronze. With one kilometre left, the leading boats were still level, leaving an exciting finish in front of the stands. The Swedes managed to pull away slightly at the end, crossing the line just three tenths ahead of the German boat.

Their final Olympic meeting in Sydney was considered by some as one of the highlights of the Games.
By the time of Athina both horses had long retired and Werth was not even on the German team. Van Grunsven travelled as part of the Dutch team albeit with low expectations following a series of personal setbacks and the mantle of favorite had passed to Sydney bronze medallist Ulla Salzgeber of Germany. Van Grunsven, Sweden’s Jan Brink, Beatriz Ferrer-Salat of Spain and the rest of the German team were expected to challenge.
With the elimination on medical grounds of one of the Greek horses and the withdrawal of a Swiss entrant there were 51 starters for the first phase of the event. These first two days of competition doubled as both the team event and the first round of the individual event, the top 25 riders moving into the second phase of competition although no more than three riders from each country could progress. Salzgeber’s test put her in a clear lead of over 3.5 points, the difference between the leader and second being more than the difference between second and twelfth place. Ferrar-Salat and Van Grunsven occupied second and third with Schaudt of Germany and Debbie McDonald of America on their heels.
If Salzgeber had been outstanding in the first stage of the event it was the turn of Van Grunsven and her horse Salinero to excel in the second phase, the Grand Prix Special Test. Van Grunsven’s score of 77.80 was nearly three whole points clear of Salzgeber although the German maintained a small overall lead of half a point. Another solid performance from Ferrar-Salat put her in third place ahead of McDonald. Relatively disappointing displays by Brink and Schaudt suggested that the first four riders would contest the medals.
In the deciding kür segment (freestyle to music) van Grunsven entered the arena before Salzgeber. Performing to a piece entitled “Esprit Chanson (The Spirit of the Song)” by the Dutch composers Cees Slings and Viktor Kerkhof, Salinero barely made an error and received a number of perfect tens from the judges. A superb score of 85.525 meant that Salzgeber would have to perform at the highest level to secure the championship. Salzgeber’s final score of 83.450 had only been beaten by Van Grunsven in Olympic kür tests but was not enough to deny the Dutchwoman successive Olympic championships. She became only the third rider to retain the individual title and the first to win individual medals in three successive games. Beatriz Ferrer-Salat’s bronze medal was Spain’s first individual medal in Olympic dressage.
At the time of the Athina Games van Grunsven was over five months pregnant, and her first son Yannick was born on 23 November 2004.

This was his last chance for individual gold in 1968 as he had so far won only a silver and a bronze in his individual races. In the final, all three American swimmers false started when they hopped in the pool early, protesting the official’s ruling of not allowing the swimmers in the pool to get wet before the race. After the actual start, Robie took the lead at 100 metres with Spitz surprisingly last at that point. He was challenged on the third lap by Britain’s Martyn Woodroffe, but Robie never lost the lead and held on in the final lap to win gold by 0.3 seconds, Woodroffe placing second. John Ferris of the United States was third for most of the race and won the bronze medal, with Spitz a badly beaten eighth and last in the final. He would do a bit better in 1972, winning gold in this race, and fulfilling his prediction there to win seven gold medals.

In Berlin the country was represented by the University of Washington, winners of the 1936 Intercollegiate Rowing Association (IRA) Regatta, who had been forced to raise their own funds to travel to Europe. In the opening round only Great Britain came close to the Americans’ time; every other nation was at least six seconds slower. Hungary (the 1933-1935 European champions) and Switzerland also won their heats and advanced to the final, while the remaining nations competed in the semi-final, which served as a repêchage. Great Britain, who had been in the Americans’ heat, won easily, while Italy and Germany took the final two spots for the final. It should be noted, however, that Canada had a faster time than the Italians, while both France and Japan were faster than the Germans.
In the final the Germans and the Swiss took the lead from the beginning but four of the latter’s crew, Hermann Betschart, Alex and Hans Homberger, and Karl Schmid, had already competed in the finals for the coxed and coxless fours that day and their exhaustion hampered them. Italy passed the Germans after the first third of the race, but it was not until about the last third that the United States made their move. Only one second separated the medals, but the Americans continued their undefeated streak by capturing the gold. The Italians settled for silver while Germany took bronze, making the eights one of only two rowing events in Berlin that they did not win. In June 2013 a book entitled The Boys in the Boat, by author Daniel James Brown, chronicled the story of the University of Washington crew and became a bestseller in the United States.

Not so lucky was track worker Drake Self as he had the top of the index finger sliced off attempting to retrieve her sled.

In the heats the newness of the event was evident when one runner fell face-first into the water jump. The 2007 champion was Yekaterina Volkova but the world record holder was her teammate Gulnara Samitova-Galkina, who had set it back in 2004. Samitova-Galkina had run at the Athina Olympics in the 5K, placing sixth. In the final, Samitova-Galkina took the lead early and pulled along four other runners – Tatyana Petrova (RUS), Eunice Jepkorir (KEN), Ruth Bisibori (KEN), and Zemzem Ahmed (ETH). After 1,000 metres only Petrova and Jepkorir remained with Samitova-Galkina, but at 2K, she was running alone. She won by half the final straight in 8:58.81, a world record, and became the first woman to break 9-minutes for the steeple. Jepkorir held on for the silver medal. Volkova had not been a factor early, but caught the chase group at the bell, and was able to pull away for the bronze medal.
That was how the event and the results seemed to have ended. In 2015, however, the IOC began re-testing samples from the 2008 Beijing and 2012 London Olympics, using newer, more advanced testing techniques, in an effort to find those who had used performance enhancing drugs (PEDs), but in whom it could not be detected at the time of those Olympics. This was one of the many events affected.
In October 2016 Yekaterina Volkova of Russia was revealed to have a positive re-test for turinabol (dehydrochloromethyltestosterone), and was disqualified, losing her bronze medal, which was re-assigned to her teammate, Tatyana Petrova.

However, a new rule allowed the team to substitute any of their gymnasts into the all-around final and Amânar was moved ahead of Alexandra Marinescu.
The final was desparately close, with six gymnasts in sight of gold after three rotations, but Miller, who would finish eighth, was not one of them. Podkopaieva performed on the floor exercise for her last rotation and her score of 9.887 was the highest of the women’s all-around competition on any apparatus and brought her the gold medal.

Seales was drawn against the reigning European Champion, Ulrich Beyer of East Germany. The bout lived up to expectations as first Seales and then Beyer took the upper hand over the course of the fight. The fight was effectively decided in the last minute when Seales launched a blistering attack which shook his opponent to his boots. It was enough give the American the win in the eyes of three of the five judges. Despite another close call in the quarter-finals Seales advanced to the final where he would face Angel Angelov of Bulgaria. The gold medal bout was a textbook clash between the upright technical Eastern European style of Angelov and the looser, more aggressive American. With little to choose between the two men the decisive moment came in the first round when Seales knocked the Bulgarian to the floor. After the Olympics Seales embarked on a professional career. He fought some of the best boxers in the middleweight division including world champions Marvin Hagler and Alan Minter but, although he held the North American championships, never managed to get a shot at the world title. He suffered serious damage to his retina during his career and was declared legally blind in the mid-eighties. Seales later worked with autistic high school students.

In addition to the officially qualified 17 paddlers, five other athletes competed, having already earned a quota in the Women’s K-1 event.
Jessica Fox of Australia was the clear favourite, and had campaigned for the C-1 discipline to be added to the Olympic programme to ensure full gender parity in the canoe events. The 27-year-old had previously won K-1 silver at London 2012, and bronze in both Rio, and Tokyo, the latter just two days before the inaugural C-1. Fox’s seven gold medals in individual events (four in C-1 and three in K-1) made her the most successful paddler, male or female, in the history of the World Championships. She also won a gold medal in the K-1 event at the 2010 Summer Youth Olympics. Another medal contender was Andrea Herzog from Germany, the reigning world champion, and Mallory Franklin from Great Britain, the 2017 world champion.
In the preliminaries, Franklin and Herzog occupied the first two positions. Fox made two mistakes, finishing with only the fifth best qualifying time. In both the semis and final, Fox recorded the best times, with big margins over the second-best competitors. In the final, Fox finished her run error-free and with a time that would have placed her sixth in the men’s canoe final earlier in the week. Her time was also better than the winning time in the women’s kayak final two days earlier. Kayak times are almost always faster than those of canoe.
Eleven years after winning gold at the Youth Olympic Games (YOG) at Singapore in 2010, Fox made it back on top of an Olympic podium, as she clinched the first ever women’s C-1 canoe slalom title in Tokyo. Franklin won silver, and Herzog bronze. For both, it was the first Olympic medal. Fox took her medal tally to four and no other female paddler has won more than three individual Olympic medals as Fox also became the first athlete to win two individual medals at a single Games.

Besides his Olympic victories and World Championships gold he had won six national championships in the period 1973-1979 and was triumphant at Holmenkollen three years in a row – 1975, 1976 and 1977. His only international Championship defeat came at the 1978 World Championships in Lahti, were he finished third after his teammate Konrad Winkler and his arch-rival, the Finn Rauno  Miettinen. However, Wehling, still only 27, was only one of four main favorites for the 1980 Olympic gold. Winkler, reigning World Champion, was to be considered, and Norway had hopes to regain their supremacy in the event through Tom Sandberg, Norwegian Champion six times in a row between 1975 and 1980. Finland had produced a great prospect in 23-year old Jouko Karjalainen, an excellent cross-country skier who was dangerous if he could do well in the ski jumping.
Wehling started the competition well. He won the jumping by a comfortable margin, with the best jump in both of the first two rounds, producing the longest jump of the day in the second round with 85.0 m. Second was an unknown American, Walter Malmquist, and third a West German teenager, Hubert Schwarz. Winkler, who placed fifth in ski jumping, had to beat Wehling by 1:25 in the cross country event, and Karjalainen (1:58 back) and Sandberg (2:39 back) were still in contention for the medals. Malmquist and Schwartz were considered too weak in the cross-country event to have any impact on the medal race.
In the 15 km cross-country phase, Wehling had the advantage of starting behind his rivals, Winkler and Karjalainen. The most dangerous attack came from the Finn. After 5 km he had a ½-minute lead over Wehling, and at 10 km the lead had increased to one minute, but Karjalainen had to gain another minute during the last 5 km, an almost impossible task.  Wehling controlled the last part of the race and won his third consecutive Olympic Nordic Combined gold medal, a feat not performed before or since. Karjalainen, with the best cross-country time, advanced to the silver position, and Winkler, as in 1976, had to be content with the bronze medal. Sandberg edged out the East German Uwe Dotzauer in a close duel for fourth place. Miettinen, a shadow of his former self, ended in 23rd place, failing totally on the jumping hill.

The 2011 World Champion had been Britain’s Dai Greene, and these five would be joined in the final by three other Caribbean hurdlers – Javier Culson of Puerto Rico, Jehue Gordon of Trinidad & Tobago, and Jamaican Leford Green. Culson had been the strongest early in 2012, had been silver medalist at the Worlds in both 2009 and 2011, and was considered a slight favorite.
The early leaders were Sánchez, Culson, and Taylor with Taylor leading over hurdle seven. But he switched to a right-leg lead at the next hurdle and had difficulty with his steps coming home. Sánchez took the lead at the ninth hurdle, just ahead of Culson. Tinsley was not in it for the gold but had the fastest finish to come home for silver, just behind Sánchez, who won gold, with Culson taking bronze, Greene in fourth, and Taylor fifth.
Féliz Sánchez became the third intermediate hurdler to win the title twice without defending his title, following Taylor in 2000 and 2008, and Edwin Moses in 1976 and 1984. Glenn Davis (USA) also won the event twice, consecutively in 1956-60.

Additionally, she was the world record holder, having recorded 7:20.36 at Heerenveen in the previous season. Her main rival was thought to be Andrea Ehrig. Since the 5,000 m had been re-introduced in women’s allround skating in 1983, Ehrig had been the fastest in the distance in at all World Championships since then, and had not lost an international 5,000 m since 1985. Like Van Gennip, Ehrig had also medalled in the 1,500 m (bronze) and 3,000 m (silver).
As in the 3,000 m, Ehrig was the first to set a mark, starting in pair one. She was also the first to break the world record, as she had done in the 3,000 m. Her 7:17.12 was three seconds under the previous best, and was sufficient to keep Gabi Zange-Schönbrunn behind her. Also a former world record holder, Zange narrowly beat her personal best (from the Calgary World Cup in December), posting 7:21.61. This left more than enough room for Van Gennip. Up until the half-way point, she kept equal with Ehrig, before slowly edging away from the East German. Van Gennip’s final time of 7:14.13 was nearly three seconds faster than Ehrig, and six seconds below her own former world record.

None of these nations, however, would win a medal at the 1968 Games. The reigning World Champions, the Soviet Union, represented by Oleksandr Shaparenko and Volodymyr Morozov, the latter of whom was a 1964 Olympic champion in the K-4 1000, had much better luck.

Samadov had also recently won the 1992 Europeans, in a close contest with Pyrros Dimas of Greece and Poland’s Krzysztof Siemion. Dimas was a native Albanian who competed for that nation at the 1990 European Championships but had emigrated to Greece in 1991 with his brother, and was granted Greek citizenship almost immediately.
The event turned out to be one of the closest in Olympic history. Samadov, Dimas, and Siemion all tied with 370.0 kg, with Siemion moving up with the best clean & jerk of 205.0 kg. Dimas and Siemion both weighed 81.80 kg, while Samadov weighed 81.85 kg, which dropped him back to the bronze medal. In a new weightlifting rule, first used at the 1992 Olympics, the tie between Dimas and Siemion was broken by whichever lifter posted the final total first. This was Dimas, who lifted 202.5 kg in the clean & jerk, before Siemion hoisted his 205.0 kg. Dimas would become one of the greatest lifters ever in the next few years, winning this class again at the 1996 and 2000 Olympics, and winning a bronze medal in 2004.
So the podium seemed set, with Dimas first, Siemion second, and Samadov third, but Samadov was not happy. He was known to be high-strung and a perfectionist and at the medal ceremony, he refused to lean forward to receive the bronze medal. He then took it in his hand and dropped it onto the podium and walked away. The IOC was incensed and disqualified Samadov, leaving the bronze medal position open. He apologized the next day, but the ruling stood, and the International Weightlifting Federation banned him for life.

She had rarely lost since Vancouver but after winning the 2013 World Championship, took a sabbatical and came to Sochi somewhat untested of late. If she did not win, the Russian crowd looked to 15-year-old hyper-flexible wunderkind Yuliya Lipnitskaya, who had recently won the European Championship and Skate Canada and had wowed the crowd with her performance during the team trophy competition in Sochi. Japan’s Mao Asada, the 2010 silver medalist, was also given consideration for the Olympic title.
In the short program, Kim showed she had little rust from the lay-off, skating ethereally, so much so that one Olympic writer tweeted, “Her skating would have made a lumberjack cry.” She led, but barely over Russia’s little known Adelina Sotnikova, with Italy’s Carolina Kostner, the 2012 World Champion but a veteran looking for her first Olympic medal, in third. Lipnitskaya struggled in the short and was only in fifth place, while Asada skated terribly for her, placing 16th, and ending her medal hopes.
Sotnikova had been runner-up at the 2013 and 2014 European Championships, and had been 2011 World Junior Champion, but had never skated at the World Championships or Olympics, and the gold medal seemed to be conceded to Kim. In the free skate she performed last and again skated beautifully, with no major flaws. But Sotnikova won the free skate and defeated Kim for the gold medal, by a fairly comfortable margin, presumably based on greater difficulty in her free skate, which included a triple Lutz-triple toe loop and a double axel-triple toe loop combination. Kostner took the bronze medal. Asada redeemed herself with a beautiful free skate that moved her up to sixth place overall.
After the competition there was some minor controversy about the judging, with fans and some experts claiming the result was flawed because of Russian bias. It appeared to die out quickly but then one month after the Olympics ended, the Korean Skating Federation protested the result to the International Skating Union (ISU), claiming prejudice on the judging panel, which had several judges from former Soviet republics.
Kim retired from Olympic-style competition after the Olympics ended. Lipnitskaya finished in fifth place, behind American Gracie Gold. For the first time since 1936 at the Olympics, no American man or woman won a medal in singles competition.

The downhill started at 9:30 AM, with cold sunny weather. Julia Mancuso with was the first of the favorites and set the first top time. Lindsey Vonn started with number 18. She lost 0.23 seconds at the first intermediate split, but topped all other times and finished first, 0.8 seconds in front of Mancuso. After Vonn, Riesch started with number 19 and at the beginning it looked like that she was again struggling. But she found her speed at the end of the race and finally placed second only 33 hundredths of a second behind Vonn. Also Pärson finished the race in a top 10 position when placed seventh, 1.41 seconds behind Vonn. The slalom started at 12:30 PM. Pärson, seventh after the downhill, managed to take the lead. The sensational Pärson was still in the lead when the three leaders started. Mancuso, having won silver in the downhill the day before, raced a fine slalom and took the lead, 0.11 hundredths of a second in front of Pärson. But Riesch skied a great slalom and bettered Mancuso by 0.94 seconds. Then the top favorite and leader after the downhill, Lindey Vonn started. At the second intermediate split Vonn was only in second place, 0.18 seconds behind Riesch, but then hooked a gate and lost her right ski. So Riesch (on Head), after her disappointing downhill, won gold, Mancuso using Rossignol again won a silver medal, and the phenomenal Pärson (also on Head) took bronze, while Zettel (Atomic) and Maze (Stöckli) placed next to the podium. The first eight finishers represented eight different countries.

With Cavagnoud out, the event was wide open, though it was contested under a pall. The early leader was Italy’s Karen Putzer, who posted 1:13.86. But the ninth starter was another Italian, unheralded Daniela Ceccarelli, and she bested her teammate with 1:13.59. After the 15 seeds finished, the next starter was Croatian Janica Kostelić, who had already won the combined in Salt Lake. Kostelić passed Putzer to move into second place, but the gold medal went to Ceccarelli in a major upset. She had only once before been on the podium in a World Cup race.

The heats saw both Australians, Jack McLoughlin and Elijah Winnington, and both Americans, Kieran Smith and Jake Mitchell, qualify comfortably. The last qualifier was Tunisia’s Ahmed Hafnaoui, who set a personal best to get into the final.
Winnington led for the first 150 metres when McLoughlin took over and led through 350 metres of the final. However, out in lane eight, Hafnaoui moved into second at 150 metres and stayed there through 350 metres, when he picked it up and gradually moved past McLoughlin for one of the biggest upsets of the Tokyo Olympics in swimming, as Hafnaoui won gold in 3:43.36, a PR by over two seconds, with McLoughlin taking silver, and Kieran Smith coming on for bronze.
Hafnaoui’s gold medal was the second in the pool for Tunisia after Oussama Mellouli’s gold in the 1,500 freestyle at the 2008 Beijing Olympics – Mellouli also won gold in open water swimming at the 2012 London Olympics. For Hafnaoui gold came in the first major international meet of his career.

The vault was the only piece of apparatus in which Biles came first in qualifying. Because of her mental health issues in Tokyo, however, Biles pulled out of the competition and her place was taken by fellow American MyKala Skinner. The oldest female gymnast in Olympic history, 46-year-old Oksana Chusovitina, was competing in her eighth Games in Tokyo, and it was to be her final Olympics. After finishing 14th in the qualifying competition for the vault, she emotionally announced her retirement to a standing ovation from her fellow competitors.
The first vault in the final was from MyKala Skinner, and she set an impressive mark of 14.916, but, two vaults later, Brazil’s individual all-round silver-medallist Rebeca Andrade scored 15.083 thanks to her difficult two-and-a-half twisting vault. It turned out to be a gold medal performance after America’s Jade Carey, second to Biles in qualifying, disappointed with a 12.416, which put her in last place. Of the rest, the best score was from Korea’s Yeo Seo-Jeong, whose 14.733 secured her the bronze medal behind Skinner. Three days before the vault final, Brazil had never won a women’s gymnastics medal now, thanks to Andrade, they had doubled that total, and also won their first ever gold.
The vault competition in Tokyo was conducted in an unusual manner. As in previous recent Games, the team and individual all-around qualifying served as qualifying for the various apparatus finals. In vault, however, all the competitors in those qualifications did one vault, which counted towards the team and individual events, but 19 competitors did a second vault, effectively competing in a special vault apparatus qualifying, and that is why only 19 competitors are listed in this event.

Thus, if a skater was ranked first by a majority of the judges, that skater was placed first overall for that section, with the tiebreakers being Required Elements for the Original Set Pattern Dance, and Artistic Impression for the Free Dance.  Ties were broken by a Subsequent Majority rule, i.e., if the couples were ranked for the same position by the same number of judges, Majority Placement for the next higher position for each couple determined who was ranked higher.  The tiebreakers were then, in order: 1) Number of Majority Placements, 2) Total Ordinals of Majority, 3) Total Ordinals.  Final placement was determined by factored placements.  The placement for the Compulsory Dances was factored by 0.6 (30%), the placement for the Original Set Pattern Dance was factored by 0.4 (20%), and the placement for Free Dance was factored by 1.0 (50%).  The sums of the factored placements were then used to determine final placement, with the Free Dance being the tiebreaker.",na,"It was not of a question of who would win this event, but by how much. British skaters Jayne Torvill and Christopher Dean had interrupted the Soviet dominance of pairs and dance skating by winning the Worlds in 1981-83. T&D, as they were called, were the most innovative dance couple ever. They restored British pre-eminence in this event, as it was almost completely dominated by British couples prior to it being placed on the Olympic program. At the 1984 European Championships, shortly before Sarajevo, they had won and received 18 perfect 6.0 scores for their free dance routine, performed to Ravel’s Bolero. In Sarajevo, they easily won the compulsory dance and optional set dance phases, taking a comfortable lead into the free dance. Skating again to Bolero, they mesmerized the audience with a stunning routine, for which they received 12 of 18 perfect 6s, and nine of nine for artistic impression. Two Soviet couples placed second and third, but they were hardly noticed in the frenzy over T&D’s skating.
There had been some complaints from other coaches, notably the Soviets, that the British free dance routine violated the ice dancing rules, which required skaters to use several different pieces of music. Bolero was one set piece, but its different rhythms and phases convinced the judges that it was legal. T&D turned professional after Sarajevo. When professionals were allowed to skate in international competition, they returned to win the 1994 European Championships and placed third at the 1994 Lillehammer Olympics.

56369,"Marathon, Men",1908 Summer Olympics,5,Athletics,/editions/5/sports/ATH,24 July 1908 — 14:33,"White City Stadium, London",55 from 16 countries,"42,195 metres (26 miles, 385 yards) point-to-point.",na,"The race started by the East Terrace of Windsor Castle. It has been written (including by our group) that this was done because it was under the windows of the nursery to allow the Princes a good view of the start, but this is certainly false, and has been shown to be so by Bob Wilcock, in his article in Journal of Olympic History, “The 1908 Olympic Marathon” (March 2008, Vol 16, No 1; 31-47), and David Davis, in his book, Showdown at Shepherd’s Bush - The 1908 Olympic Marathon and the Three Runners Who Launched a Sporting Craze.
In fact, notices in The Sporting Life as early as November 1907 note that the Organizing Committee was attempting to receive permission to start the race at Windsor Castle, with no requests from the Royal Family to do so. By April 1908 it was noted that the starting point was confirmed as “on or near the East Lawn below the east terrace of the Castle”, although it was still subject to the King’s consent. It was suggested that this was done to avoid any public interference with the start of the race.
The race was started concurrently by Lord Desborough and Jack Andrew, secretary of the Polytechnic Harriers, after they had been given a signal by Princess Mary, which was transmitted to their car. The distance to the finish in front of the Royal Box in the White City Stadium was precisely 26 miles, 385 yards (42,195 metres) and this rather arbitrary distance, which had no particular historical or athletic significance, eventually became the internationally accepted distance for the marathon footrace, declared so by the IAAF in 1921, and used at the Olympics again since 1924.
With a field of 55 runners from 16 nations this was by far the most international field yet assembled for a marathon and the British, quite unrealistically, entertained hopes of considerable success but eight of the 12 British starters failed to finish the race.  Another fancied runner who also dropped out was the Canadian, Tom Longboat, who was competing in the face of American protests.  The Americans claimed that Longboat was a professional but the Organizing Committee eventually allowed Longboat to compete.  Other starters included Georg Lind (19th), a London-based Russian from Estonia who became the first Russian to compete in an Olympic track & field event, and the English-born Canadian, George Goulding (22nd), who would win the 10 km. walk at the 1912 Games.  All of the runners were accompanied by two attendants on bicycles, many of them Olympic cycling competitors, who met them at the Crooked Billet Inn at the six-mile mark.
It was a very warm day for long-distance running, the temperature eventually reaching 78° F. (26° C.).  Scotsman Thomas Jack led for the first five miles, but dropped out shortly thereafter.  Fred Lord and Jack Price, both British, then ran together in the lead through 10 miles.  At that mark Price pulled away, closely followed by the English-born South African, Charles Hefferon, who had always been near the lead.  Tom Longboat was in second as far out as 17 miles, but he withdrew by 20 miles.  After the excessive heat had taken its toll, the race came down to three runners by the 20 mile mark: Hefferon, the American Johnny Hayes, and Italy’s Dorando Pietri.  Hefferon had control of the race from 15 through 25 miles, leading Pietri by over 3 minutes at 20 miles.
A little more than one mile from the finish Pietri moved into the lead, passing Hefferon.  However, the effort cost him dearly and Pietri entered the White City Stadium in an advanced state of exhaustion.  He stumbled and fell, but doctors and attendants revived him, administering stimulants, and helping him to his feet.  He then fell four more times over the final lap, each time being helped by his handlers.  He eventually staggered across the finish line, while surrounded by officials, doctors, and attendants.  John Hayes crossed the line, unaided, more than 30 seconds later and, after Pietri had been disqualified for receiving assistance, the American was rightly declared the Olympic champion.
The official statement read, “That, in the opinion of the judges, M. P. Dorando would have been unable to finish the race without the assistance rendered on the track, and so, therefore, the protest of the U.S.A. is upheld, and the second man, Mr. J. Hayes, is the winner, the protest being made by the South African team being withdrawn.”  Pietri quickly recovered from his ordeal and returned to the Stadium the next day to receive a special award from the Queen.
Gynn and Martin described the assistance given Pietri, “The assistance given to Pietri was primarily by Jack Andrew, the Honorary General Secretary of the Polytechnic Harriers and the key organizer of the race.  He followed instructions of the medical officer for the race, Doctor Bulger.  He [Andrew] reported, in the August, 1908, issue of The Polytechnic Magazine, ‘As regards the actual finish, most of the reports of same are absolutely erroneous regards my assisting the winner - the doctor’s instructions were emphatic, carrying them out caused disqualification; as the animated photographs show, I only caught Dorando as he was falling at the tape.  What I did then I would do again under similar circumstances.’”
After the Olympic Games both Hayes and Pietri turned professional and Pietri won each of their four subsequent encounters in New York and San Francisco.  To this day, Dorando Pietri is bettered remembered than the Olympic champion, John Hayes.  Born 16 October 1885 in Mandrio, Reggio Emilia, Italy, Dorando Pietri is the most famous loser in Olympic history.  But he had an excellent career as a marathon runner.  He won his first marathon in 1906 in Rome, but failed to finish the 1906 Olympic marathon a month later.  He had won a 40 km. marathon in Carpi, Italy only 17 days before the Olympic marathon.  As a professional marathoner he won 7 of 12 of his professional races.  He retired in 1911, having won 38 of 59 amateur races and 50 of 69 professional races.
Although the 1908 Olympic marathon is best remembered for the disqualification of Pietri, this does less than justice to John Hayes, who was correctly determined to be the champion, and was an excellent marathon runner in his own right.  He had been born in America soon after his parents emigrated from Ireland, and his initial success came when he took third place in the 1907 Boston Marathon.  Later in the season he won the Yonkers Marathon then, by finishing second in the 1908 Boston race, Hayes won a spot on the Olympic team.
After his Olympic victory, Hayes paid a brief visit to his grandparents in Ireland and then returned to New York where Bloomingdale’s had plastered their department store with photographs of Hayes and announced that their employee, who had been rumored to train on the store track on the roof, had been promoted to manager of sporting goods.  Years later, Hayes laid to rest this oft-repeated bit of Olympic lore.  He never did actually work at Bloomingdale’s, or train on the roof.  He drew a salary from Bloomingdale’s but most of his time was spent training at a track outside Manhattan.
Hayes was interviewed on the night of the race, “I took nothing to eat or drink on the journey.  I think to do so is a great mistake.  Before starting I partook of a light lunch, consisting of two ounces of beef, two slices of toast and a sup of tea.  During the race I merely bathed my face with Florida water and gargled my throat with brandy.
I ran my own race throughout, covering in almost mechanical fashion the first five or six miles at a rate of six minutes a mile.  After that I went as hard as I could to the finish.  Ten miles from home I was ten minutes behind the leader, and then I began to go through the field.  I passed Hefferon on nearing the Stadium, but saw nothing of Dorando until I entered the arena. I do not smoke and I drink only in moderation.”
Hefferon also commented, “The conditions of the race - weather, roads, &c. - suited me exactly, and I should have won the event.  Two miles from home, however, I accepted a draught of champagne and this mistake cost me the race.  The drink gave me a cramp a mile from the finish and then I lost my lead.”
The tragic sight of Dorando Pietri attempting to finish the 1908 marathon race, despite a body that had betrayed him, touched many people.  One of those people was a young, aspiring songwriter who wrote a song about Pietri.  Entitled simply “Dorando”, it was one of the first of many hits for Irving Berlin.

In the intervening years, however, China’s strength had waned while Great Britain remained a force, one that would certainly be amplified by competing in a home Olympics. It was the Ukrainian team, however, that had garnered the most attention during the last season. Although the squad had been successful in past years, it was also uneven, but an intense training regimen for both endurance and strength boosted the team’s performance and left them with a string of victories on the international scene going into the event, including all three of the year’s World Cup regattas. Germany was also an ever-present threat; aside from being the reigning World Champions, they had won gold in the event every year since its début at the Olympics in 1988, save for 2008.
Unsurprisingly it was Germany and Ukraine that captured their respective heats, leaving the other nations to battle for a spot in the finals in the repêchage. Perhaps more surprising was that China and Britain finished at the bottom of the pack and narrowly avoided elimination in a repêchage won by Australia. China, which finished fourth, might have been eliminated had the New Zealand squad, bronze medalists at the most recent World Championships, not broken a blade with less than 500m to go in the race. The final was dominated by the Ukrainians, who remained an entire length ahead of the pack for almost the entire course and easily captured the gold medal, the nation’s first ever victory in Olympic rowing. Germany clinched silver in a tight drive for second place and the United States, who had taken silver in the 2011 World Championships, settled for bronze.

At first, although it was known she had disappeared, it was not certain if she had defected. But a week later she retained immigration lawyer Wilifredo “Willy” Allen and applied for political asylum. Laborde commented on her defection, “A Cuban athlete’s life is a hard, complicated life with a lot of sacrifice involved. You don’t see the fruits of your labor. I played for 12 years on the national team, and I was never able to get a home or a car. I was twice the champion of the world, and I couldn’t have a home or a car.”
In Laborde’s absence the class was relatively open, although Japan’s Sae Nakazawa had been runner-up at the last two Worlds. But Nakazawa lost her opening round match to Italy’s Lucia Morico, and would not even get to the repêchages. Cuba had selected Yalennis Castillo to replace Laborde. She made it to the final where she faced China’s Yang Xiuli. Castillo had no international record while Yang had won only a bronze at the 2006 Asian Games. The final was long, dull, and passive. It went to extra time and after five minutes of golden score time, no points had been scored. Yang was declared the winner by yusei-gachi in the hantei. The two bronze medalists were Stéphanie Possamai (FRA) and Jeong Gyeong-Mi (KOR), who had also been the bronze medalists at the 2007 Worlds.

Ties broken by lightest bodyweight.,na,"Traditionally, since 2004, the lightest weight class for women was also contested as the first weightlifting event at the Tokyo Olympics. It was also the second medal to be decided in all sports at these Games. As the weight classes changed in 2018, the body weight was now up to 49 kg as opposed to 48 kg in Rio five years before. The field of 14 athletes included Hou Zhihui, winner of the 2018 World Championships, silver medallist in 2019, winner of the last two Asian Championships in 2019 and 2020 (held in April 2021), and the current world record holder in snatch (96 kg) and total (213 kg). She set both records about three months before the Olympics, at the Asian Championships. At these Championships, a new world record in clean & jerk with 119 kg was also set by third placed Mirabai Chanu, but who was the 2017 world champion, and Commonwealth Games champion in 2018, with both events contested in the old 48 kg class, and she had a season best in total with 205 kg. Also present in this weight division was Jourdan Delacruz, season best in total 200 kg, the Pan American Championship winner in 2019 (55 kg) and 2020 (held April 2021). Beatriz Pirón, the 2019 Pan American Games champion, and Windy Aisah, junior world champion 2021, were also in the field. Ludia Montero, silver medallist at the 2019 World Championships in the non-Olympic -45 kg class was the only lifter from this weight class to qualify for Tokyo after moving up to this category. Of the medallists from Rio, only third-placed Hiromi Miyake, having also won silver in London, took part again on home soil and competed in her fifth Olympics.
As only one athlete per nation was allowed to compete Jiang Huihua, season best in total 207 kg, was absent from Tokyo. She was the 2014 Youth Olympics gold medallist and in 2019 retained her world title, where she set a world record in total, which was surpassed by her teammate Hou only three months before the Tokyo Olympics. Hayley Marie Reichardt (season best 189 kg) from the United States was unable to compete in Tokyo because of the one athlete per nation rule. The Thai gold medallist from Rio, Sopita Tanasan, and her compatriot Chayuttra Pramongkhol were both convicted of doping. Pramongkhol lost her gold medal from the 2018 World Championships and also the world records both lifters had set had been nullified. These were just two of the huge number of doping offences in Thailand, which led to them being one of four nations to be excluded from the weightlifting at the Tokyo Olympics. Another excluded nation was Romania, and this prevented the 2021 European champion Monica Csengeri from participating in Tokyo, but she had already tested positive in 2018. This made Kristina Sobol from Russia, qualification best 187 kg, the highest placed European competitor in this class. Originally qualified for this event was Vương Thị Huyền, but she was not nominated by her federation as Vietnam was restricted to one male and one female lifter over all classes as a result of 20 doping violations.
When the strongest snatcher, Hou, lifted 88 kg in her first attempt, only two other athletes were still competing, but both Chanu and Delacruz failed to lift 89 kg. Hou went on to lift 92 kg and 94 kg in her next attempts for a solid lead after snatch, with Chanu in second place with 87 kg followed by Delacruz (86 kg) and Aisah (84 kg). Hou was untouchable, and in clean & jerk lifted all her three attempts to finally clear 116 kg as she also cleared all three snatch attempts. She was the only lifter in this event to do so. The best clean & jerker, Chanu, failed to lift her last attempt for 117 kg, but she had already lifted 115 kg in her second try to secure a clear silver medal. As Delacruz failed to lift any weight in clean & jerk, she missed 108 kg three times, Aisah won bronze after clearing 110 kg for a total of 194 kg. The best lifter from group B, held in the morning, was the Cuban Montero, with a total of 178 kg, which finally placed her sixth.
The Olympic Standard for Olympic records was 89 kg for snatch, 111 kg for clean & jerk, and 198 kg for total. The snatch record was broken twice by Hou with 92 kg and 94 kg. The clean & jerk record was first reached by Hou with 114 kg, then bettered by Chanu with 115 kg, and finally went back to Hou with 116 kg. The total record was first set by Hou in her first clean & jerk attempt totalling 203 kg and increased by her to 208 kg and then to 210 kg.
This result meant China had started perfectly in the Tokyo weightlifting competition as they sought to once again top the medal standings, as they had done in all editions since 2000, winning five gold medals at each Games between then and Rio 2016. Chanu, the only weightlifter from India taking part in the Tokyo Games, won only the second ever Olympic weightlifting medal for her country after Karnam Malleswari, who won bronze back in 2000. Tokyo bronze medallist Aisah, born 11 June 2002, became the youngest weightlifting medallist at these Games aged 19 years 43 days. Finishing fifth, Nina Sterckx secured the best ever result by a female lifter from Belgium and sixth placed Montero gave Cuba their best ever female weightlifting finish. Also participating in this event was Dika Toua from Papua New Guinea who, after missing the 2016 Games, became, along with Japan’s Miyake, the first ever female weightlifter to compete in five Olympics. Both also equalled the participation record held by Imre Földi, Ingo Steinhöfel, and Ronny Weller.

Between them, they had won 15 of the last 16 World Championship medals in the event: Karsten was the 1999 champion, the 2002 runner-up, and the 2001 and 2003 bronze medalist, Rutschow-Stomporowski was the 2001 champion, the 1999 and 2003 runner-up, and the 2002 bronze medalist, and Neykova was the 2002 and 2003 champion and the 1999 bronze medalist. The only exception to this dominance was Russia’s Yuliya Levina, the 2001 runner-up, who was competing in the quadruple sculls in London, meaning that her nation was represented in the single sculls by Irina Fedotova instead. Karsten and Neykova had also won the 2001 and 2002 Princess Royal Challenge Cup at the Henley Royal Regatta respectively, with Rutschow-Stomporowski as the runner-up both times.
These three favorites all won their heats in the opening round, but it was the Czech Republic’s Mirka Knapková who posted the fastest time with an Olympic record. In the semi-finals, Rutschow-Stomporowski had the fastest time, defeating Knapková in the process, while Karsten won the other heat against Neykova, albeit by a margin of only 0.15 seconds. The final, however, was more spread out, and Rutschow-Stomporowski, Karsten, and Neykova finished with a little breathing room in that order, leaving the 2004 podium different from the 2000 one only in order. Knapková came in just over two seconds after Neykova, although over 6½ seconds ahead of New Zealand’s Sonia Waddell, the next finalist. It was perhaps a disappointment for the Czech sculler, but it would turn out to be an ephemeral one, as she would go on to win the World Championships in 2011 and an Olympic title in 2012.

They were expected to be challenged by Schmitt’s teammate, Missy Franklin, who was swimming an ambitious seven-event schedule in London. Franklin started the final fast, passing 50 metres under the world record split, but she could not hold that and Schmitt moved ahead by 100 metres. She continued to open up, winning the gold medal by almost two seconds over France’s Camille Muffat, bronze medalist in the 200 and 400 frees at the 2011 Worlds, and earlier the gold medalist in London in the 400 free. Australian Bronte Barratt, better known for her efforts in relays, won the bronze medal, beating Franklin by only 1/100th of a second. Pellegrini was never a factor for the medals and placed fifth.
This was Schmitt’s third medal of the London Olympics, after a silver in the 400 free behind Muffat and a bronze in the 4×100 free relay. She had also won a bronze in 2008 as part of the 4×200 relay.

Whitlock qualified for the final as top scorer with 15.800 and was closely followed by his compatriot Louis Smith on 15.700. Smith won silver in 2012 and Whitlock bronze, but at the 2015 World Championships the tables were turned as Whitlock won gold and Smith the silver. The 2014 World Championship bronze medallist, and third best qualifier after the two Britons, Cyril Tommasone of France, started off proceedings with a 15.600 and he held the lead until Alex Naddour of the US went into the lead with 15.700, but two routines later and Louis Smith took over as the new leader with an excellent 15.833. With Whitlock up number seven he knew what he had to do to assure himself of a medal - score more than 15.700 - and he certainly did that with a virtually flawless routine that netted him 15,966 and first place. The Russian Kuksenkov, who represented Ukraine in 2012, was the last man to go but he did not affect the medal positions and Britain were first and second as Whitlock won Britain’s second ever gymnastics gold, and his third medal of the Games.

Both Amos and Murphy made the final, along with Kenyans Emmanuel Korir, the 2017 NCAA Champion, and Ferguson Rotich, who had run 1:43.75 in the first round and 1:44.04 in the semi-finals. The final was led at a slow pace by Korir and Australian Peter Bol, with the first lap run in only 53.76, the slowest Olympic final opening lap since 1980.
Bol led at the bell with Korir on his shoulder, and the Aussie continued to lead through 600 metres as the pace quickened. Korir took the lead on the final turn and was never challenged in the straight to win the gold medal. Behind him Rotich, who had been boxed on the turn when Korir made his move, closed quickly to take silver and Poland’s Patryk Dobek, formerly mostly known as a 400 hurdler, came up for the bronze.

Indeed, in the opening round, it was these two nations who won their heats, although the Canadians, bronze medalists at the most recent Pan American Games, posted a faster time than the crew from the United States. The final was arguably the most exciting of the men’s rowing events: Canada and the United States were neck-and-neck for nearly the entire race with the Canadians, who had come second in both their round one and repêchage heats, edging out the Americans for the gold medal by a mere 0.42 seconds. Australia, meanwhile, the 1983 World bronze medalists, outperformed the New Zealanders and earned bronze.

The honor of Olympic victory that year went to the Canadians and three of them (Malcolm Howard, Andrew Byrnes, and Brian Price) returned in 2012 to defend their title. No one counted out the strong British team either, who had 1992 Olympic champion Greg Searle on the squad as well as the home advantage of thousands of cheering fans, including Princes William and Harry, along Eton Dorney.
Germany and the United States qualified for the final during the heats, but perhaps the biggest story was the disappointing performance of the Canadians, who were dead last in their heat with a time slower than all but one of the other seven teams. They redeemed themselves in the repechage, however, coming in second place with the third fastest time of the entire event and earning a place in the final alongside Great Britain, Netherlands, and Australia. The final was a tight race; although Germany held the lead throughout the duration, perhaps every team had a chance at reaching the podium during some point of the course. For a time it looked as if Britain might overtake Germany to earn its first gold medal of the day, but they were edged out by both the Germans and the Canadians, taking home bronze. A short time later, however, the nation earned its first victory of the Games when Helen Glover and Heather Stanning took first place in the women’s coxless pairs.

But then the Czechoslovakian jumper Josef Matouš surprised everybody with 80.5 m, the longest jump of the day to take over the lead. Kankkonen, jumping last of the 53 participants, missed his first jump and was a distant 29th after the first round.
In the second round, a young Norwegian, 22-year-old Torgeir Brandtzæg, who had made a poor first jump, surprised with an excellent 79 m-jump. Engan made another good jump at 78.5 m and took over the lead, since Matouš was not able to follow up his first round jump. Then Kankkonen made the best jump of the day, 80 m and with high style points, but he needed another good jump to be in contention for the gold medal. After round two Engan was in a clear lead with 224.4 points, Matouš in second 6.2, points behind and the consistent German Dieter Neuendorf in third place. Brandtzæg and Kankkonen advanced to fourth and fifth place with their good second jumps and were still among the contenders for the gold medal.
In the third round, Brandtzæg made another good jump of 78 m, improving his total points but was unable to catch Engan, who also improved after his best jump of the day, another 79 m jump with better style points than his first jump. Matouš and Neuendorf were not able to improve and stayed behind Brandtzæg. Kankkonen was the last to jump, and he needed a jump around 78 m to take the gold medal from Engan. The 24-year-old Finn, showing great competitive ability, produced a stylish 79 m-jump and could celebrate as an Olympic champion.

However, in the first run of the competition he made a major mistake and broke one of his brakes, losing precious seconds. The other British entry, John Cuthbert Moore, 1st Baron Brabazon of Tara, was also highly considered but fell off his sled at the Shuttlecock curve only 2 days before the Olympic event started, broke several ribs, and cut his face badly.  He did not start. With Northesk behind, the two American Heaton brothers could decide the title between them, with Jennison eventually taking the gold and  Jack the silver.

All boxers in this class, their names remain as answers to the trivia question of who lost to the eventual winner, one Cassius Marcellus Clay, Jr.. The original favorite in the event was either the Pole Pietrzykowski, who had won Olympic bronze in 1956 as a light-middleweight, and was already a three-time European champion (1955, 1957, 1959), or Shatkov, the 1956 Olympic gold medalist as a middleweight. But the American coaches touted Clay, a reed-thin 18-year-old with lightning-fast hands from Louisville, Kentucky, who stood 187 cm (6-3) tall, and would later grow into a large heavyweight. Clay had won the Chicago Golden Gloves title in 1959 and 1960, adding the 1960 AAU titles and Olympic Trials. In Rome, he won his first bout over Becaus by TKO, then won unanimous decisions over Shatkov and Madigan to advance to the final against Pietrzykowski. Pietrzykowski was a formidable opponent and had a slight lead after two rounds, but Clay, told by his seconds that he needed to knockout the Pole to win, pummeled him in the final round. Pietrzykowski stayed upright, but Clay had another unanimous decision and the gold medal.
Pietrzykowski would come back in 1964 to add a bronze medal in this class, and he won his fourth European title in 1963. Right after the Olympics, Clay turned professional, winning his first fight against Tunney Hunsaker. In 1964 he would win the world heavyweight title by defeating the Big Bear, Sonny Liston. Clay became one of the world’s most popular athletes. Handsome, he never failed to mention that fact, calling himself pretty, and he began reciting poetry, often before his bouts, and often predicting in which rounds he would knock out his opponent. “Float like a buttefly, sting like a bee, his hands can’t hit, what his eyes can’t see”, became his mantra.
After winning the world professional title, Clay adopted the Muslim faith and took the name Muhammad Ali, by which he would become forever after known. Ali claimed conscientious objection to the war in Vietnam and was stripped of his professional title by US authorities, stating “I ain’t got no quarrel with them Vietcong.” He fought the decision, eventually winning in the US Supreme Court, and then came back to boxing. In the early 1970s Ali had three epic bouts with the 1964 Olympic heavyweight gold medalist, Joe Frazier, winning the last two, including the final drama, The Thrilla in Manila, considered by many as the greatest heavyweight bout ever. Ali would eventually win the world heavyweight title three times, also defeating the 1968 gold medalist, George Foreman, and the 1976 light-heavyweight gold medalist, Leon Spinks, to do so. Sadly, like many boxers, he fought too long, and later suffered from Parkinson’s disease, probably from the effects of so many punches causing chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), which rendered the Louisville Lip silent. In 1996 he thrilled American sports fans when “The Greatest” overcame his shaking to light the Olympic torch at the Atlanta Opening Ceremony.

Rojas was unbeaten in the event going back to 2019 and had won the last two World Championships and the last two World Indoor titles.
In the final Rojas was the second jumper for the first three rounds and she settled things early with 15.41, breaking the Olympic record of 15.39, set by Françoise Mbango of Cameroon back in 2008. No one else was expected to get close to that mark. The next jumper was Portugal’s Patrícia Mamona, who set a national record with 14.91. Cuba’s Liadagmis Povea was in third after the first round with 14.70, a mark she would repeat in round two.
Over the next rounds there were minor changes in the lesser medal positions, as Spain’s Ana Peleteiro moved into third in round two with 14.77 and Jamaican Shanieka Ricketts responded in round four with 14.84 to move up to third. In the fourth round Mamona increased her hold on second by jumping 15.01, further improving the Portuguese best. Rojas showed her dominance in that round with another excellent jump, 15.25.
In round five, Peleteiro jumped 14.87 to move back into third, and that would hold for the bronze medal. Mamona would likewise maintain her second place and take silver.
In the final round, with a trailing wind of only +0.7 m/s, Rojas finally erased Kravets from the record book with a world record leap of 15.67. For Imperial devotees it was the first women’s triple jump over 51 feet at 51-5. Rojas had three marks over 15 metres, only the fifth time that had been done in a series.

At the victory ceremony, the Belgian officials found that they had no Canadian flag to display, so they raised the British flag instead.
Tommy Thomson’s victory marked a dramatic return from a near fatal accident in 1914.  When 14 years old, he stepped off a buggy onto a loaded shotgun, which discharged into the left side of his chest.  He underwent a four-hour emergency surgery, but survived.  After the Olympics, Thomson retired from competition, but he later became well known as a coach, first at Dartmouth, and then at West Virginia and the U.S. Naval Academy.

Based on those 2019 results, though, New Zealand and Australia had to be considered as the most notable favourites, having been gold and silver winners respectively, although Australia had made major changes since then, retaining only three rowers from that team. Potential factors also included the third and fourth place finishers in 2019, the United States and Canada, as well as China, winners at the final Olympic qualifying regatta.
New Zealand and the United States went through to the finals following the heats, being joined there by Romania, Canada, China, and Australia via the repêchage. In the final, Canada went right out to the lead first, setting a faster pace than they had shown in the heats, with Australia and New Zealand following close behind. Canada continued to lead with New Zealand now her closest pursuer. Although the fast start strategy had not worked to Canada’s advantage at the 2016 Olympics, where they eventually faded to fifth, this year’s Olympics were a different matter altogether, as they led from start to finish to win their first Olympic gold in this event since the 1992 Games. New Zealand held on to second for the silver, while China made a strong closing sprint to wrest the bronze medal from the United States.

The points were based on 30% for Compulsory Figures, 20% for the Short Program, and 50% for Free Skating, with the tiebreaker for each judge being the Free Skating score.  Final placement was determined by a Majority Placement rule.  Thus, if a skater was ranked first by a majority of the judges, that skater was placed first overall, and the process was repeated for each place.  Ties were broken by a Subsequent Majority rule, i.e., if the skaters were ranked for the same position by the same number of judges, Majority Placement for the next higher position for each skater determined who was ranked higher.  The tiebreakers were then 1) Number of Majority Placements, 2) Total Ordinals of Majority, 3) Total Ordinals, 4) Total Points.",na,"The competition was expected to come down to the artistic John Curry (GBR) against the powerful athleticism of the Soviet’s Vladimir Kovalyov. Prior to 1976, Curry had never defeated Kovalyov in a major event, but shortly before the Innsbruck Olympics, Curry won the European Championships, with Kovalyov second. European judges’ criticism of Curry’s skating was that it was too feminine and not athletic enough. By the time of the Olympics, Curry had supplemented his programs with enough jumps to satisfy the judges. In the competition, Sergey Volkov (URS) took the lead after the compulsories with Curry second and Kovalyov third. Curry then moved into the lead, placing second in the short program to Canada’s Toller Cranston. Kovalyov had problems in the short, placing only sixth, and dropping to fourth place overall, behind Curry, Volkov, and East Germany’s Jan Hoffmann. Curry won the free skating to secure the gold medal. Kovalyov placed only fourth in that phase but moved up to the silver medal as Volkov and Hoffmann struggled. Cranston, fifth after the short program, placed second in the free skate to win the bronze medal. Curry was an openly gay skater, as was Cranston, and would later die from AIDS in 1994. American Terry Kubicka performed a back flip, then still allowed and the first at the Winter Olympics, but he was not rewarded by the judges. Curry was coached by Carlo Fassi, who also coached the 1976 women’s gold medalist, Dorothy Hamill.

Van Zo Post actually had no Cuban background, but his two Cuban teammates, Ramón Fonst and Manuel Díaz, had strong American connections. In 1904 Díaz was a student at Harvard College, while Fonst frequently competed in the United States, although he had grown up in France. This mixed team easily defeated the US team, 7-2, in the only match in this event. The individual bout scores are not known.
This event was originally scheduled for 6 September and it was expected that two teams would enter, one of fencers from New York and the other from Chicago, but the Chicago fencers did not arrive. The organizers initially awarded the title by forfeit to the New York team of Charles Tatham, Van Zo Post, Fitzhugh Townsend, and Scott O’Connor but they refused, stating they did not come to win prizes but to promote fencing in this section of the country, and they asked that the event be postponed to allow the Chicago team time to arrive. A large crowd had come to see fencing and applauded this show of sportsmanship by the New York fencers. The New York fencers then gave several exhibition bouts of fencing for the spectators. The event was re-scheduled for 8 September and was finally held on that date. A Chicago team had still not arrived and so a “New York” team, which included Arthur Fox of the Chicago Athletic Association, competed against the mixed US-Cuban team.

It is common for the host country to compete in all Olympic team sports, but Greece had no history in field hockey, and the International Hockey Federation (FIH) required them to qualify through normal ways. When they failed to place for the qualification tournament, they were given a second chance in a play-off series against Canada, which they lost 2-0. Now, the Greeks appealled to the Court of Arbitration for Sport, which ruled in favor of the FIH.
The three top countries of the 2002 World Championships in Kuala Lumpur - Germany, Australia and Netherlands - all qualified from their pool matches in Athens. The semi-final line-up was completed by Spain, 11th in Malaysia, and as in 1996, performing much better at the Olympics. The defending World Champions were toppled by the Dutch (3-2), while the Australians overpowered Spain 6-3. Since the Dutch had gone undefeated in their pool and beaten Australia, they were the slight favorites, and looking for a third consecutive gold medal. They were coached by Australian Terry Walsh, a silver medallist himself in 1976. Although the Australian hockey women had been very successful, the men had never won Olympic gold despite reaching three finals and winning five medals.
The final was a close affair. The Dutch squad took the lead through cousins Matthijs (assist) and Ronald Brouwer (goal). The Australians responded with a second half offensive, resulting in the equalizer by Travis Brooks in the 37th minute. Australia had the best opportunities for the winning goal in the remaining time, but the score remained 1-1. A sudden death (or “golden goal”) overtime followed. After 8 minutes, Australia won a penalty corner. The shot was fumbled, but Australia’s star player Jamie Dwyer picked it up to clinch the gold. Later that year he would receive the FIH’s World Hockey Player of the Year award.

In the final Hall led on the butterfly opener, his best stroke, trailed by Hungary’s András Hargitay, but he was almost three bodylengths behind. On the backstroke, Hall opened up further, leaving Hargitay a full three bodylengths in arrears, with Larsson half-a-lap behind, but Larsson’s best stroke was the breaststroke and it was Hall’s worst. Hall was tiring and American Tim McKee caught him at 275 metres, moving into the lead. Hall still led Larsson after 300 metres but he was visibly tiring and Larsson moved ahead of both McKee and Hall at 325 metres. The final was too close to call so the fans looked to the electric timing. Both Larsson and McKee had finished in 4:31.98, a seeming tie.
But the electric timer could measure to the 1/1000ths of a second and when that was done, Larsson had the gold medal – 4:31.981 to 4:31.983. Thousandth second timing was used at the 1973 World Championships, but this would not be allowed again, as it was shown that this was less than the thickness of one coat of paint on the wall, and minute differences in the lanes could affect this result. All future international swimming races after 1973 would be decided only to the 1/100th of a second, and if swimmers were tied at that margin, they were declared tied.

The other half of the draw was more predictable although the defeat of #2 seeds Russia by #3 seeds China would have been considered a minor upset if the recent form of both nations fencers were not taken into consideration.
The final saw Sun Yujie make up for the disappointment of failing to win the individual gold by anchoring China to victory by 39 points to 25.

At 20 km. the lead pack consisted of Gitsham, Broos, Hannes Kolehmainen, and Italy’s Ettore Blasi, with Estonia’s Jüri Lossmann and the Finn, Juho Tuomikoski, close behind.  Kolehmainen, winner of the 5 and 10K at Stockholm in 1912, took the lead at the midpoint of the race, and overall, he and Gitsham ran together for almost 15 kilometres.  Gitsham, however, was having problems with a leg injury and withdrew at around 37 kilometres.  Kolehmainen by then was pulling away for what appeared would be an easy victory, in what was the fastest time ever run for the marathon, even with the extra-long course.  However, Lossmann closed superbly and finished only about 13 seconds behind the Finn.  Lossmann later declared that had any of his Estonian teammates supported him, instead of going on an all day excursion, he would have won the race.  The third-place finisher, Valerio Arri of Italy, was so delighted with his bronze medal, that he performed three cartwheel somersaults as he crossed the finish line.
One of the Australian competitors, Wilfred Kent-Hughes wrote the following of Kolehmainen’s victory, “The winner could not rest his tired muscles.  They wrapped him in the flag of his country, placed a laurel wreath on his head, and forced him to make one more round of the track.  Kolehmainen ran round tiredly, in his fantastic ‘costume’ and reminded one of a Greek god who, dressed in a Roman toga, had just flown down from Olympus.  The crowd wildly cheered him, and the fanatic sports lovers passed him from hand to hand. It’s surprising he ever managed to survive the great ‘honour.’”

Each nation was allowed a maximum of four competitors.  Not strictly a true “3-Day Event” as we now know it, the event was termed the “Military Riding Competition” in 1912.  In addition, it took place over four days, not three.  Section scores were calculated by using the percentage of possible scores in each section multipled by 10.  The maximum by sections were the following:  Section 1 - long-distance ride of 55 km., maximum 10 points; Section 2 - 5 km. cross-country ride with natural obstacles of fences, ditches, and streams, held as a portion of the long-distance ride, maximum 130 points, scaled down to 10 points; Section 3 - 3,500 metre steeplechase, maximum 100 points, scaled down to 10 points; Section 4 - Jumping competition, maximum 150 points, scaled down to 10 points; and Section 5 - Dressage, maximum 770 points, scaled down to 10 points.  As an example, in dressage (section 5), Nordlander scored 590 in the dressage or .766 of maximum, which gave him a score of 7.66 for the dressage.
The event opened with the 55 km. ride on a day that was described as oppressively hot.  Still, 26 of the 27 riders finished the course, with only one (Albert Seigner [FRA]) outside the time limit of four hours.  In the cross-country portion of the ride, held concurrently, three riders rode the wrong way and were disqualified, but 13 posted perfect scores of 130.  Thus after two sections, 13 riders were tied for first place.  Two days later, 22 riders started the steeplechase section, but it did little to separate the logjam at the top.

This was his second Olympics, after competing at Tokyo in 1964, fully 44 years before Beijing. Hoketsu’s gap of 44 years between Olympic appearances was far more than the previous record of 32 years set by Mexican Eduardo Prieto, who competed in fencing in 1932 and sailing in 1964, and the mark of 28 years in the same sport, held by six Olympians.

Schenk had already set 15 world records in his career, and was World Champion in 1970-71 and European Champion in 1970 and 1972. The 1,500 was probably his best distance – he held the world record of 1:58.7, had won a silver medal at the 1968 Winter Olympics when he was still young, and was by 1972 rarely beaten in the event.
In the sixth pair, Norway’s Roar Grønvold and Sweden’s Göran Claeson moved into the 1-2 spots, finishing in 2:04.26 and 2:05.89 respectively. Grønvold had already won a silver in the 5,000 in Sapporo, and his time would earn him another silver, with Claeson holding on for the bronze. But then the king appeared two pairs later. Schenk started at a moderate pace, but was comfortably ahead at 1,100 metres and finished in 2:02.96 for his second gold medal in Sapporo.
Schenk would eventually win three gold medals in Sapporo, failing only in the 500, matching the feats of Clas Thunberg in 1924, Ivar Ballangrud in 1936, and Hjalmar Andersen in 1952. He turned professional after the 1972 Winter Olympics. In his career, Schenk set 18 world records, won eight major international tournaments, and his distance wins are too numerous to mention. Schenk was awarded the Oscar Mathisen Trophy in 1970, 1971, and 1972. He is considered one of the greatest speed skaters of all-time.

Yang’s sixth and last dive was a forward 4.5 somersaults, which scored him 102.5 points. Tom Daley had a disastrous start, scoring just 56.10 on his first dive after all seven judges awarded him a meagre 5.5, and he was out of the top 18 qualifying places in 23rd. He clawed himself back into contention, however, and finished as the fourth highest scoring qualifier. He was hoping to win his second gold medal of the Games, having won the synchronised platform title with Matty Lee.

Daley held the lead after his second and third dives with the Chinese divers alternatively occupying the silver and bronze medal positions. At the halfway stage, however, only 6.20 points separated the three men. The fourth round of dives was the one that effectively decided the outcome of the competition.
Daley made an error on entry into the water and slipped to third place while Cao went into the gold medal position. He held that lead going into the last round, and was 12.10 points of his fellow countryman. Yang’s final forward 4.5 somersaults with a degree of difficulty of 4.1, however, scored a massive 112.75 points to put pressure on Cao, who needed to score 100.65 to win.

This event rounded off another successful diving competition for China, who won their seventh gold medal out of the eight available, and for Cao he made history as the first diver to win Olympic gold medals in three different events. He won the platform synchro in 2012, springboard individual at Rio, and now the individual platform title. Daley won a medal in his third consecutive Games and also became the first Briton to win four diving medals.

Olij also departed at this stage, beaten by Argentina’s Arturo Rodríguez.  Rodríguez had fought as a light-heavyweight in Paris in 1924 without success but was an improved fighter in Amsterdam.  Rodríguez and Ramm met in the final, an excellent first round would be the deciding factor in the fight which meant that Argentina would win two boxing titles in the space of thirty minutes. Soon after the Games, Rodríguez retired from boxing but he was not lost to the world of sport; he was later to become captain of Argentina’s national rugby team.

France, Italy, and Great Britain were joined in the semi-finals by the surprising Uruguayans. Italy was led by the 1947 World Champion in the individual pursuit, Arnaldo Benfenati, while Uruguay’s team was led by Attilio François, who had lost to Benfenati in the 1947 final. In the first semi, France defeated Britain by just under five seconds. The second semi was no closer, Italy winning by almost six seconds, and the two favorites made it thru to the final.
In the final, the Italians got off quickly, leading by two lengths after three laps, and four lengths after seven laps. But France ground them down near the finish, and overtook Italy with two laps remaining, despite dropping a rider. But the Italians had nothing left, and two of their riders went off the back. As the time in the team pursuit is taken when the third rider crosses the line, France won by almost 40 seconds. For the third consecutive Olympics, the team pursuit podium consisted of France, Italy, and Great Britain. For the British, it was their fourth consecutive bronze medal in the event, and they would continue this streak in 1952 and 1956.
The French were led by Charles Costé, who would later win Paris-Limoges in 1953 as a professional. Another teammate, Serge Blusson, won the amateur race, Paris-Evreux, in 1949, then as a professional, won the Grand Prix de Plouay in 1953, the Tour de Picardie in 1957, and finished third at Milan-San Remo in 1952.

South Korea emerged from the qualifying round in superb shape having destroyed the existing world best and looked in fine form as they dispatched Ukraine in the last eight.
Things changed drastically in the semi-finals and an unusually subdued performance saw Korea exit at the hands of the US team. The other semi-final was a close affair with Italy, who had trailed Mexico throughout, edging through on the last three arrows. The final followed a different pattern and it was the Italian team who held a four-point lead at the halfway mark. America then slowly ground down that lead and one arrow to go the gold medal was still in the balance. To win the title the tubby, bearded Italian anchor-man Michele Frangilli had to finish with a perfect 10.

Canada took charge of the final and won its second Olympic canoeing title since 1936 (its first having come the day before from Larry Cain in the C-1 500) by a comfortable margin. The next two podium finishers were more of a surprise, as runner-up France’s crew of Bernard Brégeon and Patrick Lefoulon had only advanced to the semi-finals through the repêchage, while Australians Barry Kelly and Grant Kenny had not been considered medal contenders.

In 1951, he had also broken the world record and lowered it to 8.07,3. In January 1952, that time had been bested by Nikolay Mamonov, who had used 8.03,7 at the Kazakh Championships held at Medeo. But that time would not be officially recognized as a world record until 1955, and Mamonov did not compete in Oslo either.
With a light freeze, the ice conditions in Bislett were excellent. Andersen, departing in the third pair against Wim van der Voort, started eagerly. In a clean race with slightly increasing lap times, Andersen set a time of 8.10,6 just seconds away from his own world record, but beating both the track and Olympic record. The gold medal seemed secured already for Andersen.
At the recent European Championships, Andersen had won the 5,000 m by some 13 seconds over Kees Broekman and Kornél Pajor. Pajor was not allowed to compete in Oslo, but Broekman was. Starting two pairs after Andersen, it was immediately clear that he would not threaten the leader. A steady race left Broekman exactly 11 seconds behind first place. Several other medal candidates were still to come after Broekman. At the pre-Olympic Hamar competition, Pentti Lammio had finished second behind Broekman, while Sverre Haugli was disqualified there; he had finished second behind Andersen at the Norwegian Championships. Haugli skated first, and was faster than the Dutch skater for much of the race. Their split times in the last part of the race were close, and Haugli only lost the silver medal in the last lap, finishing 8 tenths behind Broekman. Lammio then had a similarly fast start, but blew up in the remaining laps. Of the remaining skaters, Anton Huiskes (Netherlands) was the only one to beat 8.30, but he finished well clear of the medals. The silver medal won by his team mate Broekman was the first Dutch speed skating medal won at the Olympics.

And in heat one, they lost all chances when the final exchange between Torri Edwards and Lauryn Williams was botched and they dropped the baton. Jamaica won the second heat easily and was thought to have a virtual walkover for the final, especially with the US out. The East German world record of 41.37 from 1985 was thought to be threatened.

Sacchi was World Champion in 1951 and would win the world title later in 1952 as well. For the first time since 1928, all matches were only a single race, rather than racing the medal rounds as best two of three. Twenty-seven cyclists came to the line in the first round. There were eight first round heats and four repêchages to qualify 12 riders for four quarter-finals. The second quarter-final repêchage had four competitors – Antonio Giménez, Béla Szekeres, Stéphan Martens, and Franck le Normand. Giménez led on the last turn when le Normand attempted to come around the pack, only to catch the rear wheel of Martens, with both of them going to the track. A re-race was ordered but le Normand could not compete and was taken to the hospital. Martens did start the re-race but could not put up much a battle, as the race was won by Giménez.
Two semi-finals qualified Sacchi and Australia’s Lionel Cox for the final. Werner Potzernheim (GER) also made the final via a repêchage after the semis. Sacchi won the final by what the 1952 Official Report termed a “narrow, but safe margin”. Cox placed second and the bronze went to Potzernheim. Potzernheim would again win sprint bronze at the 1954 World Championships. Sacchi turned professional after the Olympics, and competed until 1965. He never managed a professional world title, but in the sprint was second in 1953, third in 1954, and again second in 1958. Shortly after the final of the sprint, Cox teamed with Mockridge to win the tandem sprint gold medal.

Kim lost in the pool semis to Sweden’s Lars Adolfsson, which knocked Lascau out of the medals. Adolfsson lost the pool final to America’s Jason Morris, who faced Japan’s Hidehiko Yoshida in the final. Yoshida’s best international finish to date had been third at the 1991 World Championships, but he was dominant in Barcelona, winning all his preliminary matches by ippon. The final was no different, with Yoshida using uchi-mata for ippon over Morris at 3:35 to win the gold medal. Morris had been gold medalist at the 1987 and 1991 Pan-American Games. Kim Byeong-Ju won one bronze medal, while the other went to France’s Bertrand Damaisin, who defeated Adolfsson in their bronze medal match.

In the first semi-final the United States and Korea had established a lead, but a slip by Lee Ho-Seok took out both the Koreans and the US’ Eddy Alvarez This left the Netherlands - bronze medallists at the 2013 Worlds - and outsiders Kazakhstan to proceed comfortably to the final, although the United States were advanced to the final after the Koreans were disqualified. The second semi-final was no less dramatic when François Hamelin (CAN) slipped and crashed out of the race. Whilst the Canadian team continued they were well outside the pace. This left an intriguing race for the two final places with China leading for most of the race before being overtaken by a strong skate by Viktor An for Russia in the closing stages. China finished ahead of Italy to advance to the final.
The final started off in dramatic fashion when both China and the Netherlands fell on the first lap. This left for a strange race with Russia and the United States battling it out for the gold medal, Kazakhstan being some distance behind the two leading teams, but trying to hold off China and the Netherlands who had both re-joined the race. Some 10 laps to go saw the United States make their move for the gold medal, but they were unable to hold the lead. Meanwhile Kazakhstan had just about been overhauled by the other two nations, who would fight out the bronze medal. In the race for gold, Victor An took over on the final leg and the result never seemed in doubt, leading the Russians to the gold medal in a new Olympic record time of 6:42.100, ahead of the United States, with China pulling ahead to take the bronze medal. As part of the winning team Viktor An joined Apolo Anton Ohno (USA) in winning 8 Olympic medals, although 6 of An’s were gold medals as compared with Ohno’s 2.

At the beginning of 1912, Daniels also held the world record, having recorded 1:02.8 over 110 yards in New York on 15 April 1910.  But Daniels had recently retired and did not compete at Stockholm.  The favorite’s role in Stockholm probably fell to the German, Kurt Bretting, who on 6 April 1912, had broken Daniels’ world record with a mark of 1:02.4.
The Americans were led by the little known Hawaiian, Duke Kahanamoku.  Kahanamoku had not competed in the American championships, because he was so far from the mainland in an era when travel was not easy, but supposedly he had set record times in his native Hawaii.
Controversy occurred in the semi-finals, which were scheduled for the evening of 7 July, only a few hours after the quarter-finals.  For some reason, the American contingent, Kahanamoku, Ken Huszagh, and Perry McGillivray, who had all qualified for the semi-finals, did not appear, thinking that the afternoon race had qualified them for the final, to be held on 9 July.  But this was not the case.
The swimming officials made allowances, however, and decided to hold an extra heat among the Americans and Italy’s Mario Massa, who had missed the quarter-finals due to a “misunderstanding.”  They ruled that the winner of the extra semi-final heat could advance to the final, if he posted a time faster than the 3rd-place swimmer in heat one. Cecil Healy argued on behalf of the Americans and assisted in their successful appeal to be able to swim an extra qualification race.  Kahanamoku proved his ability in this heat, and made certain that he would qualify by giving his best effort, which resulted in his equalling Bretting’s world record of 1:02.4.  Huszagh was also advanced to the final, as his mark of 1:06.2 was equal to the 3rd-place time from heat one, which had been posted by Australia’s Bill Longworth.
In the final, Kahanamoku took the lead early, and Bretting never challenged.  Noting at the halfway mark that he had a comfortable lead, Kahanamoku eased up and still defeated Healy by almost two metres, although with a slower time than he had posted in the semi-finals.

Not only had he beaten Johann Olav Koss’s world record, set in the 1994 Olympics, he had also won two of the three World Cup races that year, the third one being won by Kjell Storelid, runner-up in 1994. In Nagano, Romme was mostly expected to battle his own teammates (Rintje Ritsma and Bob De Jong), and his former compatriot, Bart Veldkamp.
Veldkamp was the first of the favorites to skate. Olympic Champion for the Netherlands in 1992, he had assumed Belgian nationality to avoid the tough Dutch selection races and automatically qualify for international competition. In Nagano, Veldkamp broke Romme’s world record, becoming the first person to go below 6:30 with 6:28.31. The next pair included the reigning World Champion, Rintje Ritsma. He started out faster than Veldkamp, gaining more than a second, but lost ground towards the end, finishing with only 0.07 seconds left on the Belgian.
Ritsma’s time was still on top as the final pair with Romme and Storelid got underway. Romme set out with an insane pace, having a 2-seconds lead on Ritsma after only 1,000 m. Romme managed to keep up the pace, and eventually outraced Ritsma by a full six seconds, eight seconds below his own former best, shattering the previous world record. Just a month later, Romme would again shave off 8 tenths from his mark at the World Single Distance Championships in Calgary.

He was a superb athlete, also one of the best in the United States on the trampoline. On 28 June 1963 he was practicing on the trampoline doing a double-back with a full twist, a simple maneuver for him. But he landed badly, breaking his neck and was rendered quadriplegic. He would never vault, or walk again, though he lived until May 2013.
With Sternberg out, the favorites for Tokyo were Pennel and a vaulter who came on in 1964, Fred Hansen. Hansen set three world records in June-July 1964. He was AAU Champion in 1964 and won the Olympic Trials. Pennel injured his back shortly before the Olympics and would finish only 11th. In the final the competition came down to Hansen and three Germans, Wolfgang Reinhardt, Klaus Lehnertz (both FRG), and Manfred Preußger (GDR). All four cleared five metres on their first attempts. Hansen passed 5.05, while Reinhardt went over on his first try, with Lehnertz and Preußger failing at that height. Thus the gold medal was Reinhardt’s unless Hansen could outjump him at 5.10 (16-8¾). And he did, clearing 5.10 (16-8¾) on his third try while the German missed all three attempts.

The shorter parallel slalom race from Sochi 2014 was dropped to add in the big air to the Olympic programme.
Favorites for podium spots included two-time Sochi 2014 Olympic champion Russia’s (OAR’s) Vic Wild, Switzerland’s Nevin Galmarini, and Slovenia’s Žan Košir, The trio won gold, silver, and bronze respectively four years previous.  Wild’s two gold medals at Sochi 2014 (parallel slalom,  parallel giant slalom) marked the first time a snowboarder had won two medals at the same Olympic Winter Games. Reigning World champion Andreas Prommegger of Austria, 37, was also a threat.
The top three qualifiers leading to the final were Galmarina, Košir and Lee Sang-Ho (KOR), while Wild qualified in ninth out of the 16 racers to advance. In the straight elimination finals of 16, Wild was beaten by 2015 World champion and five-time Olympian Roland Fischnaller of Italy.  During the semifinals, Košir appeared to beat Lee in a dramatic finish, but officials declared that the home-crowd favorite South Korean had won by .01 seconds, even though replays of the finish showed that Košir appeared to have gotten his arm across the finish line before Lee did. The result stood and Košir went on to win the bronze finishing 1.49 seconds clear of France’s Sylvain Dufour.
In the final Galmarini, the silver medalist at Sochi 2014, finished 0.43 seconds ahead of Lee, winning his second career Olympic medal. In winning silver, Lee had captured his country’s first Olympic snowboarding medal. Following Galmarini’s victory, Switzerland had now won three of the five gold medals since the Winter Olympics introduced giant slalom snowboarding in 2002.

During the war Swedish skiers had developed new training methods to increase their stamina, and changed their technique, giving more importance to the diagonal style. They had also developed a new type of ski wax, the famous brand Swix. At the Holmenkollen competition in 1947, Nils Karlsson won the 18 km. race, followed by three countrymen and two Finns, with the best Norwegian placing seventh, almost four minutes behind the winner.
Karlsson was regarded as the favorite, but after a fast opening section he struggled with the thin air and finished in fifth place, last among the Swedes, save for the Nordic combined entrants. Martin Lundström, a 29-year old from Umeå, had his international breakthrough and won comfortably ahead of Nils Östensson and Gunnar Eriksson. The winner of the Nordic Combined, Heikki Hasu (FIN), was the only skier able to split the Swedish quartet, beating Karlsson by 11 seconds for fourth place. For the Norwegians, the event was a great disappointment. Their best skier, Olav Hagen, came in ninth, beaten by Lundström by over five minutes.
Before 1948, Lundström had been unable to win a Swedish Championship, but this was his great year. Later in the season he won the Holmenkollen 18 km. race followed by four more Swedes, and he would also claim three Swedish titles – 18 km., 30 km. and as a member of his club’s relay team.

He was also the 2017 world champion and the 2019 runner-up, behind his compatriot Brandon Loupos, who had been injured at the 2021 Worlds. The expectations were well-warranted, as he won the seeding round with ease and was comfortably ahead of the pack in his first run in the final, scoring a 93.30 that no one could best.
Daniel Dhers of Venezuela, the reigning Pan American champion, however, came close. Although he was third in the seeding round, behind home audience favorite Rimu Nakamura, he put on an excellent show in the second run of the finals to score 92.05 and take home the silver medal. Nakamura, on the other hand, struggled in the final and thus bronze went to Great Britain’s Declan Brooks, who had also taken bronze at the 2019 European Championships. His performance just edged out that of Kenneth Tencio of Costa Rica, 90.80 to 90.50.

Originally the leaders in this style of figure skating were the British. British couples had won the Worlds from 1952-60 and again in 1966-69. But by 1976, the greatest dance couple was the Soviet team of Lyudmila Pakhomova, a former pairs skater who had competed in that event at the 1966 Europeans, and Aleksandr Gorshkov. They were World Champions in 1970-74 and European Champions in 1970-71, and 1973-76, losing only at the Europeans in 1972 (their only loss between 1970-76), as they did not compete at the 1975 Worlds when Gorshkov was ill. They were expected to be challenged by their teammates, Irina Moiseyeva and Andrey Minenkov, the 1975 World Champions. But it was not close. Pakhomova/Gorshkov won all three phases of the competition and were ranked first by all nine judges, with their teammates winning the silver medal.

Australia’s Drew Ginn and Duncan Free, the 2006 and 2007 World Champions, probably had a slight advantage, as Ginn was also one of the defending Olympic champions. Also in contention were New Zealand’s Nathan Twaddle and George Bridgewater, the 2005 World Champions and 2006 and 2007 runners-up, and South Africa’s Shaun Keeling and Ramon di Clemente, the 2008 winners of the Silver Goblets & Nickalls’ Challenge Cup at the Henley Royal Regatta. Di Clemente had, with Donnie Cech, also been the 2002 and 2005 World runner-up, the 2001 and 2003 bronze medalist, the 2004 Olympic bronze medalist, and the 2004, 2005, and 2007 winner of the Silver Goblets & Nickalls’ Challenge Cup. Great Britain had won the 2006 Silver Goblets & Nickalls’ Challenge Cup and a bronze medal at the 2007 World Championships, and sent Robin Bourne-Taylor and Tom Solesbury to the 2008 Games. Finally, Canada was the reigning Pan American champion and the 2006 World bronze medalist, and was represented in Beijing by Dave Calder and Scott Frandsen. The only exception to the recent English-speaking dominance of this event was Croatia, whose brothers Siniša and Nikša Skelin were the reigning Olympic silver medalists.
The Australians posted the fastest time in the opening round, but were only half a second ahead of New Zealand, another heat winner. Meanwhile, both the French duo of Erwan Peron and Laurent Cadot and the Italian pair of Giuseppe De Vita and Raffaello Leonardo bested the Canadians in their heat. With different lineups, Italy had been the 2005 World and 2007 European bronze medalists. Canada turned the tables in the semi-finals, however, by recording the fastest time of the round, while the Australians won their heat only 0.27 seconds slower. France, Croatia, and Italy were all eliminated in this round and joined Great Britain, who had failed to advance in the repêchage. The qualification of the American Winklevoss twins, Tyler and Cameron (who helped found ConnectU, the forerunner of Facebook), meant that only one non-English speaking crew, the Germans Tom Lehmann and Felix Drahotta, would compete in the medal round. The final, however, was somewhat anti-climactic, and Australia, Canada, and New Zealand finished in that order with room to breathe.

The 2011 World Champion was Norwegian Alexander Dale Oen, who had won a silver medal in this event in 2008. Training in Flagstaff, Arizona in April 2012, Oen collapsed in his shower after a morning swim, and died later that day. The swimming world mourned the loss of the popular Norwegian who would have been favored in London in the 100 breast.
But something was back in two-time defending champion Kosuke Kitajima of Japan, and another surprise returnee was American Brendan Hansen. Hansen had competed at the 2004 and 2008 Olympics, but had always struggled to defeat Kitajima and had won silver in this event in 2004 and placed fourth in 2008. He retired after the 2008 Olympics, with two relay gold medals but no individual golds, and that gnawed at him. He returned to the water in 2011 attempting to fill that one hole in his swimming résumé, and won the US titles in the 100 and 200 breast in 2011 and qualified for the 2012 US Olympic team.
Both Kitajima and Hansen made the final as did Australian Brenton Rickard, who had set the world record of 58.58 in 2009. Also in the final was Italy’s Fabio Scozzoli, second to Oen at the 2011 Worlds, and South African Cameron van der Burgh, who had won bronze medals at the 2011 Worlds in both the 50 and 100 breaststroke events. Kitajima started the final in the early lead but had nothing left, was only fifth at the wall, and would finish fifth. Van der Burgh blasted to 27.07 at the wall, more than ½-second ahead of Rickard’s world record split, and would maintain that to win in a world record 58.46. The silver went to Australian Christian Sprenger, while Hansen finished third for the bronze medal, despite swimming in lane eight. Rickard placed sixth with Scozzoli seventh.
After he finished, van der Burgh gave a skyward salute, paying homage to his close friend, Alexander Dale Oen.

Flavius Koczi of Romania, the reigning European Champion and the 2009 world runner-up, was a potential medal favorite, but no one was seen as a true obstacle on the South Korean’s path to the Olympic crown. In the qualification round, however, Denis Ablyazin of Russia, bronze medalist in the vault at the most recent European Championships and the floor exercise at the London Games, posted the highest score, with 16.366 to Yang’s 16.333. Enrique González of Chile, who had already made history by placing fourth in the floor exercises in his country’s first appearance in Olympic gymnastics, finished a surprising third in the qualifications.
Koczi went first in the final, suffering penalties and finishing with a score of 15.633, which would not have been sufficient to qualify in the earlier round. It was not until halfway through the competition that a true bar was set by Ihor Radivilov of Ukraine, the 2012 European runner-up, with a total of 16.316. He was surpassed by Ablyazin, who posted 16.399, while González slid into third place with 16.183. Yang was the final gymnast and he chose the highest-difficult vault of the competition, 7.400, for his opener, but stepped forwards on his landing and received a low execution score of 9.066. His score for the first was still 16.466, however, higher than any other. Now in a good position to win gold, he eased the difficulty of his second vault down to 7.000, but performed it with sterling execution and earned a score of 16.600, more than enough to become South Korea’s first Olympic gymnastics champion.

Russia, always a very strong team, competed under the title of the Russian Olympic Committee (ROC), with quickly improving teams from Turkey and the Dominican Republic and Japan, the hosts of the competition making up the rest of the field.
The results of the competition in Group A could be called predictable, if not for one surprise. Japan lost the match to the Republic of Korea in a stubbornly contested match and left the tournament, having won only one game against the outsiders of Kenya. In Group B, a surprise also occurred, as the champion of the Olympic Games in Rio, the third ranked Chinese national team, did not progress from the group. Afterwards, vents developed predictably, except for a close Korea-Turkey quarter final, which Korea won only narrowly in the deciding tie break set. In the semifinals there were routine wins for the USA and Brazil, the leaders in the world rankings.
Before the semifinals, it was reported that Brazilian national team athlete Tandara Caixeta had tested positive for the drug Ostarine and was provisionally suspended from the rest of the competition. It was a major blow for the Brazilian team, and they were comfortably defeated in the final. Serbia won the bronze medal. The United States women’s team won Olympic gold for the first time with Brazil’s silver and Serbia’s bronze also being the first time those teams have won medals of that colour.

After all, Jung had won the last three European Championships, was world ranked at number one and was the holder of all three of the sport’s Grand Slam events. The only title Jung did not hold was that of the 2014 World Equestrian Games where he won silver behind compatriot Sandra Auffarth.
Jung was fifth after the dressage with William Fox-Pitt (GBR) leading the field ahead of Australia’s Christopher Burton. Fox-Pitt had only just recovered from a serious head injury suffered in an event in France in October 2015 which left him in a coma for two weeks. The Briton’s chance of a fairy tale victory was lost with a refusal on the cross-country phase. The leaders after the cross-country were the only three combinations to have ridden clear and inside the time limit. Burton led the field ahead of Jung and Astier Nicolas of France, with 1984 and 1988 champion Mark Todd of New Zealand just behind them and threatening to win a medal at age 60. Sadly for Todd, a nightmare first round of jumping removed him from contention and Burton also suffered disappointment as he dropped from first to third.
In the final phase of jumping Phillip Dutton of the USA produced a clear round which meant that he overtook Burton and won his first Olympic medal for 16 years - but the gold was to be decided between Jung and Nicolas. First up was Nicolas who hit a rail down and was marginally over the time allowed as well. This meant Jung would win as long as he did not have two fences down – something that never looked like happening. At the 2012 London Games, Jung became the first gold medallist to finish an Olympic eventing competition on his dressage score. They repeated that performance in Brazil with another perfect round in the final show jumping phase.

Bragg was joined on the US team by outsiders Lindy Remigino and Dean Smith. Their biggest opposition was felt to come from Jamaica’s Herb McKenley and Britain’s McDonald Bailey. The final in Helsinki is probably the closest mass finish in Olympic 100 metre history. Bragg did not make the final, but Smith, Remigino, McKenley, and Bailey were joined by Vladimir Sukharev of the USSR, and John Treloar of Australia. Remigino got out to an early lead but McKenley came on strong at the end and it was difficult to tell who had won. But McKenley’s fast finish saw him pass Remigino in the metres after the line, leading many observers to think the Jamaican had won. The photo finish was necessary to separate the runners, with Remigino winning gold, McKenley silver, and Bailey bronze. Smith, Sukharyev, and Treloar finished 4-6. The first four finishers were credited with 10.4 and Sukharyev and Treloar 10.5, but the auto times showed a margin of only 0.12 seconds between 1st (10.79) and last (10.91).

The works were limited to no more than 20,000 words, and editors could not submit any works.
The jury included eminent writers such as William Lyon Phelps, Thornton Savage, Hugh Walpole and André Maurois. The catalogue only indicated that 18 artists participated with 18 exhibits from eight countries, and does not mention the title of the writings submitted, because the submissions arrived so late in Los Angeles that they could no longer be included in the catalog. The jury also came together very late. It cannot be determined when the prizes were distributed.
An Honorable Mention went to Avery Brundage, and it can be assumed that the jury wished to reward the President of the US Amateur Athletic Union (AAU), and future IOC President. Brundage was a lifelong advocate of pure amateurism, which he described in his essay The Significance of Amateur Sport.
The gold medal was awarded to German adventurer and author Paul Bauer for The Struggle with the Himalaya. The Munich-based Bauer executed an expedition to Kangchenjunga in 1929, and climbed partway up the third-highest mountain on Earth, at 8,586 meters. The expedition reached 7,300 meters, followed in 1931 by a second expedition in which they reached the Ostsporn (7,756 meters). One mountaineer and one sherpa were seriously injured and died, while two other climbers died from diseases. Bauer had submitted eight chapters of the manuscript for his planned book titled On Kangchenjunga.
The silver medal went to Danish writer Josef Petersen for The Argonauts. Petersen wrote mostly about ancient and medieval motifs and was well-known for his knowledge of ancient cultures. He won all his Olympic art medals (1924, 1932 and 1948) with works on ancient Greek sports motifs. The example of his work submitted in Los Angeles was the Argonauts Saga, which appeared in book form in 1932. No bronze medal was awarded.

Søbak, with one missed target, took over the lead until East Germany’s Matthias Jacob, lying ninth after the first shooting, had a perfect series of shots and bettered Søbak’s time by seven seconds. Both the leader Šalna, and Mougel, missed twice and were behind Jacob and Søbak. Next of the favorites to the final set of targets was Kvalfoss. He missed one target and had to ski one penalty lap, but due to his skiing speed he took over the lead, four seconds ahead of Jacob. The last of the favorites to arrive was Angerer. With a perfect shooting round he could challenge Kvalfoss’ leading time, but he missed one target and left as third, only one second behind Jacob. Over the last 2.5 km Kvalfoss extended his lead to nine seconds and won Norway’s first Olympic biathlon gold in twelve years. Angerer was faster than Jacob in the final ski segment and won his second individual Olympic medal, and Jacob, having won two World Championships relay gold medals in 1981 and 1982, won his first individual Olympic medal by securing the bronze. Søbak and Šalna were nine and ten seconds too late, respectively, for a medal. Ullrich had to ski three penalty laps and was once again skiing far slower than normal, finishing a distant 17th, 1:47 behind the winner Kvalfoss.

Both men qualified for the medal pool in Montréal which turned out to be the most evenly matched in Olympic history. Three men, including Pusch, were tied with a record of 3 wins and 2 losses whilst the other three, which included Edling, had 2 wins and 3 losses. Pusch won matches in the tie-breaking barrage to win gold ahead of teammate Hans-Jürgen Hehn and the 1968 champion Győző Kulcsár of Hungary. If one ignores the 1906 Intercalated Games, Pusch was the first German male to win an Olympic fencing title.

In early 1896, however, as so aptly put by Montague Shearman, Bredin )voluntarily joined the professional ranks, a step which was received with great surprise, as he was a gentleman by birth and education).
The heats of the 400 metres were held on 6 April. The race was slightly over one lap in length, with no lanes to separate the runners. There were two heats with seven runners coming to the start. In heat one, Herbert Jamison (USA) won, defeating Fritz Hofmann and Kurt Doerry of Germany, trailed by France’s Alphonse Grisel. There was a false start in this heat, and Hofmann and Grisel were penalized two yards for their indiscretion. The second heat was won by the favorite, Tom Burke, who defeated Britain’s Charles Gmelin and Frantz Reichel of France.
The finals followed on the next day, 7 April. Burke won very easily, in 54.2, with Jamison trailing him by as much as 15 metres. Third-place is disputed in later sources, with some listing Gmelin and some Hofmann, but Gmelin definitely finished 3rd per 1896 sources.

On paper they looked formidable as Federer was the best player in the world, some saying the greatest of all-time, and Wawrinka was ranked #10 in singles, but Federer virtually never played doubles and was doing so at the Olympics only out of his loyalty to Switzerland, and the pair was only seeded #4. The Bryans were upset by the Swiss team in straight sets, after losing the first set tiebreaker.
Federer/Wawrinka advanced to the final to face the Swedish team of Simon Aspelin and Thomas Johansson, who were unseeded. And they had to be tired, having survived a marathon semi-final victory over France’s Arnaud Clément and Michaël Llodra, 7-6 (6), 4-6, 19-17. The final match was close, but Federer/Wawrinka prevailed in four sets, 6-3, 6-4, 6-7 (4), 6-3, to give Federer his first ever Olympic gold medal.

Akoyev was considered a co-favorite with Bulgarian Stefan Botev, the 1989-90 World Champion. Botev no longer wanted to represent Bulgaria as he had emigrated to Australia. However the Bulgarian weightlifting officials would not release Botev to compete for Australia and demanded that he compete at the 1992 Olympics for his native country. The same held true for Nicu Vlad, a Romanian who had won the 1984 Olympic middle-heavyweight gold medal and had also recently emigrated to Australia. He also could not get a release and competed in Barcelona for Romania. Vlad also wanted to compete as a heavyweight I but his qualifying mark had come in the heavyweight II class and he was forced to compete in this class, giving up 5 kg of bodyweight to his competitors.
Akoyev led the competition with 195.0 kg after the snatch, followed by Weller with 192.5 kg and Botev and Vlad with 190.0 kg. Vlad was unable to match the others in the clean & jerk and would finish fourth. Weller listed 240.0 kg in the clean & jerk to win the gold medal, with Akoyev taking silver and Botev bronze.
Weller and Botev would move up to the super-heavyweight division, winning silver and bronze medals at Atlanta in 1996, Botev while competing for Australia. Vlad would win a silver medal for Australia in this class at the 1994 World Championships.

The second seed went to Sweden’s Alex Kessidis, but he would lose his opening match to Azerbaijani Rafiq Hüseynov on a judges’ decision after they tied, 1-1.
Lőrincz would add Olympic gold to his palmarès but was far from dominant. He won in round one by a forfeit and then won his final three bouts by decision, all by margins of 1 or 2 points. In the final Lőrincz  faced Kyrgyzstan’s Akzhol Makhmudov, defeating him 2-1 in a dull match. One day later, Tamás Lőrincz’s brother Viktor would add a silver medal to the family trophy chest by placing second at 87 kg Greco-Roman.

When he finished in 7:12.28, far from Aleksandr Baranov’s world record of 6:45.66, and almost 10 seconds slower than Eric Heiden‘s Olympic record, he did not think the time would be good enough for the podium.

But he faded badly on the final two laps, barely finishing behind the Swede, in 7:12.30. Malkov’s pairmate, East German Andreas Ehrig, was also ahead of Gustafson’s pace at 4,200 metres, but was hardly able to finish the race, crossing in 7:17.63, his last lap almost four seconds slower than Gustafson’s. In the seventh pair, Ehrig’s East German teammate, René Schöfisch, skated more reasonably, and finished in 7:17.49, which would win him the bronze medal. This was completely unexpected, as previously he had only won the 1983 GDR 5 and 10k championships.  In the end, Gustafson watched the entire field take a crack at his time, but nobody bettered it and he had a gold medal.

It was designed in 1965 by Ian Proctor as a boat to be used in trials for a new Olympic keelboat class, and it won those trials convincingly. The Tempest was unusual for this era in that it has a trapeze, which is a wire attached to the top of the mast, to which a crew member can hook onto, and brace against the outside of the hull to help keep the boat flat. Prior to 1972, only the Flying Dutchman class at the Olympics had used a trapeze.
Racing on the Bravo course, the Ukrainian Soviet crew of Valentyn Mankin and Vitaliy Dyrdyra won the gold medal by coming from behind in the final race to best the British crew of Alan Warren and David Hunt. Mankin was one of the greatest Olympic sailors ever. He had won the gold medal in the Finn Class in 1968, and added a silver medal in Tempest in 1976 and gold in Star Class in 1980, winning four Olympic medals in four sailing appearances. This made him only the second Olympic sailor, with Denmark’s Paul Elvstrøm, to win Olympic medals at four consecutive Olympics, although all of Elvstrøm’s were gold.

Khamrsi exited the competition early, failing to lift her initial snatch weight of 81 kg within three tries, leaving the podium spots more open than ever. Wang was placed first following the snatch competition, with a final lift of 91 kg, four kilograms more than her closest competitor, Hiromi Miyake of Japan.

The exhibits for the two competitions “Town Planning” and “Architectural Design” were identical, but were assessed separately for both categories. Two works by Italian architects were shown “hors concours”. All six medals were awarded.
For the competition in Architectural Design the gold medal went to Dutch architect Jan Wils for Olympisch Stadion van Amsterdam (Olympic Stadium at Amsterdam). He was the only architect to win an Olympic medal with a design that was realized for the same Olympics. One of its notable features is the “Marathontoren” (Marathon gate), a 40 m high tower. Wils planned to have a fire burn on top of this tower throughout the Olympics. A traditional Greek symbol, the socialist Wils supposedly used fire to juxtapose his tower against church towers, as Dutch Christian politicians had been largely opposed to holding the “heathen” Olympics in the Netherlands.

His biggest challenge was expected to come from Kees Verkerk, who had won the distance and the all-around title at the 1966 and 1967 World Championships and the 1967 European Championship.
Verkerk was in the third pair, with no significant leading time to shoot at. He was ahead of world record pace throughout and finished in 7:23.2, surpassing Maier’s world record. Two pairs later Maier toed the line. He crept ahead of Verkerk’s pace at 1,800 m, and was three seconds clear at 3,800 metres. He then held on to finish in 7:22.4, re-taking the world record, which would secure for him the gold medal. In the 10th pair, the Netherlands’ Petrus Nottet finished in 7:25.5, also under the previous world record, a mark that brought him the bronze medal.
Maier had been around internationally since 1960, but 1968 was his greatest year. A distance specialist, he set seven world records, won both the European and World Championships, and the 5 and 10K at both tournaments, and won this Olympic gold medal. One day after this race, Verkerk would win the gold medal in the 1,500.

Three skiers later, unheralded Swiss skier Marie-Theres Nadig moved into first, a full second ahead of Corrock. But Pröll was still to come, the last off of the seeded skiers.

In addition to Fontana, Schulting, and Maliszewska, the fourth skater to win a 500 m World Cup earlier in the season was Canada’s Kim Boutin, also the 2018 bronze medalist.
There were no upsets in the heats, but the quarter-finals saw the surprise exit of 2018 World Champion Choi Min-Jeong. Boutin led most of the first semi-final. At the bell, Fontana displayed her form by overtaking the Canadian on the outside, winning by a clear margin. Boutin held on for second, beating Yelena Seryogina by half a blade. Schulting also impressed in her semi, opening a large gap right from the start and finishing unchallenged. Belgium’s Hanne Desmet seemed to hold on for second, but was tripped by Qu Chunyu and thus advanced to the final along with second-placed Zhang Yuting.
The final had some trouble getting underway. After a false start, the field got underway, with Schulting and Fontana battling it out for the lead. The Italian fell, but as this was within the first half lap, the race was restarted again. Despite Fontana starting from the inside lane, it was Schulting leading after the first curve. But unlike the semi-finals, she was unable to build out that advantage, with Fontana remaining closely behind. With 1½ laps to go, the Italian made a decisive pass on the inside of Schulting, and Fontana held on to retain the title she won in 2018, making her the third athlete with back-to-back wins in the event. For Fontana, it was her 10th Olympic medal in the sport, a record. With Schulting in second and Boutin in third, the podium was very similar to PyeongChang, with only Schulting taking her compatriot Yara van Kerkhof’s place in second.

His 13:30.55 had been unapproachable since, and had not yet been beaten, despite the introduction of the clap skate. Romme, the defending World Champion, had won the season’s only World Cup race, beating his competition by more than 15 seconds in Innsbruck. As in the 5,000 m, competition was mostly expected from the other Dutchmen, Rintje Ritsma and Bob De Jong, and a former Dutchman, Bart Veldkamp.
When Romme started his race, Kjell Storelid was the leader. His 13:35.95 had been his best time since the 1994 Olympics, when he had placed second behind Koss. But Romme obliterated the Norwegian’s time, beating it by 20 seconds, and Koss’s old record by 15 seconds for a new world best of 13:15.33. He completely overshadowed his pair mate, Bob de Jong, who also went below the old time with 13:25.76.
As the gold medal seemed secure in the hands of Romme, Ritsma and Veldkamp set out for the remaining medals in the final pair. Ritsma, having beaten Veldkamp by just 0.07 for the silver in the 5,000 m, set out the fastest, but Veldkamp slowly gained ground, and took the lead at 8,000 m. Ritsma fell more than a second behind, and his medal chances seemed lost until he regained himself and closed the gap in the final two laps to beat Veldkamp for the bronze medal. Thus, the Dutch swept the medals, the first time the Netherlands has done so at the Olympic Games. As in other distances, Romme’s World Record was not to last very long. He himself lowered it by another 7 seconds in March at the World Single Distance Championships.

Three sailors followed with 60 points each: France’s Charline Picon, eighth in 2012, but was subsequently the 2014 World Champion, PR China’s Chen Peina, who had a fantastic last day of the preliminaries winning three races, and Israel’s Maayan Davidovich, like Elfutina a solid performer. Only one point behind was Spain’s Marina Alabau, the gold medalist in London 2012, and another seven behind and obviously with a realistic chance of a medal was Lilian de Geus from the Netherlands. But the result of the medal race, with its doubling of points, changed everything.
Tartaglini and Davidovich placed only eighth and ninth dropping to seventh and eighth overall. De Geus, won the medal race and gained twelve points against Elfutina, who received 14 points for her seventh place and just held on to the bronze medal with just a one-point advantage. Alabau Neira’s fifth place was only good enough to consolidate her fifth place at the end of the preliminaries. The big winners of the medal race were Picon and Chen, with Picon’s second place giving her a total of 64 points which turned out to be good enough for gold. Chen, level with her after the preliminaries, moved forward from sixth to second place on the downwind leg, but had to give way to Picon and settle for silver, two points behind.

This was an unusual event as no skier was able to place in the top eight of both styles. The leader after the classical was Czech Lukáš Bauer. Back in 13th place was Norwegian Frode Estil, but he could be excused. He fell at the start and broke a ski, and by the time it was replaced, he was in last place of the 76 starters, but skied brilliantly from there and was only 3.7 seconds out of the lead at the finish. In the freestyle pursuit, the leader for most of the race was Italy’s Pietro Piller Cottrer, who had been third in the morning race.

Rybakov lifted 209.0 in the snatch, but when Lu apparently lifted 214 kg on his second attempt, he seemed to have the gold medal, tying Rybakov with 394.0 kg, but Lu weighed less than Rybakov. The Chinese officials started celebrating but the judges then ruled that the lift was not legal. Lu made his third attempt with the same weight and this time cleanly lifted 214.0 kg and the gold medal was his. Bronze went to Armenia’s Tigran V. Martirosyan, whose teammate and namesake, Tigran G.

But Leo Linkovesi of Finland had recently broken Keller’s world record with 38.0 in Davos in January 1972. And Ard Schenk was a mild threat. Schenk was the greatest all-around skater in the world, and was trying to win four gold medals in the four speed skating events, to duplicate the feat of Lidiya Skoblikova in 1964, but he was a longshot in the 500.
In the first pair Sweden’s Hasse Börjes posted an Olympic record of 39.69, which was considered a formidable time. But Keller bettered it in the third pair, finishing in 39.44, and these two would eventually win the gold and silver medals, as Keller defended his title. Muratov was in the next pairing and his 39.80 brought him the bronze medal. Schenk was in the fifth pair and although anticipation was high, he fell early and although he got and finished the race, he wound up in 34th place. Linkovesi skated next but his 40.14 earned him only sixth place.
Keller was one of the great sprinters of his era. In his career he would set four world records at 500 metres, one in the 1,000 m, and one in the sprint all-around. In addition to his two Olympic golds in this event, he won the distance at the 1968 and 1970 World Winter Universiade, the 1969-70 European Championships, and one race at the 1971 World Sprints.

Nielsen was back in fifth while Seebohm struggled and finished only sixth in the final. This was one of three individual gold medals for Hosszú, who also won both individual medleys.

Ties broken by lightest bodyweight.",na,"There was no clear favorite in this class as international competitions had produced several different winners in the last few years, and several of them had changed weight divisions. The leader after the press was American Jim George, who had won the bronze medal in the division at Melbourne. He continued to lead after the snatch, but narrowly over Poland’s Ireneusz Paliński, but Paliński outlifted George in the clean & jerk by 15 kg and won the gold medal comfortably, as George took silver. Bronze went to Paliński’s teammate, Jan Bochenek, who had always competed as a middleweight until the Rome Olympics.

9001025,"500 metres, Men",2018 Winter Olympics,60,Speed Skating,/editions/60/sports/SSK,19 February 2018 — 20:53,"Gangneung Oval, Gangneung Olympic Park, Coastal Cluster, Gangneung",36 from 17 countries,na,na,"Since the 2014 Olympics, the top 500 m skater had been Pavel Kulizhnikov. In both 2015 and 2016, he had won the 500 m world title, the World Sprint Championships and the 500 m World Cup. In addition, he had broken the 34-second barrier, setting a world record of 33.98 in November 2015. In 2016, he was suspended for use of the stimulant meldonium as one of many Russians to suffer that fate. His suspension was lifted as WADA acknowledged uncertainties about how long meldonium remains in the body. His 2016/2017 season, however, was negatively impacted by the affair, compounded by injury. He returned in the Olympic season, although not as dominant as before, but would not go to the Olympics. He was one of many Russian athletes barred from competed due to their doping history; Kulizhnikov had been disqualified from the World Junior Championships in 2012 after adverse analytical findings. Also missing from the field was fellow Russian Pavel Murashov, as well as the defending Olympic champion, Michel Mulder, who had failed to qualify for the Dutch team. With them out of the picture, the race was open. Four more riders had won World Cups in the running season: Håvard Holmefjord Lorentzen, Laurent Dubreuil, Alex Boisvert-Lacroix and Ronald Mulder, while 2017 World Champion and 2014 runner up Jan Smeekens was also considered a contender.
Most of the favorites, however, did not deliver in the race, leaving room for outsiders to mount the podium. Gao Tingyu, whose best World Cup result had been fifth, set the first competitive mark at 34.65. To the delight of the crowd, home skater Cha Min-Kyu bettered this mark with 34.42, also bettering the track record. Cha had been second in a World Cup earlier in the season, but had mostly featured further down the rankings. The only skater to surpass Gao and Cha was Lorentzen. The Norwegian, winner of three World Cup races during the season, managed to silence the Korean crowds, as he equalled his personal best mark of 34.41. A private video of his brother Håkon (professional football player for Sandeford) following the race and yelling him on later made the rounds on social media and television. The gold medal was the first in the event by a Norwegian since Finn Helgesen in 1948, while Gao was the first Chinese man to win a medal in Olympic speed skating.

The ranking round consisted of 72 arrows at 70 m.  Matches consisted of up to 5 sets of 3 arrows (at 70 m), winner was the first player to reach 6 points. In case of a tie, matches were decided with a single arrow, the one closest to the center winning the match. Final ranking for places 5-8 determined on number of set points won in quarter-finals, other competitors ranked by round of elimination.",na,"South Korea’s position as the supreme nation in women’s archery had been secure since the mid-80s but they suffered a major shock at the 2011 World Championships when they were frozen out of the individual medals and could only muster bronze in the team event. Despite that setback, Korea still had a strong team and Ki Bo-Bae was considered co-favourite with Deepika Kumari who was bidding to be the first Indian woman to an Olympic title.
The women’s qualifying round was a much closer affair than the men’s equivalent with three women level on 671. Ki Bo-Bae topped the standings after by scoring more tens than compatriot Lee Seong-Jin and Tan Ya-Ting of Taipei.
For the London Games the format of the knockout rounds had changed from the previous Olympics. In Beijing matches were decided over the cumulative score of 12 arrows but in 2012 matches consisted of up to 5 sets of 3 arrows (with 2 points to the winner of each set and 1 for a tie), winner was the first player to reach 6 points. In case of a tie, matches were decided with a single arrow, the one closest to the centre winning the match. In theory this should have for a more dramatic, albeit unpredictable, tournament than before.
The first knockout round saw the exit of out of form world champion Denisse van Lamoen of Chile and more notably of world number one Deepika Kumari who lost to Britain’s Amy Oliver. There were few further major shocks until the quarter-final stage and then only in the bottom half of the draw as the Mexican pairing of Aída Román and Mariana Avitia both beat higher seeded opponents to ensure that they faced each other in the semi-finals.  Román won and would then face Ki Bo-Bae in the gold medal match.  After the requisite 5 sets the two archers were level on 5 points apiece so for the first time in Olympic history the women’s title would be decided by a single arrow shoot-off.  Just as the shoot-off began a strong gust of wind blew up and neither woman could score better than an 8 but as Ki’s arrow was almost touching the gold sector she won the Olympic title. After her victory Ki burst into tears and apologised to the Korean nation for winning the gold by shooting an 8. “Koreans do not shoot eights” she said.
Avitia earned another medal for Mexico in the bronze medal match making the first time Mexico had won two medals in the same event since 1984. Although neither had particularly successful Games Natalia Valeeva of Italy and Great Britain’s Alison Williamson at least had the consolation of equalling the record for most appearances by an archer at the Olympic Games. For both it was their sixth Olympics.
