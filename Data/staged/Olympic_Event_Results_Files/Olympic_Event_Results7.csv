One double jump, one triple jump.  Average height - 1.1 to 1.2 metres.  One river jump 4 metres wide.",na,"The course for jumping was 850 metres in length, with 22 jumps, including one double jump, one triple jump, and one water jump of 4 metres in width. Very little is known about the competition in 1900, which was won by Belgium’s Aimé Haegeman, followed by his countryman Georges Van Der Poele, and France’s Louis de Champsavin. Press reports in 1900 list the medalists with times appearing to determine the placements, so presumably they either all rode cleanly, or tied on faults.

991,"5,000 metres, Men",1936 Winter Olympics,32,Speed Skating,/editions/32/sports/SSK,12 February 1936 — 10:15,"Olympia-Eissportplatz am Rießersee, Garmisch-Partenkirchen",37 from 16 countries,na,na,"The clear favorite for this event was Ivar Ballangrud, the 1928 champion. He had bettered the World Record in January (8:17.2), and had convincingly won the 5000 m at the recent World Championships. However, there were a few dangerous competitors. Austria’s Max Stiepl had beaten Ballangrud at the European Championships, clocking an impressive 8:20.7 along the way. Much was also expect of the US’s Eddie Schroeder, Finland’s Birger Wasenius. In his own team, Ballangrud could expect competition from Charles Mathiesen, with a season best of 8:20,2.
The early lead was taken by Antero Ojala, a 19-year-old unknown from Finland. Skating in good ice and weather conditions, none of the skaters could come close to his time, until Ballangrud took the ice. The Norwegian laid down a very “flat” race, and had the advantage of being able to skate towards his pairmate, Aleksander Mitt, who was nearly a lap behind at the finish. Ballangrud’s finishing time was just 2 seconds above the World Record. Three races later, the runner-up of the World Championships, Wasenius, took the ice against Jan Langedijk, of the Netherlands. They would be the fastest pair of the race. Birger Wasenius kept close to Ballangrud’s split times, but lost several seconds in the final laps, while Langedijk came equally close to Ojala’s third place time, but ended up in fourth. None of the remaining skaters came close, and Ballangrud collected his third Olympic gold medal, his second in the 5000 m.

The event was won by Malaysian-born American Jimmy Kim, which was the only victory in 1988 men’s taekwondo by a non-Korean athlete. Kim had been runner-up at the 1987 World Championships, and won the 1985 World Games and 1987 Pan American Games titles. In the final, Kim defeated Korea’s Kim Jong-Suk, who made it to the final by defeating German Michael Arndt, the 1987 World Champion, in the semi-finals.

The Japanese team applied a tactical approach to the final and put their fastest swimmer on the opening leg and held back their slowest man until the final leg. With the Americans choosing the more common approach of using their faster men over the last two legs, Japan took an early lead and then increased it over the second leg. Ford Konno  closed the gap on leg three but it was not until the final leg that the American team, in the form of Jimmy McLane  took the lead that they were to maintain to the finish. The battle for bronze mirrored the battle for gold with France overhauling Sweden in the latter stages.

Five bad points eliminated a wrestler.",na,"The two favorites were Sweden’s Axel Cadier and Latvian Edvīns Bietags, who had won the European Championships in 1935 and 1934, respectively. After three rounds in Berlin they were well ahead on bad points, and maintained that in rounds four-five, winning by falls and byes, to move into a final match against each other. The final went to Cadier by unanimous decision, with Bietags taking the silver medal. Bronze went to Estonian August Neo, who also won a silver medal in Berlin in light-heavyweight freestyle.
Fourth went to Herman Werner Seelenbinder, who went out after round five, when he lost a decision to Cadier. Seelenbinder was a fervent anti-Nazi and considered not competing in Berlin, but was persuaded to do so. The Nazi authorities did not trust him, either, but allowed him to compete because they expected him to win a medal. He was a member of the German Communist party, and the underground Uhrig Group, and in February 1942 was arrested and placed in various prison camps for two years, before being executed by beheading in October 1944.

Yuliya Nesterenko (BLR) was unheralded prior to the Olympics. In the first round, her 10.94 was a Belarussian national record. He was expected to be challenged in the final by Lauryn Williams (USA), who had won the 2005 World Championships and was NCAA Champion in 2006. Williams got off to a slow start in the final, but surged early and took the lead. At 80 metres Nesterenko caught her and pulled ahead to win in a close, but surprising finish. Nesterenko became the first female sprinter to run all four rounds under 11 second. Her best previous finish at a major meet had been a bronze in the 2004 World Indoors over 60 metres. It was later noted that in 2002 she had failed a drug test, which showed clenbuterol, but she was never suspended because the lab that ran the test was not approved by the IAAF.

However, the two had raced 12 times since 2017, and Ingebrigtsen had yet to defeat Cheruiyot. The defending champion was American Matthew Centrowitz, who was back and had recently set a personal best for the mile, running 3:49.26.
Centrowitz did not make the final, placing ninth in the second semi-final. Cheruiyot and Ingebritsen qualified easily and everyone expected the two to set a fast pace in the final, which they did.
Ingebrigtsen took the lead and led through the first lap of the final in 56.2. He was then passed by Cheruiyot who took over at 500 metres. The two pushed the pace through the first three laps, with Cheruiyot passing 800 metres in 1:51.76 and 1,200 metres in 2:47.24. On the final bend, Ingebrigtsen passed Cheruiyot, who could not answer, and the Norwegian pulled away on the straightaway to win the gold medal with five metres to spare over Cheruiyot.
Ingebrigtsen recorded 3:28.32 to Cheruiyot’s 3:29.01, setting an Olympic record and moving him to eighth all-time on the performer list. His finish was blazing for the pace, with the final 100 in 13.6 and the final 200 in 27.1. Behind the top two Great Britain’s Josh Kerr also closed quickly for the bronze medal, running his final 800 metres in 1:49.9, as he set a personal best of 3:29.05, just failing to catch Cheruiyot.

As of 2014 it continues to be raced as a Vintage Yachting Class.
The Swedish crew of Ingvar Hansson and John Albrechtson captured the gold medal in convincing fashion, winning three races, with two seconds, and a fourth. They had finished fourth in this class in 1972 at Kiel. Silver medalist Valentyn Mankin of the Soviet Union had won this event in 1972 and also won gold in the 1968 Finn Class. He would return in 1980 and win a third gold medal in the Star Class.
The crew of the American bronze medal team was Conn Findlay, who had won two golds and a bronze in rowing at the 1956-64 Olympics. His skipper, Dennis Conner, was likely the most famous sailor in American history. This was his only Olympic appearance, but he won the America’s Cup four times as the skipper, in 1974, 1980, 1987, and 1988, and in 1983 he suffered the ignominy of being the first American skipper to ever lose the America’s Cup, to the Australian yacht Australia II, skippered by former Olympic sailor, John Bertrand.
Britain’s team of Alan Warren and David Hunt had won a silver medal in this event in 1972, aboard Gift ‘Orse. They returned in 1976 on the same boat, but it had been damaged in transit to Kingston and they finished only 14th. After the final race, they set the boat aflame, Warren stating, “She went lame on us, so we decided the poor, old ‘orse should be cremated.” Canadian customs authorities did not take this so lightly, as they had difficulty believing the story about why the boat was not available for inspection.

In Werbrouck’s first match, she lost a controversial decision to Spain’s Úrsula Martín. Martín went to the pool final against Howey, who used juji-gatame to defeat her by ippon and advance to the final. There Howey met the other remaining favorite, Veranes.

Frenzel had won the last five overall World Cup titles, and was the defending gold medalist, while Rydzek had won four gold medals at the 2017 World Championships. Japan’s Akito Watabe was also considered a medal contender.
Watabe took the lead in the ski phase, followed by Norwegian Jarl Magnus Riiber, while the German triumvirate – Frenzel, Rydzek, and Fabian Rießle – were in fourth, fifth, and sixth, respectively, with Austrian Willi Denifl in third.
The ski phase was won by Italy’s Alessandro Pittin, who had been a non-factor in the jump, and would finish only 27th overall. Rießle had the third-fastest ski time, but Rydzek was fourth in ski time, and held on to win the gold medal in a remarkably close finish. The three Germans came to the line almost together, with Rydzek winning by 0.4 seconds over Rießle, with Frenzel another four-tenths back, as Germany swept the medals.
Frenzel had already won gold on the normal hill at PyeongChang and would win another gold in the team event, along with Rydzek and Rießle. Rießle had been the bronze medalist in this event at Sochi, but had finished seventh on the normal hill in PyeongChang, done in by a poor jumping performance.
This was the first medal sweep in a Nordic combined individual event since 1936, as Norway had swept all the medals in the only Nordic combined event on the program in 1924, 1928, 1932, and 1936.

In the final Hypólito was on course for gold until he fell landing his final tumbling pass and dropped down to sixth place. Drăgulescu also fell in the final, on his second tumbling pass, and would place seventh. Gold went to China’s Zou Kai, who performed the most difficult final routine, and won easily over Spain’s Gervasio Deferr.

The reigning World Champions were Juan José Román and Juan Sánchez, while the Soviet Union’s Sergey Kalesnik and Anatoly Tishchenko, competing under the banner of the Unified Team for the 1992 Summer Olympics, had taken the title in 1991.
Kalesnik and Tishchenko posted an Olympic record time in the opening round, defeating Román and Sánchez in the process, while the New Zealanders were sent to the repêchage in Germany’s heat and advanced to the semi-finals only by being the fastest fourth-place finisher among the heats. The other heats were won by Americans Michael Harbold and Peter Newton and Poland’s Maciej Freimut and Wojciech Kurpiewski, the 1989 World bronze medalists. In the first semi-final heat, the Italian duo of Antonio Rossi and Bruno Dreossi not only defeated Kalesnik and Tishchenko, but bested their Olympic record and outperformed the Americans. Germany took the other heat over Poland, also getting the better of the Spaniards and helping to eliminate Ferguson and MacDonald. With the two-time defending Olympic champions out of the picture, the gold was guaranteed to go to a new nation, and it found its home around the necks of the deserving German team, who grabbed it over a second and a half before Poland nabbed silver ahead of Italy by a margin of only 0.16 seconds. Bluhm and Gutsche would go on to become double Olympic champions by winning the K-2 1000, while Italy won its first canoe sprint medal since 1960 (Pierpaolo Ferrazzi had won the men’s K-1 Slalom earlier in the Games).

This pair had won the last two editions of the World Championships, been runner-up in 2005, and come in fourth at the 2004 Olympics. No other nation had won more than one medal in the event at the last three World Championships, although the 2005 winners, Zsolt Hirling and Tamás Varga of Hungary, became European Champions when the tournament was resurrected in 2007. The Greek pair of Dimitris Mougios and Vasilios Polymeros, the latter of whom was a bronze medalist from the 2004 Games, were the reigning runners-up at both the Worlds and the Europeans, while Eider Batista and Yunior Pérez of Cuba had won the most recent edition of the Pan American Games.

It seemed possible that the US oligarchy in Olympic basketball might be threatened.
The US chose an all-star team for its 1960 Olympic team, rather than selecting players from a winning team.  The team they chose is often considered the greatest amateur basketball team of all-time.  It was led by guards Oscar Robertson and Jerry West, who thru the 1980s, until the advent of Michael Jordan and Magic Johnson, were often considered the two finest guards in basketball history.  Other future NBA stars on the team included Jerry Lucas, Terry Dischinger (both later NBA rookies-of-the-year), and center Walt Bellamy.  The team was so strong that future NBA star John Havlicek was chosen only as an alternate.
In the Olympic tournament, the United States defeated its three main rivals easily – Brazil by 27 points in the final game, the USSR by 24 points in preliminary competition, and Italy by 31 points in the final pool.

Dan Jansen had won the first 1,000 m at the World Sprint Champions a week before the Games, but after hearing of his sister’s death shortly before the start of the 500 m, Jansen had fallen in his race, and it was unclear what to expect of him. Jansen’s team mate Eric Flaim was better known as a miler, but had won the second 1,000 m at West Allis. The winner of the Olympic 500 m, Uwe-Jens Mey had won two World Cup races in the 1,000 during the season and was highly considered. In addition, there were two Soviet skaters, Igor Zhelezovsky and Nikolay Gulyayev. Zhelezovsky was the 1985 and 1986 World Sprint Champion, and held the 1,500 m world record. Gulyayev had been the star of the 1987 season, winning both the European and World Allround Championships. But at the Davos World Cup in January, it was revealed that Norwegian team members had intercepted packages of anabolic steroids. They had been intended for Stein Olav Krosby, who had been regularly receiving packages of the drugs from Gulyayev, usually using a middle man to deliver them to Krosby. While a Soviet team doctor was fired, Gulyayev was not punished by the Soviet skating federation. As Gulyayev had not tested positive himself, and possession of doping was not illegal per Olympic rules, Gulyayev was able to take part in Calgary as planned.
Of these contenders, Gulyayev was the first to skate. As an allround skater, his 200 m split was relatively poor, but his full laps of 27.16 and 28.70 brought him to 1:13.03, half a second behind the official world record (in March 1987, both Nick Thometz and Andrey Bakhvalov had been faster than Pavel Pegov’s 1:12.58, but their times were not held in an officially announced competition). In the next race, Jansen was, as expected, ahead of Gulyayev’s splits, before falling once again. Pair five then saw Mey and Zhelezovsky race each other. Mey, the better 500 m racer, was well ahead at the bell, while Zhelezovsky matched Gulyayev’s splits. But Mey faded in the final lap. While he was able to hold off Zhelezovsky, he was unable to best Gulyayev’s time, finishing in 1:13.11, against 1:13.19 for his opponent. Flaim, too, was level with Gulyayev at 600 m, but lost half a second in the last lap.

Soviet’s Aleksandr Tikhonov had been the dominant biathlete since his silver medal at the 1968 Winter Olympics, winning individual World Championships gold in 1969 and 1970, silver in 1971, and was also a member of the gold winning Soviet relay team all three years. Magnar Solberg, the surprise Olympic gold medalist from 1968, had won individual bronze medals in the World Championships in 1969 and 1971, and silver with the Norwegian relay team in 1969, 1970 and 1971. However, he still had no medals from Norwegian Championships, and the 35-year old policeman from Trondheim showed no signs of Olympic form at the start of the 1972 season, and was not, in fact, originally chosen for the Norwegian team. The selection committee agreed to give him an extra chance, and he again showed that he was made for big occasions.
After the first shooting round Solberg was in the lead with no misses, 22 seconds ahead of the Swede Lars-Göran Arwidson, with Finland’s Yrjö Salpakari third, 10 seconds behind Arwidson. The favorite Tikhonov had three penalty minutes and was far behind. After the second shooting, Arwidson had taken a clear lead with a perfect round with the rifle. A big surprise was the 27-year-old Italian, Willy Bertin, who had started with one penalty minute, but now had a perfect round and climbed to second, 49 seconds behind Arwidson, and closely followed by Salkapari. Solberg had one penalty minute and dropped down to seventh place, 1:35 behind the leader.
After the third round of shooting the situation changed. Bertin had another perfect round and took over the lead, 32 seconds ahead of East Germany’s Hansjörg Knauthe, who had a one minute penalty from the first shooting round but since then had moved steadily up in the rankings. Salkapari was still in third, closely followed by Solberg, moving from seventh to fourth in spite of one additional penalty minute. Arwidson had two penalty minutes and dropped from first to fifth, but only 11 seconds behind the bronze position.
At the final shooting round, Bertin had four penalty minutes and was out of contention for a medal. Both Solberg, Knauthe, Arwidson and Salpakari had perfect shooting series, but Solberg was the fastest skiier and had a seven seconds lead over Knauthe. Arvidsson and Salpakari were 35 and 45 seconds behind, with no chances for gold. At the finish Solberg had extended his lead over Knauthe to 12 seconds and won his second Olympic gold medal, as dominant as he had been in 1968. Arwidson was able to defend his bronze medal position, ahead of fast finishing Tikhonov, who passed Salpakari in the final stages of the race. Finland’s Esko Saira was the fastest skier of the day, but had to be content with sixth place due to five penalty minutes. A few weeks after his second Olympic gold medal, Solberg was finally able to win a national championship gold medal, and after that he left top-sport to pursue a career as a police officer and criminal investigator.

Silver medalist Peggy Rawls would repeat her silver medal at the 1936 Olympics and also add a bronze medal in swimming in the 4 x 100 freestyle relay. The Americans swept the medals with Jane Fauntz winning bronze. Fauntz had competed at the 1928 Olympics but not in diving. She was also a swimmer who competed in the 200 breaststroke at Amsterdam.
Although they swept the medals, the Americans almost did not get to compete in the finals. All three appeared for warm-up dives and the officials ruled that their uniforms were showing too much back. They were instructed to find other suits to wear for the competition. Rawls and Fauntz had other suits they could use, but Coleman did not, and had to borrow one from breaststroker Peg Hoffman.

The cross-country test consisted of 7 km on roads and paths, followed by a 4 km steeplechase, then 15 km again on roads and paths, followed by 8 km cross-country, finishing with 2 km on the flat. The jumping was contested over 12 obstacles up to 1.20 metres in height.
Finland’s Mauno Roiha led after the dressage phase, ahead of Germany’s Willi Büsing. However, Roiha was disqualified in the cross-country phase, which was led by Sweden’s Hans von Blixen-Finecke, Jr., who also moved into the lead entering the jumping phase, trailed by his teammate Olof Stahre and France’s Guy Lefrant, as Büsing dropped back to fifth place. Büsing was one of nine riders to go clear in the jumping phase, which moved him up to the bronze medal. Both von Blixen-Finecke, Jr. and Lefrant had 10 faults in jumping, but it was good enough for them to win the gold and silver medals, respectively.
Von Blixen-Finecke, Jr.’s father had won a bronze medal in 1912 individual dressage. His aunt was Karen von Blixen-Finecke, better known by her nom de plume of Isak Dinesen, under which she was a well-known author, especially for her work, Out of Africa, which became a popular movie in 1985. Guy Lefrant would win two other Olympics medals, a bronze in 1960 team eventing, and a silver in 1964 team jumping.

But he had a tense battle over five days with 2006 and 2009 Finn World Champion Jonas Høgh Christensen of Denmark.
Høgh Christensen opened up on the first day by winning both races, with Ainslie second. He defeated Ainslie twice more on the second day, and then had another race win on day three. Ainslie finished only third and fourth in day three but moved into second place overall, as he moved ahead of France’s Jonathan Lobert. Ainslie won the first race of day four and then defeated Høgh Christensen again in the second race on that day, although the Dane and Dutchman Pieter-Jan Postma accused him of touching a mark near the end, costing him a penalty turn. On the final day, Høgh Christensen opened his lead over Ainslie to four, but Ainslie won the second race of the day to move ahead before the medal race. In the medal race, Ainslie focused only on staying ahead of Høgh Christensen, and did so, placing ninth to the Dane’s 10th, assuring himself of a fourth straight gold medal. Lobert won the medal race to move ahead of Postma and take the bronze medal. Postma actually challenged for the top spot in the medal race, but at the last buoy he hit the camera on another boat, forcing him to take a penalty lap and dropping him off the podium.
Ainslie equaled the feat of another Dane, Paul Elvstrøm, who won the Finn class in 1952-60. Elvstrøm also won the one-person dinghy in 1948, but the boat was slightly different, racing in the Firefly that year, however, he is usually credited with four straight gold medals in the same class. Only Ainslie and Elvstrøm have won four gold medals in sailing, and Ainslie’s fifth sailing medal equaled the most in the sport, held by Brazil’s pair of Robert Scheidt, who had earlier achieved this in London, and Torben Grael.

Norway’s Thor Thorvaldsen, aboard Pan, won the first and fourth races, and had a comfortable lead going into the final race.

Silvano Abba (ITA) took the early lead, winning the horse steeplechase, with Germany’s Gotthardt Handrick and Belgium’s Raoul Mollet tying for second. Handrick then placed second in épée fencing and took a big lead with only 4½ points after two phases. The third phase was rapid-fire pistol shooting and Charles Leonard (USA) scored big here, winning the competition with the first ever possible of 200 in modern pentathlon rapid-fire pistol shooting. This moved him into fourth place overall but Handrick was still well ahead. Handrick maintained his lead after the swim, followed by Thofelt, who moved into second, placing third in the swim. Leonard was sixth in the 300 metre freestyle to move into the bronze medal position after four days of competition. The cross-country run was won by Austria’s Karl Leban, although it only served to move him from 35th to 26th place. Handrick placed 14th in the run, but was not really challenged for the gold medal. Leonard tied for seventh running to move up to a silver medal, followed by Abba, who won the bronze medal, with Thofelt falling to fourth (as in 1932) with a 24th place finish in the run. For the first time ever, no Swede won a medal.
Handrick soon afterwards became a fighter pilot with the “Legion Condor,” a squadron of German volunteers for the Fascist cause in the Spanish Civil War.

Hilgertová had a poor qualifying round, finishing 11th, while Kaliská was second behind Germany’s Jennifer Bongardt, the 2003 World runner-up.  Great Britain’s Helen Reeves came in third. Kaliská was at the top of the rankings after the first run of the final, while Peggy Dickens of France was second and Bongardt was third. Reeves, meanwhile, came in with a fifth-place score while Hilgertová was eighth. Kaliská was first again in the second run and secured the gold medal while 2002 World Champion Rebecca Giddens’ second-place was sufficient for silver, after having been fourth in first portion. Hilgertová was third, but her earlier placing meant that she would rise no higher than fifth. Thus bronze seemed to go Dickens, but she was dealt an extra penalty point at the conclusion of the event and lost the final podium spot to Reeves by a mere 0.03 points.

Due to warm weather, the race was cancelled after a few pairs and never concluded. Two decades later, the 10,000 m was once again the victim of weather conditions. Again, warm weather marred the competition after just a few pairs, although not as badly as the previous time. Unlike in 1928, the race was completed, and medals were awarded.
All top skaters raced in the early pairs, when the weather was still acceptable. However, the weather was not the only problem for the competitors; the thin St. Moritz air also proved a difficulty for many. One of them was 5,000 m bronze medallist Göthe Hedlund, who had recorded a nice 17.17,1 in December. He had to give up in the first pair, which was won by his compatriot Harry Jansson. The other Swedish medal candidate, Åke Seyffarth had been in doubt about starting the race, but these doubts proved ungrounded. He opened up a quick lead on Finland’s Pertti Lammio, which would only grow larger. Thanks to two impressive 41-second laps at the end, the clock stopped at a very respectable 17.26,3, with Lammio some 16 seconds behind that.
World Champion Lassi Parkkinen and Hungarian Kornél Pajor contested the third pair, and both began their races faster than Seyffarth. At a third of the distance, Pajor lost connection with Parkkinen, who also gradually slowed. At 7,200 m, the Finn still came through in the same time as the leader, but he could not keep up the pace any longer, losing nearly 10 seconds in the remaining laps for second place. With the gold and silver medallists of the 5,000 m drawn in the next pair, Parkkinen was not expected to hold on to this position. However, a few puddles of water appeared on the track, as a sign of deteriorating weather conditions. Still, Reidar Liaklev managed to copy Seyffarth’s times and seemed headed for a medal, when he suddenly slowed noticeably. Like Hedlund, Liaklev suffered from the altitude, and stepped out of the race. Lundberg, nearly half a lap behind at that point, did finish the race. It would later turn out he was the only Norwegian to do so, finishing only in seventh. With temperatures rising, the standings did not change in the remaining pairs. Seyffarth’s victory marked the first Olympic title for Sweden.
While conditions were bad for all skaters after the fifth pair, Richard Solem was probably most affected. Because his opponent forfeited, he had to skate alone at the end of the programme. He consistently clocked lap times of over 1 minute and finished after 26.22,4, by far the worst time recorded in Olympic history. US journalist Ted Smits wrote: )[the ice] became so mushy by early afternoon that Richard Solem of Chicago, racing at the very end of the program after eight men had dropped out due to poor ice and the altitude, ploughed through slush up to the tubes of his skates. But he gamely finished, and his time of 26 minutes, 22.4 seconds attested to the ordeal. He was cheered for 19th place almost as loudly as the victor.)

But Wieneke then attacked with uchimata, only to be repelled by Adams’ left hand. Wieneke then spun and grabbed Adams’s left hand, using seoi-nage to throw him for an immediate ippon.

However, in the final against the Russian Koblova, she found herself trailing late in the match, behind 2-1. Then, with five seconds left on the clock to make Olympic history, Icho was awarded a two-point score, and dramatically won 3-2.

This made them the heavy favorites in Melbourne, but they were not without challengers: Michel Knuysen and Bob Baetens of Belgium had won the 1953 Silver Goblets & Nickalls’ Challenge Cup, the 1951 European Championships, silver at the 1953 and 1955 editions, bronze in 1956, and silver at the 1952 Summer Olympics. The United States was the defending champion and sent a strong team consisting of Jim Fifer and Duvall Hecht, who had earned their spot by defeating the reigning champions Charlie Logg and Tom Price. Alfred Sageder and Josef Kloimstein of Austria were silver medalists at the most recent European Championships, while Reginald Douglas and Bob Parker of New Zealand were the reigning British Empire and Commonwealth champions.
The United States was dominant in the competition: at no point in any round were they seriously challenged by another crew and they captured the gold medal with ease. Belgium was eliminated in the opening round following a surprisingly poor performance, while New Zealand failed to make the cut in the semi-finals, leaving the Soviet Union, Austria, and Australia to scramble for the final two podium spots. Australia began with a huge push that saw them briefly ahead, but they were soon overtaken by the Soviet Union, and then Austria, who earned silver and bronze respectively in a final where every finisher was separated by at least seven a half seconds.
Unfortunately, Viktor Ivanov dropped his silver medal in the waters of Lake Wendouree. He dove into the lake to try to find it along with several young schoolboys who were there but they were unsuccessful in finding it. One of the schoolboys, Andrew Hemingway, a 13-year-old student at Ballarat High School, went home but then returned to the lake to search some more. He actually stepped on the medal and was able to retrieve it. The next morning he showed it to his headmaster at school, who alerted the Ballarat City Council. Hemingway was able to return the medal to Ivanov in a ceremony at Ballarat City Hall, with Ivanov giving Hemingway a box of other medals. The story of the drowned medal is often attributed to Vyacheslav Ivanov in the single sculls, including previously by us at Olympedia and by David Wallechinsky in early editions of The Complete Book of the Olympics, but that is incorrect and the story is as given here.

Lambert also competed in the Olympic competition, finishing eighth with rounds of 94-95.  He was from St. Louis and when Olympic golf returned to St. Louis in 1904, Lambert would again compete, making him the only person to play in both Olympic golf tournaments.  In fact, Lambert was the man responsible for the 1904 Olympic golf event.
Lambert was a wealthy man.  He founded Lambert Pharmacal Co., later Warner-Lambert, best-known as the makers of Listerine.  His avocation in later years became flying and he was the primary benefactor for Charles Lindbergh’s trans-atlantic flight.  For his contributions to aviation, the St. Louis airport was named Lambert International Field.
In 1900 Lambert played the Olympic golf event while on a business trip to his Paris office.  On his return he mentioned the Olympic golf event to his father-in-law, Colonel George McGrew.  McGrew was the founder of Glen Echo Golf Club in St. Louis and with the Olympics coming to St. Louis in 1904, Lambert and McGrew put forth plans to conduct an Olympic golf tournament at Glen Echo.

Mizler had the misfortune to be drawn against Bor in his first bout and the home crowd cheered the American on to victory. Another first round loser was the Japanese fighter Otsu Shuko, although born in Japan; Shuko was an ethnic Korean, the first to compete in Olympic boxing, and known in his mother language as Hwang Eul-Su.
Bor was not however destined to be Olympic champion; his performance in the semi-final against the tall Swede Thure Ahlqvist was described as sluggish and disappointing, Ahlqvist using his height and reach advantage to keep his opponent at bay whilst occasionally landing stiff right hands to the jaw of the American. The other semi saw the demise of the Italian Bianchini, conclusively defeated on points by Stevens of South Africa. Ahlqvist could not repeat his semi-final performance in the gold medal bout and Stevens became the first of two South African boxers to win gold medals in the Olympic Auditorium.
As a professional Stevens’ career suffered from the outbreak of the Second World War. He had been South African lightweight and welterweight champion and with a victory over the legendary Englishman, Jack “Kid” Berg, become the lightweight champion of the British Empire. Any hopes he had of fighting for the world title never came true and he retired in 1945 after a knockout defeat. Nat Bor won 47 of his first 48 professional fights but his career fizzled out and he would never fight for a title belt, Mauro Bianchini would go on to be Italian national welterweight champion and Harry Mizler would also go on to be a national champion as a pro.

For the first and only time, the World Championships were held concurrently with the Olympics and the Olympic Champions also became World Champions.

However, it was the 1899 World Championships silver medallist Kellenberger who won the gold medal with the best performance in the kneeling phase, and tied with second-placed Anders Peter Nielsen, followed by steady performances in the prone and standing elements. Nielsen lost the gold medal because of his weaker effort standing. The results in Paris were relatively poor. Kellenberger’s final score of 930 was the lowest ever to win a gold medal in this event at the World Championships (1897 cannot be compared) and would have only brought him just a bronze in 1898 and 1899.

That year’s champion had been Marie Martinod of France, who was also the runner-up at the 2014 Olympics and the most recent edition of the World Championships.

Ranked number one in the world overall, however, was Canadian Cassie Sharpe, whose greatest achievements prior to the 2018 Olympics were probably her silver medal from the 2015 World Championships and bronze from the 2018 Winter X Games. She came out in first after the qualification round, but was followed closely behind by Martinod, while Onozuka and Bowman finished somewhat down the list in fifth and sixth. In the final, however, Sharpe was completely superior, with her score in the first run being sufficient to have won the gold medal. She did not relax, however, and scored even higher on her second run and, with gold virtually guaranteed, attempted in an incredibly difficult and rarely-seen trick for her final attempt. Although she failed to land it successfully, her prior efforts had secured her a gold medal. Martinod pulled off an impressive series of tricks in her attempts to catch up to Sharpe, but the Canadian was simply too dominant, and Martinod had to settle once again for silver.
Bowman, on the other hand, had a streak of bad luck and failed to complete any of her landings, placing her at the bottom of the results. Onozuka performed well, but ended up in fifth after she was outclassed by two other Americans.

After the Soviet domination in the 10 km race four days earlier, the 5 km race was expected to be another triumphant day for the Soviets. When the intermediate times after 2.5 km were announced in the Seefeld Cross Country Stadium, it was met with surprise. In the lead was a 22-year-old skier from Finland, Senja Pusula, 3.1 seconds ahead of another first time Olympian, Sweden’s Toini Gustafsson. But it was very close. Less than two seconds behind Gustafsson followed the newly crowned Olympic Champion Klavdiya Boyarskikh, another Nordic surprise, the 21-year-old Finn Mirja Lehtonen, and two more Soviet skiers, Yevdokiya Mekshilo and Kolchina.
Pusula faded in the last part of the race and dropped down to ninth place at the finish, but her teammate Lehtonen was the big surprise of the day. Starting one and a half minute earlier than Boyarskikh, she continued her pace, and Boyarskikh had to struggle hard at the final part of the race to beat the young Finn by a scant margin of 2.4 seconds. Kolchina was able to advance from her sixth position halfway and secured her only individual Olympic medal.

Sheffield Speed Skating Oval, Lake Placid",16 from 4 countries,na,na,"The heats of the 500 m got underway immediately after the opening ceremony. The 16 competitors were divided into three heats, with the first two in each heat qualifying for the final. The first race got underway with Japanese Shozo Ishihara taking the lead, but he was caught by local hero Jack Shea on the backstretch. He raced shoulder to shoulder on the final straight with North American champion Frank Stack of Canada, easing up before the finish as their gap to the rest was sufficient. Defending Olympic Champion Evensen was drawn in the second heat, which he won ahead of Willy Logan, who surprisingly eliminated Ray Murray, one of the favourites. In the final heat, a third Canadian - Alex Hurd - qualified for the final, while John O’Neil Farrell edged out his team-mate Allan Potts for the last berth. Norway’s Haakon Pedersen, one of the favourites, failed to qualify after being obstructed by Farrell, but no protests appear to have been lodged. Pedersen took revenge two weeks later, winning the 500 m at the World Championships, also held in Lake Placid.
After the first half of the Canada–USA hockey game, the competition resumed with the final. Three Canadians (Stack, Logan, Hurd), two Americans (Shea, Farrell) and one Norwegian (Evensen) formed the field. Starting positions were decided by the drawing of lots, resulting in the following set-up (inside-to-outside): Evensen, Farrell, Shea, Logan, Stack, Hurd. Farrell and Shea tried to switch positions, but they were recalled. Shea opened up a gap with the pack directly from the start, followed by Evensen and Logan. Going into the final curve, Shea had a 3 yard gap on the Norwegian, which he managed to extend further in the final 100 meters, breaking the finish tape with 5 metres on Evensen, who was followed by Hurd, Logan, Stack and Farrell. His time of 43.4 was the fastest time of the season up to that moment, and equalled the Olympic Record.
After the race, the three medalists became the first Olympians to be awarded their prizes on a podium, as it is still done today. The ceremony was far less organised than it is now, the podium being crowded by bystanders and nearly invisible for most spectators. An embarrassing incident occurred when IOC president Henri de Baillet-Latour handed out the wrong medals to Evensen and Hurd. The two skaters were standing on the wrong side of champion Shea, but this was not noticed by the highest Olympic official.

The 2012 Games, therefore, looked to be promising for her to finally win Olympic gold. The duo’s only real challenge would come from the Australian team of Kim Crow and Brooke Pratley. Crow and teammate Kerry Hore had come in second at the last two World Champions behind Britain and, although Hore decided to conserve her strength for the women’s quadruple sculls, Crow chose to take up the oars for both the single and double sculls and picked Pratley, the 2006 World Champion in double sculls, as her partner. The only other true contenders for a podium spot were Poland’s Magdalena Fularczyk and Julia Michalska, who were World Champions in the event in 2009.
As expected, Great Britain and Australia had the two fastest times in the heats, guaranteeing an exciting final along Eton Downey. Thousands of British fans roared and cheered as Grainger and Watkins took an early lead, followed closely by Crow and Pratley. In the second half of the course, Britain broke away from their rivals and pulled out to a sizeable lead; by the 1500m mark, the duo was all but assured the gold medal while crowd and media commentators alike were on their feet, caught up in the rush of excitement. Australia never relented on their challenge and ended up with a respectable effort and a silver medal, nearly ten seconds ahead of Poland, the bronze medal finalists. Thus Grainger and Watkins captured only the second gold medal for British women’s rowing, the first having come earlier in the Games from Helen Glover and Heather Stanning in the coxless pairs.

Spain’s José Luis Doreste finished only third in the race, but it was good enough for the gold medal when Peter Holmberg of the United States Virgin Islands finished only second. Doreste had been disqualified in the fourth race and was upset with his opponents, accusing them of trying to win “in the jury room” instead of on the water. In that race, Holmberg had gone over the starting line and the premature start dropped him to last-place points, eventually depriving him of the gold medal. Doreste’s brother, Luis Doreste, had won a gold medal in the 470 class at the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics. Holmberg’s silver was the first Olympic medal won by the U.S. Virgin Islands.
In race five of the Finn class, Joseph Chan of Singapore, who was racing concurrently in the 470 class, went overboard and was being swept away by the currents, unable to resist much because of a back injury. He was rescued by Canada’s Finn entrant Lawrence Lemieux, who had been in second place when he saw Chan struggling in the water, but deviated from his course to rescue him. Lemieux eventually finished 11th in the class, but was awarded the points for a second place position in race five, his placement when he left for the rescue. For his actions, he was given the Pierre de Coubertin Award by the IOC.

The Beijing race took place in difficult weather conditions, but Fillon Maillet made no mistakes in heavy snowfall, bitterly cold temperatures (-14°C), and icy winds in the Zhangjiakou National Biathlon Centre.
The silver medal went to Tarjei Bø (+28.6 seconds), and bronze went to Eduard Latypov (+35.3 seconds), both with one penalty. Latypov was ahead of Bø for most of the race but lost 15.9 seconds on the last loop and had to settle for bronze.
Tarjei’s brother, Johannes Thingnes Bø, who started with a comfortable lead of 41.0 seconds after the sprint, experienced an unfortunate race. In his third round of shooting, he had the worst of the conditions. In total, the 28-year-old went into the penalty loop seven times (0-2-3-2). However, because of his outstanding skiing speed, Bø still finished fifth. None of the other top six biathletes missed more than one target.
Veteran Lukas Hofer was the only other athlete other than Fillon Maillet with a clear shooting performance, but eventually placed fourth, losing the medal due to slowing down on the track in the last third of the race.

Each competitor had three 45 second runs, of which only the best score counted. The final was scored by the same format. The qualifying round went badly for the Americans. Of the three-strong team, only Juneau made it through to the final and he only scraped through as the final qualifier. Instead it was Brazil and Australia who dominated qualifying as they filled the top five positions.
The leader after the first run in the final was California-born Australian Keegan Palmer, who scored 94.04. Pedro Barros and Juneau scored in the mid-80s to place on the Olympic podium, but Palmer was never to be seriously threatened for the rest of the competition.

Ledecká with bib number 2 set the early pace only to be overtaken by the next starter Mirjam Puchner, by 0.21 seconds. The next two, Michelle Gisin and Tippler, placed between them with Gisin only 0.08 behind Puchner and Tippler another 0.03 seconds behind. Two racers later, Gut-Behrami with bib number 7 set the best time and took the lead from Puchner by 0.22 seconds. The top five places did not change as all the favourites failed to jeopardise those times, with neither Brignone, Curtoni, Hütter, Shiffrin, nor Suter coming near to a podium place.
Gut-Behrami won the race with an average speed of 97.16 km/h and 5.92 metres ahead of Puchner. For the first time in Beijing, three different manufacturers reached the podium, with Head again winning gold and Atomic and Rossignol taking the other medals. Gut-Behrami won the first ever gold medal for Switzerland in this event, who had only previously won a solitary silver medal, while Austria had won at least one medal in each of the last five editions. Only a few minutes before Mirjam Puchner went down with bib number 3, her brother Joachim Puchner skied down the track with a camera for Austrian television.

But that belied recent tournament history. Sweden had won the 1957 World Championship, with the USSR second. Canada had won the 1958 and 1959 World Championships. With Czechoslovakia, it was thought that any one of four teams could have won the 1960 Olympic ice hockey gold medal. The Canadian team was again the Kitchener-Waterloo Dutchmen as the Allan Cup champions, the Whitby Dunlops, declined the invitation to skate in the Olympics.
The United States was represented by a young team of players from Boston and Minnesota and was not expected to challenge for the gold medal.  They played an 18-game tour prior to the Squaw Valley Games, winning 10, tying 4, and losing 4 games, hardly scaring anyone.  But in their first Olympic match, they upset Czechoslovakia, 7-5, and advanced to the medal round.  On February 27, the Americans faced the Soviets, and prevailed 3-2, led by the goaltending of Jack McCartan. The next day the Americans again met the Czechoslovak team, and trailed 4-3, after two periods. In the US locker room between periods, Soviet player Nikolay Sologubov came in and showed the US players that they should take oxygen to give them more stamina for the final period. They did so, and trounced the Czechs in the 3rd period, winning 7-5.

The race was held as scheduled on Saturday, 15 February, in the Rosa Khutor Alpine Center and started at an altitude of 1,580 metres between the sections “Devil’s Spine” and “Forest Drop”. During this winter the five World Cup Super Gs were won by Lara Gut (Beaver Creek, Lake Louise, and the second race in Cortina), Tina Weirather (St. Moritz), and Elisabeth Görgl (first race in Cortina) and the current standing saw Gut in the lead ahead of Weirather, Anna Fenninger, and Görgl, the 2011 World Champion. But Weirather was unable to compete after her crash in the last downhill training run when she sustained a shin contusion. Lindsey Vonn, bronze medalist from Vancouver and Super G World Cup winner 2010/11 and 2011/12, also missed the Games after tearing her right ACL twice in 2013, and 2010 gold medalist Andrea Fischbacher failed to qualify. This left Tina Maze, the 2010 silver medallist, reigning World Champion from 2013, and winner of the Super G World Cup in 2012/13 as the favorite.
The race started unusually as seven of the first eight starters did not finish the course. When second starter Leanne Smith (USA) came down the course in 1:28.38, she didn’t realise that the next six skiers would fail to finish. Finally Fabienne Suter (SUI) with bib number 9 did complete the course in a respectable 1:26.89, which would eventually place her seventh. Nevertheless her time was not beaten until seven skiers later, when Nicole Hosp (AUT) took the lead in a time of 1:26.18. Her countrywoman, Anna Fenninger then skied the course 0.66 seconds better than Hosp, giving the Austrians the first two places. Tina Maze (SLO) took over the bronze medal place with a time of 1:26.28, but this was short lived as Lara Gut (SUI) went 0.03 seconds faster. In the end the two Austrian leaders were split when Super Combined winner Maria Höfl-Riesch (GER) posted a time of 1:26.07, taking the silver medal.
Fenninger, who was the third Austrian in a row to win the women’s Super G after Dorfmeister in 2006 and Fischbacher in 2010, won the race with an average speed of 88.40 km/hr, 13.42 metres ahead of Höfl-Riesch. Both Fenninger and Höfl-Riesch used Head skis, while bronze medalist Hosp used Fischer. The gold medal awarded to Fenninger included a fragment of the Chelyabinsk meteor, which burst in a superbolide flash over the Chelyabinsk Oblast and caused a powerful shock wave exactly one year prior to this event, on 15 February 2013.

He also beat Slovenia’s Adrian Gomboc. The Slovenian was the only opponent lower than Basile in the ranking list and in the semi-final he resisted Basile for the complete five minutes but lost by two Shidos (penalties) for non-combativity. In the final Basile faced the top ranked reigning World Champion An Ba-Ul of Korea. Basile surprised him with a Seoi-otoshi (back-drop) scoring an Ippon just 1:24 min into the bout.
Bronze medals went to Rishod Sobirov of Uzbekistan and Masashi Ebinuma of Japan, both previous World Champions. Both were defeated by An in the quarter-finals and semi-finals respectively of the elimination round.

The New York Athletic Club withdrew after losing to Milwaukee and did not pull as scheduled against the first St. Louis team.  As a result, although New York had finished fourth, Chicago tried to protest their finish, which was worth one point in the team race, but to no avail.
Each match had a five-minute time limit.  The winner was the first team to pull the other team over a line six feet from their starting point.  If no team pulled the other over the line by the time limit, then the losing team was the team closest to that line.

Great Britain and New Zealand won their preliminary heats, but Romania finished a surprising last in a heat won by Americans Grace Luczak and Felice Mueller, the latter of whom was 2015 World bronze medalist. Luczak, meanwhile, was had twice been World Champion in the eights and once in the fours. Romania rebounded by winning the repêchage, but was eliminated in the semifinals behind Great Britain, the United States, and South Africans Lee-Ann Persse and Kate Christowitz. In the other semifinal, the unheralded Danish duo of Hedvig Rasmussen and Anne Andersen finished ahead of the New Zealanders to earn an unexpected berth in the final. There they performed admirably and even led for a time in an exciting race, but were no match ultimately for the Britons and the New Zealanders, who finished first and second respectively, leaving Denmark to settle for bronze.

Any possibility that the Australian authorities would reach a similar decision about Clare was removed when she set a world record in early 1932. The young Australian still had the cost of the trip to America to worry about but her journey was eventually financed by colleagues of her late father in the Sydney police. One swimmer who did not make the trip to the USA was Lisa Rocke of Germany who, despite having beaten the Aussie’s world record earlier in the summer, was not selected by Germany. Clare Dennis was ill on arrival in California, suffered a toe injury before the heats and then, after cruising into the semi-final, suffered an anxious wait as officials debated whether to disqualify her from wearing an “inappropriate swimsuit”, the debate centring on how much of the shoulders she was allowed to expose.  After being cleared of any misdemeanour, she swam in the final and kept a narrow lead throughout the course of the race.

Her latest world records were 117 kg in snatch, 145 kg in clean & jerk, and 261 kg in total.

She was also the 2017 world champion (63 kg) when China was banned. At the last two World championships, Toma finished third with Rim Un-Sim winning silver on both occasions, but as PRK decided not to send a team to the Olympics due to the COVID-19 pandemic, none of the medallists from the last two World Championships competed in Tokyo. Consequently, Mercedes Pérez, qualification best 238 kg, who finished fourth at the last two World Championships, was one of the favourites, but she was beaten by Maude Charron, season best 240 kg, at the Pan American Championships just a few months before the Tokyo Games. Other fancied competitors were Sarah Davies, season best 230 kg and silver medallist at the last European Championships, Angie Paola Palacios, season best 229 kg, and Chen Wen-Huei, season best 228 kg and reigning Asian champion.

Charron and Palacios both missed 108 kg in their last attempts and Pérez failed 105 kg with her final lift. The clean & jerk started with nine athletes separated by only 5 kg. When Palacios missed 127 kg in her last lift, five athletes were still fighting for the medals, but only Bordignon with 128 kg and Charron with 133 kg were able to set valid lifts. This gave Charron gold and Bordignon silver with Chen taking bronze. Bordignon enjoyed a perfect competition, setting personal bests in both variants of the lifts, and was the only athlete in this event who did not miss any of her six lifts, as she won the first ever Olympic weightlifting medal by an Italian female. Also competing in this event was Yasmin Zammit Stevens, the first ever Maltese female weightlifter.

One of his victims was No. 2 seeded Enrico Garozzo in the round of the last 16. In the semi-final Park dominated Benjamin Steffen from Switzerland, ranked 13th in the world, 15-9 and advanced to the final. There, his opponent, Hungarian Géza Imre, looked like a sure winner, leading 14-10 against the Korean. But in an exciting comeback, Park managed to score point by point and finally beat Imre 15-14 after a five point rally as the youngest in the field beat the oldest. The 41-year-old Imre became fencing’s oldest individual Olympic medalist since 1952. In Helsinki, fencing legend Aladár Gerevich, also from Hungary, was 42 when he won the silver in the men’s sabre. The number one seeded Frenchman Gauthier Grumier pinned down all opponents easily before the semi-finals. There, he met Imre, who had already beaten him in the final of the 2015 World Championships. The Hungarian held on to a three point lead countering Grumier’s attacks with simultaneous touches to win 15-13. Grumier took the  bronze medal beating Steffen 15-11.

After a relatively lean period following the 2000 Games he had re-established his reputation by claiming his second European title earlier in 2004.  However Saitov was not the favourite for the title – that honour went to [Lorenzo Aragon], the Cuban who had won both World Championships since the last Olympics.
The anticipated face-off between Saitov and Aragon never materialized as the Russian’s run of wins was snapped in his 13th Olympic bout.  Saitov’s unlikely conqueror was the unheralded 21 year old Kazakh Bakhtiyar Artayev who had only qualified for Athens after winning the last chance Asian qualifying tournament.  Artayev’s task appeared even more insurmountable against Aragon in the final but the underdog rallied after losing the first round and gradually took control of the fight. By the end of the four rounds the Kazakh held a ten point lead and had broken the winning streak of the Cuban which went back 18 months. Artayev’s outstanding performances in the semi-final and final earned him the Val Barker Trophy for the most stylish boxer of the competition. Although he boxed for another eight years at the top international level and won medals at World and Asian championships he never again quite reached the same level of performance at he showed in 2004 and was eliminated at the quarter-final stage in Beijing.

This change had been made even before the 2020 pandemic postponement, and it helped as Sapporo was cooler than Tokyo, but hardly ideal marathon conditions as the dew point was 22° C. (72° F.), although overcast skies did give the runners some relief.
Kenyan Eliud Kipchoge was the defending gold medalist and the heavy favorite. He had won 14 of his 16 career marathons, was the world record holder, and in a special paced race in Wien (Vienna) in October 2019, had broken the fabled 2-hour marathon barrier, although because of pacing, and other assistance, it was not eligible for world record status.
Likely because of the heat, the early miles were run at a leisurely pace, with over 30 runners together at the halfway point. At 25 km Kipchoge went to the lead and picked up the pace, and 10 runners remained with him to 30 km. At that point he challenged them, and nobody could answer. He had run a 15:07 split from 25-30 km, but Kipchoge ran the 30-35 km segment in 14:28 and the battle for gold was over, as the final 7 km loop was but a victory lap. He eventually finished in 2-08:38 to win by over a minute.
Behind Kipchoge a pack of five runners were together from 30-35 km, which included the Netherlands Abdi Nageeye, his Belgian training partner Bashir Abdi, both originally from Somalia, and Kenya’s Lawrence Cherono. Those three would finish almost together in a close sprint finish, with Nageeye taking silver and Bashir bronze, as Cherono trailed in fourth, only four seconds separating the three.
Kipchoge’s victory made him only the third marathoner to win two Olympic gold medals, after Ethiopia’s Abebe Bikila in 1960-64 and East German Waldemar Cierpinski in 1976-80. It was also his fourth Olympic medal as he had won bronze in the 5,000 metres in 2004, improving to silver in that event in 2008.

Two favourites to take the title were American Jamie Anderson, who was looking to defend her Olympic gold medal from Sochi, and Austria’s Anna Gasser, the 2015 World Championships slopestyle silver medalist (also 2017 big air World champion). Missing from the competition was New Zealand’s Christy Prior whose knee injury had her Olympic qualification campaign starting too late in the season.
The qualifying portion of the women’s snowboard slopestyle competition originally scheduled for 11 February had been cancelled due to strong winds at the Phoenix Snow Park complex and all competitors advanced to the final. They competed in a two-run final round instead of the typical two-run qualification round and three-run final round.
On the day of the final, the athletes were ordered by world ranking, which allowed Anderson, No. 1 in the world, the opportunity to go last. The conditions had actually deteriorated up high on the mountain with the starting time delayed for more than an hour. In dangerously windy conditions, some riders just coasted to the bottom, with 41 of 50 runs seeing riders crash or pull up on jumps. Of the 25 athletes, only five managed to stay on their feet during the first run and no one recorded two clear runs.
Despite the horrendous and bitterly cold conditions, Anderson’s first run score of 83 held up for gold, successfully defending her 2014 Olympic title with a score that would have placed seventh in Sochi. She finished nearly seven points ahead of silver medalist Laurie Blouin from Canada. Finland’s Enni Rukajärvi, the 2011 World champion and 2014 silver medalist, won the bronze. The silver and bronze medal scores would have failed to qualify in the 2014 Olympics.

Fick travelled to Germany as the marginal favourite although the strength in depth of the Japanese team made sure that predicting the competition would be difficult. Fick disappointed in the final but the Japanese victory did not materialize either. Although Ferenc Csik was the reigning European champion, he was not expected to defeat the American or Japanese favourites but as they battled each other, Csik came through on the outside to surprise them all. Ferenc Csik would not live to see the next Olympic Games. By then a qualified doctor, he died during an air raid in 1945.
Masanori Yusa and Shigeo Arai of Japan were awarded the other medals although the actual finishing positions are a matter of debate. Photographic evidence suggests that 4th placed Masahuru Taguchi may in fact have been the true silver medallist with only the first and last places in the final certain to be correct.

The gold medal bout against Nurmagomed Shanavazov of the Soviet Union was not a thing of beauty and was described by a newspaper columnist as like watching )Two angry wildebeests shoulder-charging each other around the ring) but the American did enough to win a clear decision.

Silver went to the Swedish pair of Maja Dahlqvist and Jonna Sundling, who took gold and silver in the women’s individual sprint and went into the team final as favorites. Bronze was claimed by the Russian Olympic Committee’s team with Yuliya Stupak and Nataliya Nepryayeva.
In bright sunshine and a freezing cold temperature of -16.7° C, Hennig and Carl had previously won their semi-final and thus qualified directly for the final, beating the USA and Austria. Carl had replaced Katherine Sauerbrey, who was originally nominated but did not feel quite fit. The second semi-final went to the ROC, followed by Finland and Sweden.
As expected, the field stayed close together on the opening laps. On the fourth leg, Sweden’s Sundling increased the pace at the front and, along with Diggins, created a small gap. Carl could not quite follow and handed over almost four seconds behind. Hennig, however, was able to re-establish contact with the leaders. She attacked with Finland’s Kerttu Niskanen and tried to outdistance the chasers. Carl went into the final lap with a minimal lead of 0.17, but on the first climb, the first five closed ranks again. Carl ran the last bend in third place, but had the outside lane and pushed past the opposition. She had the most reserves in the final sprint and was the first to cross the line. It was also a birthday present for their coach Peter Schlickenrieder, who won silver at the 2002 Olympic Winter Games exactly 20 years ago, and turned 52 on the day of the Beijing event. Finland with Krista Pärmäkoski dropped back on the last climb, after making most of the leader’s work.

The fifth skier off was France’s Franck Piccard, the bronze medalist in the downhill who had been named after Frank Sinatra. Piccard was initially angry with his time, feeling he had made several mistakes late in the run, but as the remaining seeded skiers came down, his time held up and he had the first Olympic gold medal in the super-G.

Nor did the previous Olympic champions and runners-up, the United States and the Soviet Union, return with their victorious members. The Americans sent Ted Frost and Robert Rogers of Seattle’s Lake Washington Rowing Club, because they had won the event at the 1959 Pan American Games. The Soviet Union, meanwhile, sent 1959 European runners-up Valentin Boreyko and Oleg Golovanov. The 1956 Olympic bronze medalists from Austria, Alfred Sageder and Josef Kloimstein, returned in another bid to capture gold. They were also the most recent European bronze medalists. Canadian Lorne Loomer, a 1956 Olympic champion in the coxless fours, was replaced by David Anderson in the coxed eights crew that would go on to win silver in that event, and sent to assist Keith Donald.
Of these nations, however, only the Soviet Union managed to win a heat in an opening round that saw strong performances from Germany, Italy, and Finland. The Americans and the Austrians survived to the semi-finals after the repêchage, however, with the latter winning a heat shared with the two global superpowers. The USSR regained its dominance in the final and won a convincing victory over the Austrians, who duked it out for silver with the Finns and emerged victorious by just over a tenth of a second, leaving Finland to settle for bronze.

In the quarters he faced the much shorter American Montell Griffin, who opened a big cut over May’s eye in the final round. The referee actually stopped the fight but the ring doctor let it go on, with Griffin leading. But Griffin then received a third warning for leading with his head (ducking), and was given a 3-point penalty, which proved decisive as May won the match, 6-4.

All the favourites easily qualified directly into the semi-finals. Carrington and Regal won the first semi while Kozák and Bodonyi won the second semi to set up an interesting battle for the gold medal. The final was the fourth race (and second final) of the day for Carrington.
Just 90 minutes after winning gold in the K-1 200, Carrington jumped back in the boat and won the K-2 500 race. Poland’s Karolina Naja and Anna Pulawska followed in the silver medal position, with Kozák and Bodonyi pipping compatriots Tamara Csipes and Erika Medveczky to the bronze medal. Naja had already won bronze with a different partner in this discipline in London and Rio. Winning two gold medals in one day took Carrington’s career total to four Olympic golds, just one behind her main rival, Kozák.

The trio of main protagonists were reigning champion Ellen Preis of Austria, 1928 victor Helene Mayer of Germany and European champion Ilona Elek of Hungary. All three were Jewish.
Helene Mayer was the daughter of a Jewish father and a Protestant mother and although she did not implicitly think of herself as being Jewish, this was not enough to shield herself from persecution in Germany after Hitler’s rise to power. With a growing threat by a number of nations to boycott the Games in protest at the actions of the National Socialist government in Germany, it was considered prudent for the German team to include a Jewish athlete in their Olympic team. Mayer, by now resident in California, was invited back home to compete for Germany in Berlin.
The final pool was a close affair. Ilek lost to the second ranked German Hedwig Haß but defeated both Mayer and Preis to post a 6-1 record which was enough to clinch the gold medal.  Mayer’s superior record of hits made against hits conceded earned her second place ahead of Preis amongst those with 5 wins with Haß missing out on a chance of gold after an unexpected loss to 7th place finisher Ilona Vargha.
Ilek defended her title in 1948 and, at age 45, won the silver medal in 1952. Preis also returned to the Olympic arena for a further three appearances. Mayer, who was eventually stripped of her German citizenship, settled permanently in California before the outbreak of war but later returned to Germany where she died of cancer in 1952.

All matches at 36 holes.,na,"On Monday, September 19, 75 golfers teed off for the match play qualifying.  First player off the tee was Raymond Havemeyer, later donor of the Havemeyer Trophy given to the U.S. Amateur champion.  Qualifying medalists were Stu Stickney and Ralph McKittrick of the St. Louis Country Club, with a 36-hole total of 163, though McKittrick later defeated Stickney, 84-86, in a play-off for the medal.  A score of 183 was sufficient to move on to match play.  Only one of the three Canadians survived the qualifying, George Lyon of the Lambton Golf & Country Club in Toronto.
Match play began Tuesday and consisted of daily 36-hole matches.  Advancing to the semi-finals were Chandler Egan, Lyon, Frank Newton of the Seattle CC, and Burt McKinnie of the Normandie Park Golf Club in St. Louis.  McKinnie, a music teacher, was the current St. Louis city champion, while Newton was Pacific Northwest champion in 1902 and would win the first New England Amateur in 1926 at the age of 52.  Egan easily defeated McKinnie while Lyon bested Newton to move to the finals.
Egan was the favorite in the final based on his summer record, but Lyon was a fine player.  Before Lyon’s career was done he would win the Canadian Amateur eight times and finish second in both the U.S. Amateur and Canadian Open.  Lyon was known as one of Canada’s great all-round athletes, having been their top cricket batsman in the 1890s. After five straight days of 36 holes, one factor against him in the final, it was thought, was his age, 46.
The day of the finals dawned cold and gloomy and both contestants would fight the rain for the entire day.  When the battle was over, George Lyon was Olympic champion by 3 and 2.  His body, hardened by years of athletic endeavour, had pulled him through.  While Egan was a classic stylist, Lyon had an ungainly, flat swing, relying on his natural coordination and great strength, which made him easily the longest driver in the tournament.  After the match, Egan went to bed exhausted.  Lyon went to the awards dinner and further showed his stamina by walking the length of the dining room - on his hands! Egan and Lyon met again at a major tournament, in the second round of the 1906 US Amateur, where Egan was the two-time defending champion, but Lyon won again, in 20 holes.

The heavy gold medal favourite was Chloe Kim, who was unable to compete at Sochi 2014 because she was too young. In 2016, Kim became the first woman to land back-to-back 1080s in a halfpipe run and won double gold at the Youth Olympic Winter Games (slopestyle, halfpipe).
PyeongChang 2018 was American Kelly Clark’s fifth Olympic Games. At the age of 34, she was already the most decorated Olympic snowboarder ever with three career medals (one gold, two bronze) never having finished lower than fourth. The first to ever land the frontside 1080 in a competition, Clark was still one of the top women in the sport.
The rising American star in women’s halfpipe, Maddie Mastro was a consistent podium finisher all season long, winning an X-Games bronze medal. Named to the USA team for Sochi 2014, Arielle Gold injured her shoulder in practice and had to withdraw, but arrived in PyeongChang as the X-Games silver medalist.
The best of the rest included two Chinese three-time Olympians Cai Xuetong and Liu Jiayu, and Spain’s Queralt Castellet, competing at her fourth Olympic Winter Games.
The top qualifier going into the finals was Kim - a favourite with the home fans because of her South Korean parents. She wowed the crowd hitting back-to-back 1080s and had already secured gold with her first run score, but improved to win by eight-and-a-half points racking up the two highest scores in the final to become the youngest halfpipe medalist in Olympic Winter Games history.
Liu, the former world champion, earned 89.75 points in her second run of three to take the silver, winning the first medal for China at the Games. She also became the second Asian woman to win a snowboard medal at the Olympic Winter Games, after Japan’s Tomoka Takeuchi who won silver in the women’s parallel giant slalom at Sochi 2014.
Gold, who had to overcome the fear of getting hurt at Sochi 2014, dislocated her shoulder in practice in PyeongChang 2018, but pushed through to win bronze on her final run edging out her American teammate Clark.

He was expected to be challenged by Italy’s Ezio Gamba, runner-up at the 1979 Worlds, who was a soldier in the Italian Army. Italy did not boycott Moskva, but their soldiers were forbidden to compete. So Gamba dropped out of the Army and travelled to Moskva on his own, the only Italian judo player in 1980. In the early rounds, Adams looked unbeatable, winning all his matches by ippon. Gamba was less impressive but came thru to the final. The final was extremely close, but at the 7-minute limit, the referee called for hantei and both judges raised the white flag, indicating Gamba, who won the gold medal.

The Norwegians placed 1-2-3-6 in the 18 km. with Hagen in a clear lead, over 2 minutes ahead of Olaf Hoffsbakken and 3:36 ahead of the best non-Norwegian, František Šimůnek from Czechoslovakia in 4th place. However, at the 1935 World Championships, the Finn Lauri Valonen had taken 2nd place and the German Willy Bogner was 3rd in front of two Norwegians, due to good jumping results. In spite of moderate jumping results, the Norwegians once again claimed all the medals in Garmisch. Hagen and Hoffsbakken jumped safely and won the gold and silver easily by a clear margin. Sverre Brodahl was in trouble after a bad first jump measuring only 40 m., but was able to keep the winner of the ski jump Valonen behind in the fight for the bronze medal. Valonen had the best jumps in both rounds with 52 and 54.5 m., advancing from 26th place in the cross country to 4th place overall. The surprise man from the cross country part, Šimůnek, was able to stay ahead of the fourth Norwegian, Bernt Østerkløft, by only 0.5 points, ending 5th.
Oddbjørn Hagen ended his international skiing career in an impressive way, taking his third championship gold in a row. Germany had the second best jumper in the competition, but Toni Eisgruber was a mediocre cross country skier and ended as 23rd in the overall standings. Bogner’s 12th place was a disappointment for the Germans. Gustl Berauer, representing Czechoslovakia, ended up as 14th. He was a Sudeten-German, and after the German occupation of the Sudetenland in 1938, Berauer competed for Germany and became world champion in Nordic Combined at Zakopane in 1939.

One of those contenders, Carl Vinciquerra, the US national amateur champion was the victim of a major shock in the opening round, the unheralded Egyptian fighter Mohamed Amin defeating him on points.
The final matched Michelot with Germany’s Richard Vogt and at first it appeared as Vogt was to cruise to victory. The German’s superior reach dominated the first three minutes and he took the round clearly. It was then that Michelot put his experience to work, punishing Vogt for his overconfidence and changing the course of the fight. An attack by Vogt had Michelot reeling in the last few moments of the fight but the Frenchman had done enough to win the championship.
Vogt had a professional career with included three separate reigns as German light-heavyweight champion. An attempt at the European title was lost but he did have the distinction of being the man who ended the career of former heavyweight champion Max Schmeling.

Therefore it was decided to make a 25 km. track for the 50 km., to be skied in two laps, with the start and finish area moved into the forest, several kilometers away from the nearest dwellings. During the race the temperature was around zero, and the conditions were acceptable in spite of the thin layer of snow.
Early on it turned out to be a Finnish day. At the first lap Veli Saarinen was in the lead, one minute in front of his countryman Väinö Liikkanen, followed by Sweden’s Sven Utterström and three Norwegians: Arne Rustadstuen, Sigurd Vestad and Ole Hegge, who was 5th at the distance in St. Moritz four years earlier. Hegge had already lost five minutes to the leader Saarinen. On the second lap Utterström faded. At the end an exhausted Saarinen was able to cling to the lead ahead of fast finishing Liikkanen and won by a margin of 20 seconds. Hegge had the fastest second lap of all skiers, but was not able to catch Rustadstuen in the battle for the bronze medal.

In Sydney Scheidt led Ainslie by seven points going into the final race. The only way Ainslie could win was for Scheidt to finish 22nd or higher. Ainslie resolved to win by harassing Scheidt.

Slåttvik had emerged as Hasu’s closest rival, winning the prestigious Holmenkollen Nordic Combined both in 1950 and 1951 and beating Hasu on both occations. In 1950 is was a very close contest, but in 1951 Hasu fell in two of his three jumps and was out of contention for the victory. Slåttvik had now moved from his birthplace in Nordland to Lillehammer, which made it much easier for him to train and participate in important competitions.
At the Olympic Games in Oslo, the schedule of events for the Nordic Combined had changed. For the first time the ski jumping was the first part of the competition, and the 18 km cross-country part was scheduled the day after, and as usual combined with the specialist’s race.
The audience of almost 30,000 held their breath when home favorite Slåttvik fell in his first jump measuring 67.5 m, the longest in the first round. The two best jumps of three counted, and the pressure was on Slåttvik. He produced two excellent jumps in superb style and ended as winner of the jumping event, 0.5 point better than his countryman Sverre Stenersen, a 25-year-old newcomer to the team and like Slåttvik also from the northern part of Norway. Stenersen had the longest jump of the day, jumping 69.5 m in the third round. Hasu, however, jumped better than expected and placed fifth in the event. He had to beat Slåttvik by 4:32 minutes in the cross-country, and that was considered quite possible since Hasu was an excellent cross-country skier, a medal candidate among the specialists.
Hasu again made an excellent 18 km, missing the bronze medal among the specialist with only 4 seconds and beating his closest rival among the Nordic Combined participants, his countryman Paavo Korhonen, by over three minutes. Slåttvik, however, made his best cross-country competition ever. With massive support from an enthusiastic home crowd, he crossed the finish line with a time only 3:16 behind Hasu, placing third in the cross-country and winning the Olympic gold with a clear margin. Stenersen was able to keep ahead of Korhonen and secured the bronze, even if he was beaten by Hasu by over seven minutes.

This meant that the only World Champion at the Games was Chris Baillieu of Great Britain, one half of the 1977 championship duo and runner-up at the 1976 Olympics. Baillieu was considered a slight favorite, however, even without his traditional partner Mike Hart, because he had won three of the last four Double Challenge Sculls at the Henley Royal Regatta.

There were many explanations given, but the actual reasons are not known. Some said she was overcome by psychological pressure, driven too hard by her coach, while others said the rarified air of México had her struggling for oxygen. But with Nikolić out, the way was open for America’s Madeline Manning, who had won the 1967 AAU in 2:03.6. But the favorite’s in the final probably fell to Dutchwoman Mia Gommers.

Soviet Valery Borzov had shown promise when he won the 1968 European Junior double over 100/200. The next year he won the European 100, and in 1971 he won the sprint double at the European Championships. Borzov also posted a succession of top times and defeated several American sprinters in international dual meets. The top American coming since Mexico City was the 1968 200 metre silver medalist, John Carlos, but turned to pro football, and was ineligible due to amateur rules. He tried out for the Philadelphia Eagles and then played in Canada with the Montreal Alouettes. The US Olympic Trials put forward three good sprinters in Eddie Hart, Rey Robinson, and Robert Taylor. In the final of that event Hart and Robinson equaled the world record of 9.9.
In München all the favorites got thru the first round. The quarter-finals were later that day and the Americans went back to the Olympic Village to rest up. While there, they noticed something unusual while watching some of the events on television. It appeared that the 100 metre quarter-finals were beginning at the stadium – and they were not there! They rushed to the stadium, hoping to make it in time for their heats, but both Hart and Robinson were too late. Taylor was in the third heat and barely made it in time, qualifying for the semi-finals, just behind Borzov. The US Olympic Committee appealed the disqualification of Hart and Robinson, but to no avail – they were out. It turned out that US track coach Stan Wright was going by an outdated schedule that showed the quarter-finals starting at 6 PM (1800), instead of their actual 4 PM (1600) start time. With the two main Americans out, the road was clear for Borzov, although it is likely he would have won the gold medal even if they had run. He won fairly easily in the final with Taylor second, followed by 1968 silver medalist Lennox Miller. Three days later, Borzov ran in the 200 metre final, which was actually his best distance, and completed the sprint double, the first non-American to do that since Percy Williams (CAN) in 1928.

The snow conditions were difficult, as temperature changes forced most of the skiers to re-wax their skies up to three times during the race. The Swedes hoped to avenge their disappointing results in the short distance event. Their favorites were Gunnar Eriksson, World Champion in 1950 and the defending Olympic champion, Nils Karlsson.
At 13 km. World Champion Eriksson, who started eighth, was a clear leader, almost a minute ahead of two other early starters, Norwegians Harald Maartmann and Olav Økern. But Eriksson got into trouble with his skis and ended in 12th place. Økern, a veteran at 40-years-old, had spent over two years as a prisoner in Germany during the war. By 30,5 km. things had changed. The Finn Veikko Hakulinen, aged 27 but still a newcomer on the international scene, had taken the lead, 20 seconds faster than the Norwegian Magnar Estenstad. At 42 km. Hakulinen had increased his lead to 2:10, with Estenstad still in second position. The 33-year-old Finn Eero Kolehmainen had moved up to third position, 50 seconds behind Estenstad.
The first skier to finish was the first starter, Kalevi Mononen of Finland, but a few minutes later Økern was able to beat his time and take over the lead. Then Hakulinen finished in superb style with the famous final time of 3:33.33, bettering Økern’s time by over five minutes. Estenstad was able to keep ahead of Økern, but then the final starter, Kolehmainen, had a strong finish, beating Estenstad by 17 seconds and securing a Finnish double. The Finnish coach, Veli Saarinen had a well organized crew around the track, about 300 ”Finnish tourists”, including about seven with a radio. His team would regularly report snow conditions around the track, allowing for the optimal choice for re-waxing the skis (which might one minute to do, but would gain several minutes in ski time). Also, Saarinen was able to report tactics and split times to the skiers.

Holmlund could not hold the lead, as both Canadians passed her and Thompson held off Serwa for the gold medal, Holmlund taking bronze.

In the other semi-final, Germany outrode France with little challenge. The final saw Italy start very poorly as their four riders separated into two groups of two, four lengths apart, on an early lap. Few teams could recover from such a setback but they regrouped. They stayed within three lengths of the Germans for the first half of the race, and then put on the pressure, pulling away in the eighth lap, and eventually won by almost five seconds.  The Soviets won a close bronze medal race over the France. Great Britain had won the bronze medal in this event at every Olympics from 1928-56, but this time did not qualify for the quarter-finals.

The first round showed some excellent jumping. Kankkonen made the longest jump of the day, 95.5 m and had a 4.2 points lead over Engan, who did 93.5 m. Dieter Neuendorf was third, only 0.7 points ahead of the bronze medal winner from the Normal Hill, Torgeir Brandtzæg.
In the second round, with reduced runway length, Engan again made a stylish jump at 90.5 m. Kankkonen equalled Engan’s distance, but was penalized for a bad landing and was 1.8 points behind Engan. Brandtzæg advanced into bronze medal position after a 90 m jump, and was almost ten points ahead of the rest of the field. Engan, Kankkonen and Brandtzæg were all in a position to take the gold medal.
In the third round, the speed was again reduced. Brandtzæg, jumping first of the favorites, improved with another good jump at 87 m, but could not catch Engan and Kankkonen in the total points and had to settle for his second bronze medal. Engan, seemingly nervous, made a total miss at 73 m, but was still in the lead. Kankkonen had to make an 87-88 m jump with decent style points to pass Engan in the fight for the gold medal. The Finn made another excellent jump at 88 m, and seemed to have full control, but just after the landing he lost his balance and touched the snow with one of his hands. The jump was judged as a fall, and Engan had his revenge.
Engan was Norway’s first Olympic ski jumping champion in 12 years, and the Norwegians were back again as a major force in ski jumping. However, both Engan and Brandtzæg had short careers after their 1964 Olympic success. Later in 1964, during training two days before the Holmenkollen competition, Brandtzæg had a bad fall, while jumping 10 m longer than the hill record, and was severely injured. This fearless jumper tried a comeback the year after, but in spite of winning the national Large Hill Championships he felt he was not able to regain his former strength, and therefore decided to quit at the age of 23. After his great 1964- season Engan had two rather disappointing seasons. He was on the Norwegian 1966 World Championship team, and ended his career by coming 10th in the Large Hill Competition at the World Championships in Holmenkollen.

Dibiasi’s father, Carlo Dibiasi, had competed at the 1936 Olympics and trained him. Dibiasi would soon become known as the greatest platform diver ever, at least until Greg Louganis, as he would win the gold medal in this event at the next three Olympics, also adding World titles in 1973 and 1975.

A week before the Games, he had won the World Sprint Championships at West Allis by winning three of the four distances, including both 500 ms. Also in contention were Jan Ykema, a Dutchman who had won a World Cup race in Innsbruck, and Nick Thometz, who held the world record in the event since March 1987, with 37.55.
After Ykema had lowered the Olympic Record in the first pair, Dan Jansen was due to skate in the second heat. Just hours before the race, he had learned of the death of his sister, Jane, who had long suffered of leukemia. His family insisted that he start his race, but a distracted Jansen fell in the first curve and did not finish the race. The drama for Jansen would repeat itself a few days later, when he also fell in the 1,000 m.
Next up was Sergey Fokichev, the defending champion. Despite recording the fastest opener, his 36.82 would land him just outside the medals. These were taken by the skaters in pair four, Mey and Akira Kuroiwa. Mey had been runner-up behind Jansen at West Allis, while Kuroiwa was the 1983 and 1987 World Champion. Mey clearly beat his Japanese opponent and with 36.45, he lowered the world record by a tenth of a second. Kuroiwa was three tenths behind, and narrowly missed Ykema’s time with 36.77. While East Germany had taken many Olympic speed skating titles already, Mey was the first man from that country to do so.

She had lost the World Championship title in the last two years, first to Frida Svensson of Sweden in 2010, and then to Miroslava Knapková of the Czech Republic in 2011, both of whom were contenders for the gold medal in London. Kim Crow of Australia was a factor as well, as she elected to compete in both the single and double scull events at the 2012 Olympics, capturing silver in the latter race.
The three fastest times in the heats went to Zhang Xiuyun of China, an Olympic silver medalist in the double sculls from 1996, Knapková, and Fie Udby Erichsen of Denmark, a relative unknown. Crow picked up the fastest time in the quarterfinals, with Knapková just over a second on her heels and Erichsen again posting a surprise third-fastest time. By the semi-finals, however, it was Knapková who had earned the best time, followed by Erichsen and Crow, an order that remained through the final, where Knapková took the lead immediately and was untouchable for nearly the entire race; at the 1500m mark, she was over seven seconds ahead of the rest of the pack. Her Olympic rowing gold medal was the first for the Czech Republic since its 1993 independence. The race for silver came down to the wire, but Erichsen edged out Crow by approximately three-tenths of a second, giving Crow bronze, her second medal of the regatta.

All eyes were on Vezzali at London where she would attempt to win an unprecedented fourth successive Olympic title in the event. She was even chosen to carry the Italian flag at the Opening Ceremony.
The women’s foil proved a lot more predictable than the male equivalent and the semi-final line-up of three Italians and the Italian based Nam Hyeon-Hui of Korea exactly matched most of the predictions made before the Games.
The first semi-final matched Di Francisca and Nam and set the trend for the final matches of the tournament. The Italian was four points down with a minute to go but forced a tie in the dying seconds of the bout then won the sudden death decider. The second bout saw the dreams of Vezzali becoming a four time winner of the gold medal in foil end at the hands of her younger team mate Arianna Errigo by 15-12.
For most of the final it seemed that Errigo would defeat her more experienced compatriot Di Francisca.  With 45 seconds left on the clock Di Francisca needed to cancel a deficit of three points to remain in the gold medal hunt and that is exactly what she did by making three lightning fast hits to ensure the bout went to extra time. Di Francisca gambled on a swift attack at the sudden death phase and hit the golden jackpot within a second of the start of the extra period.
The bronze medal contest between Vezzali and Nam was nearly a carbon copy of the final but with the twist that the Italian veteran recovered from a slightly greater margin (four points) in a smaller period of time (18 seconds) to force extra time. A well timed counter attack from Vezzali then ensured that she took bronze and that Italy would make a sweep of the medals. This was the first Italy had swept the podium in any Olympic event since 1956.
Although Vezzali failed to become the first fencer to win four successive titles in any individual event she did win a record fifth successive medal in the discipline.

The groups were played by a single-elimination system.  The reason for four groups was to guarantee four semi-finalists, a situation which did not occur in wrestling nor in the men’s doubles.  A player who withdrew would then affect only the matches within the group.  According to the ancient Greek system for elimination tournaments, a new draw was made for each round with all the remaining participants.  If there was an odd number remaining someone would receive a bye.
Most of the results of the early matches are not known. John Pius Boland was a student at Christ’s College, Oxford in 1894 when he invited a Greek friend, Konstantinos Manos to speak at the Oxford Union.  Manos invited Boland to spend the 1896 Easter holiday in Greece during the Olympics.  Boland then entered the tennis tournament, although he was not a well-known tournament player.

Germany and Austria proved to be the most consistent teams with Marinus Kraus landing a 136.5 m jump and Thomas Diethart a 136.0 m jump, respectively, as their top athletes in the first round gave Germany a narrow lead of 2.5 points, with Japan in third place just 11.5 points behind.

But other major “skiing nations” had also not medaled in the men’s races, notably France, Italy, and Germany. The Austrians had won all the major titles since the last Olympics where Benjamin Raich won gold. Mario Matt, who failed to qualify for Vancouver, won the 2007 World Championships in Åre and Manfred Pranger was the 2009 World Champion in Val d’Isère. The 2009-10 season saw Reinfried Herbst, silver medalist from Torino, in the lead of the slalom World Cup after eight of nine races as he had won four times – in Levi, Alta Badia, Schladming, and Kranjska Gora. In second place was the winner at Adelboden, Julien Lizeroux, and in third was the winner in Wengen and runner-up in the 2008-09 slalom World Cup, Ivica Kostelić, while Giuliano Razzoli had won in Zagreb. Lizeroux also finished third in the 2008-09 World Cup and won silver at the 2009 World Championships. But Herbst was not favored in Vancouver due to the topography and the course, with the experts looking to Razzoli, whose Zagreb  win was on a similar course. Missing from Vancouver were top slalom specialists Rainer Schönfelder, the bronze medalist from Torino, and Jean-Baptiste Grange, both of whom were out with ACL tears.
Poor weather had caused all sorts of problems with other alpine skiing events, and foggy weather was prevalent throughout this, the last race in Whistler, although it was completed. After the first run Razzoli led in a time of 47.79 seconds with Mitja Valenčić (SLO) 0.43 seconds behind and Raich a further 0.11 seconds back. The early leader in the second run was the Canadian, Julien Cousineau, who at last gave the home crowd something to cheer about in the alpine events. His second run time of 51.07 was to be the second fastest time of the second run and his combined time of 1:40.66 would be good enough for 8th place. Cousineau held his lead until Andre Myhrer surpassed it with a second run of 50.73 (the quickest) and a combined time of 1:39.76. Kostelić, 4th after the first run, then had a good run to take the overall lead with a time of 1:39.48. Raich had a few minor errors, but it was enough to cost him time, finishing in 1:39.81 that was to be just outside the medals. Valenčić had a poor second run, eventually finishing down in 6th place. The last skier to go, Razzoli, held his nerve and, despite having a 0.58 second advantage over Kostelić after the first run, finished just 0.16 seconds ahead in a time of 1:39.32, so winning Italy’s only medal of the alpine skiing events.
Razzoli won the second gold medal at this Games for skiing manufactor Nordica, the same as used by bronze medalist Myhrer, while Kostelić trusted Fischer for silver. Raich and Marcel Hirscher, both just outside the medals, skied on Atomic and sixth placed Valenčić had the best finish in Vancouver for Elan. Finishing in 47th place was Kwame Nkrumah-Acheampong, known as The Snow Leopard, the first competitor from Ghana to compete in the Winter Games.

For the Olympics they returned to a more veteran lineup. Great Britain were bronze medallists at the 2019 Championships and served notice that they were a team to be reckoned with based on their victory in this year’s European Championship. Romania, silver medallists at the 2021 European Championships, and runner-ups at the 2019 Worlds, and Italy, winners of the recent World Cup III, also brought strong credentials to the event.
The favourites all went through to the finals, although Romania had to rely on the repêchage to get there, with the Netherlands and the United States joining them to round out the field. Australia and Great Britain had the fastest times in the heats, but it was Romania who broke out fastest to start the final. They were soon overtaken by the Australians, though, who forged to a boat length lead at the 700m mark. Great Britain then began to make a move, overtaking the Romanians, and setting their sights on the leaders. Unfortunately for them, in the closing stages their boat went a little crooked and, by the time they recovered, Romania and Italy passed them to take the silver and bronze respectively.

The home crowd certainly had reasons to expect a memorable day’s sport. The enigmatic Masahiko Harada held the world title at this event, Four Hills champion Kazuyoshi Funaki had already won a silver medal at these Games and the two other Japanese jumpers, Okabe and Saito, were also talented performers. The man who threatened to spoil the party for the hosts was the jumper who had already won on the smaller hill, Jani Soininen of Finland.
Whilst the Japanese occupied three of the first six places, the half way lead was taken by the 21-year-old Austrian Andreas Widhölzl, who had already impressed in taking third place in the K-90 competition. In sixth place, but apparently out of medal contention after the first round, was Harada but his second round leap was a monster. His jump was so long that he landed outside the range of the electronic measuring device and had to be measured manually. The competition could not wait and the last five jumps were taken before Harada’s score was processed. With the crowd at a fever pitch Funaki stepped up to take his jump and sailed out to 132.5 m and into the lead. Funaki also scored perfect 20.0 on style points from all five judges, the only time this has occurred at the Winter Olympics (through 2010), and one of only five times this has been accomplished in international ski jumping.
Soininen produced a respectable but not huge leap and could not overhaul Funaki.
Second-placed Okabe failed to leap within ten metres of his first attempt and slumped down the leader board, which left only Widhölz between Japan and Olympic gold.  The Austrian dropped well short of the required distance and a great cheer came from the home supporters as Funaki was recognized as champion. A few seconds later confirmation came that Harada’s giant leap had catapulted him into the bronze medal position.

After losing the gold due to an incorrect crossing at Vancouver, Kramer was looking for revenge, and his 5,000 m gold proved he was in shape. Kramer had also won the season’s only World Cup in this distance, although that race lacked his two main Dutch competitors, Jorrit Bergsma and Bob de Jong. Bergsma had beaten Kramer at the 2013 Worlds in Sochi, while De Jong - the 2006 champion - was competing in his fifth Olympics. Apart from the Dutchmen, defending Olympic champion Lee Seung-Hun and Belgian inline skater Bart Swings were considered for the medals. Several other contenders withdrew prior to the race. Russia’s Ivan Skobrev withdrew to focus on the team pursuit, as did the Norwegian entrants, who claimed the Dutch would be unbeatable. This earned the skaters a lot of criticism at home (from among others 1994 multiple Olympic champion Johann Olav Koss), especially after the bronze medal time turned out to be relatively weak and the Norwegian team failed to make the semi-finals in the team pursuit.
De Jong was the first of the favorites to skate, posting a stable and decent 13:07.19, but considering the track record stood 10 seconds faster, it seemed gold was out of the question. In the next pair, Bergsma and Swings raced each other. Bergsma departed with a 12:45 target time, which he managed with 12:44.45, a new lowland World Record and also a new Olympic Record. Swings had kept up with De Jong’s pace through 8,000 m, but eventually placed fifth. Bergsma’s time was comparable to Kramer’s 12:45.09 at the Dutch Olympic trials, which meant that the final pair would be exciting. Kramer took off a bit slower than Bergsma, but moved into first after 3,200 m. Kramer held on to his lead up until 3 laps before the finish, although gradually losing his lead in the previous laps. Knowing he couldn’t match Bergsma’s fast final laps, Kramer slowed down a little to finish second in 12:49.02. After the race, Kramer revealed he had been suffering from a recurring back injury since the Olympic 5,000 m. For the fourth time in Sochi, the speed skating podium was swept by Dutch skaters - a record in any winter sport.
Jorrit Bergsma had hoped to compete at the 2010 Olympics. Competing in the Dutch marathon skating circuit, with races of 40 km, his coach Jillert Anema noticed that Bergsma and several of his team mates should be able to beat the best team pursuit squads. As they were unable to enter the strong Dutch national team, Anema contacted the federation of Kazakhstan. Bergsma won the Kazakh national title in late 2009, but the necessary paperwork to also compete internationally was not completed in time, and Bergsma and his teammates gave up on their dream of Vancouver. Fortunately for Bergsma, his Olympic dreams still came through four years later.

Based on bodyweight, Nassiri won the gold medal and Földi silver. In 1972 at München they would reverse those positions, with Földi winning gold.

Thus, as with the rest of the women’s events, East Germany was lauded as the favorite, having won the last two editions of the tournament. The Soviet Union and the United States had been the runners-up in 1974 and 1975 respectively, while Romania had taken bronze on both occasions. The Soviet Union and East Germany won their heats in the opening round but, unlike most of the other events, there was no crew that was clearly dominant. The final, however, was slightly less competitive, with East Germany and the Soviet Union taking gold and silver by a comfortable margin.

Still, the nation had the top two seeds and its history of gold medal success in Olympic table tennis left them as the favorites for the top two spots. Zhang Jike, the reigning World Champion in both the singles and team events, was ranked number one while Wang Hao, the runner-up at the most recent World Championships and a two-time Olympic veteran with medals in the singles (silver in 2004 and 2008) and team (gold in 2008) events, was ranked number two. Wang was defeated in 2008’s all-China final by Ma Lin, but Ma had slipped in the rankings and a new rule from the International Table Tennis Federation, intended to curtail the nation’s dominance in the event, allowed for only two entrants per country in the tournament. This left Jun Mizutani of Japan, an Olympic veteran who had never won a major international singles medal, as the number three seed.
Both Zhang and Wang survived to the semi-finals, but Zhang struggled more along the way. While Wang gave up only two sets of fourteen, Zhang surrendered twice that many and, in a fourth round match against Bulgaria’s ninth-seeded Vladimir Samsonov, was at one point behind two sets to three. Zhang and Wang’s opponents in the semi-finals, eighth-seeded Dmitrij Ovtcharov of Germany and fifth-seeded Chuan Chih-Yuan of Chinese Taipei respectively, each fell in five sets, leading to the expected Chinese final. Despite his relative lackluster performance throughout the tournament, Zhang defeated Wang soundly and efficiently in the final, four sets to one, leading to an outcome that had seemed pre-ordained soon after the first set. The bronze medal match was somewhat more engaging, with Ovtcharov taking the first set and Chuan the next two. Ovtcharov then rallied, capturing the last three in mostly hard-won battles and earning the final podium spot. Although he had silver medals from the team events at the 2008 Summer Games and the 2010 and 2012 World Championships, his bronze in London was his first major international medal in the singles category.

The medal race went to Fletcher-Scott and Bithell with Burling/Tuke in third, and the Spanish crew back in seventh. That decided the medals, in that order. For Burling/Tuke it was a third consecutive medal in the event but a disappointing upset for the favored Kiwi crew.

By now, American riders were becoming more prominent internationally and the home course advantage and absent Eastern European riders led many to pick American riders as favorites. Davis Phinney was highly considered, as the best sprinter on the US team, but the course was a hilly one of 12 laps over 190.2 km., and Phinney, not a great climber, missed the winning break, eventually finishing fifth. American Alexi Grewal and Canadian Steve Bauer broke away on the penultimate lap.  Though they never had a large lead on the trailing Norwegian twosome of Dag Otto Lauritzen and Morten Saether, Grewal and Bauer were able to stay away to the finish. Bauer was considered the better sprinter but Grewal pipped him in the sprint by less than a wheel. Bauer later had a solid professional career, finishing fourth at the 1988 Tour de France, and wearing the yellow jersey in both 1988 and 1990. One rider who did not finish was Miguel Induráin, who from 1991-95 became the first cyclist to win the Tour de France in five consecutive years.
Grewal also turned professional but his career was less impressive. He won a few domestic races but never won in Europe in a major international race. Grewal’s mere participation in 1984 was controversial. He had tested positive only 10 days before the Olympics, after the Coors Classic in Colorado, for phenylethylamine, a stimulant. He was suspended for 30 days by the US Cycling Federation and dropped from the Olympic team. But Grewal appealed the suspension, noting that he took albuterol for asthma and the tests were not sophisticated enough to tell the difference between the two drugs.  Reinstated, he was able to race at Los Angeles.

The day of the race was warm and overcast, but a drizzle at the start turned into a steady rain throughout the race. This was not good news for Shorter, who did not like to run in the rain. Bill Rodgers pushed the early pace but he was running with an injured hamstring and would eventually fall back. At 25 km. the lead group included Shorter, Rodgers, Virén, Drayton, and a little-known East German former steeplechase runner, Waldemar Cierpinski. Shorter then put in a surge, attempting to drop the field, and only Cierpinski responded. At 30 km. it was Cierpinski who surged and Shorter could not match him. He gradually pulled away and won by almost 50 seconds. Shorter won the silver medal and the bronze went to the defending silver medalist, Belgium’s Karel Lismont.

In the United States, national championships were first held in 1886, and were continuous through 1968, at which time they were stopped. However, the United States Trampoline & Tumbling Association later reinstated tumbling nationals, sometime around 1971.
There were only four competitors in 1932 Olympic tumbling, which consisted of a compulsory and voluntary routine, with each routine lasting from 2-3 minutes. Three of the gymnasts were Americans and they won all the medals, led by Rowland Wolfe, who performed a backflip with two twists. The silver went to Ed Gross with Bill Hermann winning bronze, and Hungarian István Pelle, the all-around runner-up, placing a distant fourth, in an event which was likely strange to him.

But Karlstad’s recent results had been less impressive, and he had only managed a seventh spot in the 5,000 m. Gustafson, who had won the 10,000 m at the European Championships, had won the 5,000 m and was also the runner-up from Sarajevo 1984, when he had missed the gold medal by just 0.05.
First medal contender to hit the ice was Gerard Kemkers, bronze medalist in the 5,000 m. In lap five, he fell - unusual for a 10,000 m. Despite a quick recovery, he lost about 10 seconds. While that was still enough to beat the Olympic Record at that point, the fall almost certainly cost him a medal. The first to beat Kemkers’ time was his compatriot, Leo Visser. The silver medalist in the 5,000 m, he had beaten 14 minutes a month earlier at the Dutch distance championships. This time, Visser ended at 14:00.55, which seemed insufficient for the title. This was soon proven by Austrian skater Michael Hadschieff. He had earlier medalled in the 1,500 m, and stood out in Calgary for having a red extension of his suit cap over his eyes. This was to protect his contact lenses from the dry Calgary air. Less visible was a plastic board he wore under his suit to improve aerodynamic profile. This apparently worked, as Hadschieff, who had earlier lost the 1988 European Championship bronze because of a poor 10,000 m, now skated a new personal best of 13:56.11 to take the lead. With Geir Karlstad falling out of contention after 7km, this left only Gustafson to beat Hadschieff. But the Swede was clearly faster, eventually winning by 8 seconds, the largest victory margin of his three Olympic titles. It was long uncertain if he would also be able to beat Karlstad’s world record. In the end, he managed it by three tenths.
Another remarkable competitor was Yoshiyuki Shimizu of Japan. While he finished only 28th out of 32 competitors, he did impress onlookers by re-tying the laces of one of his skates, while continuing to race.

This was won by Sheridan by 7-3½ (2.23 m), throwing 127-10¼ (38.97) to Rose’s 120-6¾ (36.74).
Martin Sheridan was an Irish immigrant who was inspired to take up athletics by his brother Richard, who won the discus throw at the 1902 AAU championships.  Sheridan eventually became one of the great athletes of his time, setting several world discus records, winning nine Olympic medals (five gold), and three times winning the AAU title in the all-around championship.
For over 100 years, the result of this event has always been considered to be 1) Sheridan, 2) Rose. In 2015 Swedish researcher Tomas Magnusson discovered some 1905 US newspapers discussing the fact that Sheridan may have been disqualified. In August 1904 he competed at the Metropolitan AAU and his amateur status was questioned by officials Charles Sherrill and Matthew Halpin, based on the fact that he was the trackmaster at the Pelham Bay Park Athletic Grounds. The articles state that Sheridan was disqualified from his Olympic performances and Rose would become the winner of the discus throw. However, in future Spalding annuals, and all other records of Olympic results through the 1910s, Sheridan continued to be listed as the winner of this event. In addition, later stories about Sheridan note that he was “investigated and cleared by the AAU.” The IOC presumably never took any action on this problem.

Overall, the jury had to evaluate 40 literary works by 34 authors from 10 countries.
In the category Epic Works the gold medal was awarded to Hungarian Ferenc Mező for fragments of his book L’Histoire des Jeux Olympiques (History of Olympic Games). Mező was later an IOC member from 1948-61. He had not written a critical story, but a laudatory story of the ancient Olympic Games. The book was first published in 1929 in Budapest in Hungarian, and later in German editions in 1930 and 1935.
The silver medal was earned by German Ernst Weiß for his story Boetius von Orlamünde, which depicts the life of the beggar Boetius, his recalling and confirmation in the taming of his stallion Cyrus. The story was published in 1966 under the title The Aristocrat.
The bronze medal was won by the Dutch couple Margo Scharten-Antink and Carel Scharten for De Nar uit de Maremmen (The Fool of the Maremms). It describes the life story of a painter and also describes something somewhat “sporting“.

He had won three Olympic gold medals (1900, 1904, 1908), won seven AAU Championships (1897-99, 1901-02, 1906-07), and set 15 world records.  But since 1907 he had had competition from American Matt McGrath, who had finished second to Flanagan at the 1908 Olympics.
McGrath had one of the longest careers of any track & field athlete ever.  He finished second in the 1907 AAU Meet, and last competed in that meet in 1928, finishing fifth at 48 years old.  He competed in the Olympic hammer throw four times - 1908 (2nd), 1912 (1st), 1920 (5th), and 1924 (2nd).  He set two world records, one in 1907 and one in 1911.  At Stockholm, McGrath was absolutely dominant.  He won the event with 54.74, a margin of 6.35 metres over Canada’s Duncan Gillis.  McGrath had four measured throws, the shortest of which was 4.44 metres longer than Gillis’s best mark.

The distances were well off George Gray’s (CAN) world record of 14.32, but George Robertson, a British athlete who competed in the discus throw, noted that this was due to the size of the square, which “corresponded with no known rules, although the event was purported to be held under English rules.”

East and West Germany had placed third and fourth respectively, but they now sent a combined team to the Olympics. This meant the teams having placed fifth (Austria) and sixth (Norway) were called up to compete. The other four teams were host nation Spain, Asian champion and defending Olympic champion South Korea, Nigeria (Africa) and the US (Americas).
The Unified Team and Germany easily outplayed their pool opponents and qualified for the semi-finals. In pool B, South Korea soundly beat Norway, but was then held to a draw by Austria (17-17), which featured three former medallists from Yugoslavia and the USSR (Jasna Kolar-Merdan, Natalia Rusnatchenko and Slavica Djukić). As South Korea easily won its final game, the second semi-final spot was decided directly between Norway and Austria. In a tense match, the Norwegian women came out ahead, 19-17.
Both semi-finals were close matches. Germany lost narrowly to the South Koreans (26-25), while Norway beat the Unified Team only in the dying seconds, Siri Eftedal scoring the winning goal with just 3 seconds left on the clock. Compared to these matches, the final was a boring affair. After a brief lead early on, the Norwegians were outplayed by the Koreans, much as in the first pool match. The final score, 28-21 gave Korea its second consecutive gold medal. As the Unified Team defeated Germany, the podium was essentially the same as in 1988.

Brazil and the United States were both drawn in Group A, along with Korea, and all three teams finished with group records of 3 wins and 1 loss. But Korea lost out on point ratios, and Brazil and the US advanced to the semis, joined by Italy and Canada from the Group B, which was a major upset as they had defeated a tough Japanese team.

The top seeded fighter was the Indian soldier Amit Panghal, a measure of the country’s improvement in the sport throughout the 21st century, though limited competition and a run of surprise results in what few tournaments that had taken place meant the seeding process was not always to be relied on.

The finish was very close, with Sadovy outtouching Perkins to win in 3:45.00, well under the world record, Perkins finishing in 3:45.16. Even Holmertz finished in 3:46.77, just off the old world mark.
Sadovy would add another gold medal in the 4 x 200 free relay in Barcelona, finishing with three gold medals in his only Olympic appearance, and his only three events. Russian freestylers starred in 1992, winning the 50 and 100 free (Aleksandr Popov), and 200 and 400 free by Sadovy. Sadovy had a short career. He won relay gold medals at the 1993 European Championships, and then retired in 1996 after not making the Russian Olympic team for Atlanta.
Perkins would later win the 1,500 in Barcelona, defending that title in Atlanta, and add a 1,500 silver in Sydney. At the 1994 World Championships, he would win the title, bettering Sadovy’s world record with 3:43.80. Anders Holmertz competed at four Olympics (1984-96) but was never able to get to the top step of the podium, winning four silver and one bronze medal.

In rounds two and three, he improved with 8.56 (28-1) and 8.52 (27-11½), the second round 8.56 (28-1) wind-aided. Those were good enough for the gold medal. But getting ready for the fourth round, a new official told Lewis he now had to jump first, not last. He argued that he should be given extra time to recover from his third-round jump, but was rebuffed. A long jump clock malfunction gave him some extra time and he responded with 8.72 (28-7½), winning the event easily with a dominant series.

Meanwhile, one of the defending Olympic champions, Katherine Copeland of Great Britain, had also had her share of success in the intervening years, winning the 2015 European Championships and coming in as runner-up at the 2015 World Championships, the latter with her partner in Rio Charlotte Taylor. Several other nations had found varying success in the event over the last four years, which amplified the chances that there would be strong competition at the 2016 Games. Of particular note was the Dutch duo of Ilse Paulis and Maaike Head, who earlier that year had won the European Championships and set a world record.
The Dutch continued their strong performance in the heats, posting the only sub-seven minute time, while Great Britain was eliminated surprisingly in the repêchage. The Netherlands again had the fastest time in the semifinals, while the South African pair of Kirsten McCann and Ursula Grobler, the 2015 World bronze medalists, edged out MacKenzie and Edward to claim victory in the other semifinal. Neither South Africa or New Zealand posted a serious challenge in the finals, however, which were won fairly handily by the Dutch. Silver went to Canadians Lindsay Jennerich and Patricia Obee, the 2011 and 2014 World runners-up; Jennerich was also a 2010 World Champion in the event.

The Grand Challenge Cup at the Henley Regatta had been won in 1910 and 1911 by a Magdalen College (Oxford) crew.  In 1909 that title had been won by the Belgian crew from the Royal Club Nautique de Gand.  Unfortunately the Gand crew was not at Stockholm, nor was Magdalen College.  The British were represented by New College (Oxford), and the Leander Club, although most of the Leander rowers were from Magdalen College (Oxford).  Canada did send a Toronto Argonauts eight, which had won the 1911 championships at the National Association of Amateur Oarsmen.
In a bad draw, Leander and the Argonauts were drawn against each other in round one, with Leander narrowly defeating the Toronto crew.  Leander also survived close races against Australasia in the quarters (by less than a boat length) and Germany in the semis.  On the other hand, the New College crew had a relatively easy time of it, winning the first two rounds handily against Norway and Sweden, and receiving a bye in the semi-finals.
The final was closely fought.  The two boats were even for 1,000 metres, when Leander pulled ahead before the series of turns.  They were never caught, eventually winning by about one length.  Leander was awarded possession of the Challenge Trophy for the coxed eights event, which had been donated in 1908 by the Italian Count and IOC Member, Eugenio Brunetta d’Usseaux.
The final was noteworthy for a controversy that developed in the choice of lanes, which has engendered a tradition at New College Boat Club to this day. The finalists’ captains were to toss to choose lanes, which was won by New College. Tradition had it that they were to offer the choice of lanes to Leander, who, by tradition, were supposed to refuse the offer, allowing New College to have their choice. However, the Leander/Magdalen captain accepted the offer, choosing the better lane.
At the medal ceremony, Sweden’s King Gustav V expressed his dismay over the ungentlemanly conduct by Leander/Magdalen, and presented his colors to New College. Since that time, New College Boat Club has raced in purple and gold, the colors of Sweden’s Royal House. New College has also adopted the tradition of toasting to “God damn bloody Magdalen,” which the 1912 New College stroke, Robert Bourne, supposedly said as the crossed the line in Stockholm in second pace. On the letterhead of the New College Boat Club, into the 21st century, can be found the abbreviaton “GDBM”.

Also an excellent competitive jumper, he was heavily favored going into Montréal though he lost popularity with the local crowd by making  unkind remarks about French-Canadians before the competition. But the final was held on a cool, rainy day, and Stones technique demanded great speed in his take-off – he hated to jump in the rain. After 2.21 (7-3) in the final only four jumpers remained, with Stones in second, trailing the surprising Jacek Wszoła of Poland. Wszoła then got over 2.23 (7-3¾) on his first attempt, as did Canada’s Greg Joy, to the delight of the Montréal crowd. Stones failed at that height and had to settle for his second consecutive bronze medal. Wszoła and Joy both cleared 2.25 (7-4½), the Pole in his second attempt and the Canadian on his third, settling gold and silver. It was a rare success for Canada in what proved a difficult track and field programme for them. Wszoła beat the record of Charlie Dumas from 1956 to become the youngest Olympic champion in this discipline.

The frenzy would only get more intense. The two-time defending champion was Ethiopian Kenenisa Bekele but he had had a difficult year with injuries and his form was not known coming into London. Britain posted their hopes on Mo Farah, silver medalist in the event at the 2011 World Championships. Farah would run together with his training partner, American Galen Rupp, both of them coached by 1984 Olympian and former marathon world-record golder Alberto Salazar.
Farah and Rupp wanted a slow pace and to kick off it, but the other finalists must not have heard that. Bekele ran 65.2 for the opening lap but then jogged through the second in 73.2 and the third lap was even slower. The pace was lethargic with 5K passed only in 14:05.79. It was only in the final three laps that the pace quickened with Farah taking the lead at the bell. He led throughout the final laps as the African runners could not get to him. On the final turn, Rupp moved into third and on the final straight he outsprinted Ethiopian Tariku Bekele to win silver behind Farah, who ran 53.4 for his final lap. The Olympic Stadium rocked for the third British gold in only a few hours.
Farah would come back seven days later to win the distance double of 5/10K. Rupp’s medal in the 10K was the first for an American since Billy Mills had won the event at the 1964 Olympics. Kenenisa Bekele trailed back in fourth in his attempt to three-peat.

The Swedish team was still lead by Sixten Jernberg, now close to 35 but still considered as one of the best long distance skiers. Janne Stefansson, silver medallist at the distance in the World Championships 1962, was also considered among the favorites, together with Italian Giulio De Florian, bronze medalist in 1962. De Florian however had to withdraw from the 30 km due to illness.

The first of the four to fall was Wolke although his exit at the hands of Correa was due to a cut eye that happened in the second round of an otherwise even contest. The Cuban then eliminated Valdez in the semi-finals with 3-2 points decision after a desperately close contest to set up a meeting with Kajdi in the final. While the Hungarian was recognized as the most skillful boxer it was the strength of Correa that proved the dominant factor in their meeting and, despite the Cuban being forced to take a standing count in the first round, the judges unanimously voted Correa as the new Olympic champion.
Correa won the welterweight title at the first World Amateur Championships in 1974 but failed to retain either his Pan American Games or Olympic titles and retired in 1979.

Schumann would dominate this event in the coming years, winning the gold again in 1996 and 2004.

The reigning World Champions were Romania’s Haralambie Ivanov and Vasile Nicoară, the latter of whom was also among the most recent European champions. East Germany, meanwhile, was the reigning European and World runner-up, but competed under the banner of unified Germany, which sent West Germans Heinz Büker and Holger Zander instead. Romania won its heat in the fastest time in the opening round, although it encountered a surprising challenge from the Dutch crew, Toon Geurts and Paul Hoekstra, who finished only 0.10 seconds later. Germany, meanwhile, won its own heat comfortably. Sweden, meanwhile, was the fastest in the semi-finals, with Romania and the Netherlands taking the other two heats. The final was fairly well spaced out by the end, with Sweden winning gold, the Netherlands taking silver, and Germany capturing bronze ahead of Romania, who finished a surprising fourth and off the podium.

He would later win gold medals at the 1959, 1961, and 1962 World Championships, as a welterweight. He also won gold at the 1958 Asian Games in the lightweight class.

Ties broken by lightest bodyweight.,na,"Unlike the World Championships, there was no weight class up to 89 kg contested at the Olympics. As a result, this created the biggest gap between two weight divisions with a 15 kg difference from light-heavyweight (81 kg) and middle-heavyweight (96 kg). The two world record holders in this class Sohrab Moradi, season best 384 kg, and Tian Tao, qualification best 410 kg, were absent in Tokyo. Moradi, the holder of the snatch (186 kg) and total (416 kg) record, did not qualify whereas Tian, record holder in clean & jerk (231 kg), missed the Games due to an elbow injury. Tian was the reigning world champion and also the back-to-back winner of the last two Asian championships. Their absence made the best qualifiers for this event Fares Ibrahim with 404 kg, and Yauhen Tsikhantsou with 400 kg, but both set these results back in 2019. In that year Ibrahim won silver at the World Championships, and Tsikhantsou was the European champion and also world champion in the 102 kg class. Both men had not competed in the 96 kg class since late 2019, and Tsikhantsou had not participated in any event since then. Ibrahim finished second in the 102 kg class at the 2020 Asian championships, held in April 2021. As Jhonatan Rivas (COL), season best 393 kg, missed the Games following the Colombian Weightlifting Federation being sanctioned due to the high number of doping offences, the competitors in Tokyo with the season bests were the reigning European champion Anton Pliesnoi with 393 kg, Boady Santavy 389 kg, and Keydomar Vallenilla 384 kg.
After the snatch the first five lifters were packed together within 2 kg of each other. Santavy led the field with 178 kg followed by Vallenilla, Ibrahim, and Pliesnoi with 177 kg each, and then Chen Po-Jen with 176 kg. Chen was the only one to attempt 180 kg, but failed. Of the top five, Santavy ended his clean & jerk attempts first, with a final lift of 208 kg, which moved him into first place, but when Vallenilla and Pliesnoi both cleared 210 kg for a total of 387 kg they both overtook Santavy by 1 kg. Chen failed to lift 211 kg in his last attempt and was out of the medals, while Vallenilla, already in first place, tried to improve his total with 215 and 216 kg, respectively, but missed both. Ibrahim then started his clean & jerk attempts and he secured gold with his first try following a 217 kg lift, which he improved to 225 kg in the second lift. His 232 kg in the third attempt would have been a world record, but he did not make it.
Ibrahim’s gold medal was still historical, as it was the first ever Olympic gold medal for Qatar. With Bekdoolot Rasulbekov finishing sixth he achieved Kyrgyzstan’s best ever Olympic weightlifting result. Finishing tenth in this event was Cyrille Tchatchet II who represented the Refugee Olympic Team after being invited by the IOC. Also present was Palestine’s first ever Olympic weightlifter Mohammed Hamada, who had received a Tripartite Commission Invitation.

The leader thru the first three rounds was Soviet Aleksandra Chudina, who leapt 5.99 (19-8) in the first round and had her best mark of 6.14 (20-1¾) in round two.

Tufte was the 2001 and 2003 champion and the 2002 bronze medalist, Hacker was the 2002 champion and the 2003 runner-up (as well as the 2000 Olympic bronze medalist and winner of the 1999 and 2004 Diamond Challenge Sculls at the Henley Royal Regatta), and Čop was the 2001 and 2002 runner-up and the 2003 bronze medalist. The odd one out was Václav Chalupa, Jr., bronze medalist in 2001 and Olympic runner-up in 1992. Čop elected to try and defend his title in the double sculls in Athens, leaving Davor Mizerit to represent his nation in the singles. Meanwhile, defending Olympic champion Rob Waddell of New Zealand had retired from rowing to try his hand at sailing, while 1996 Olympic champion and 2000 runner-up Xeno Müller of Switzerland had retired, leaving Tufte and Hacker as the favorites at the 2004 Summer Olympics.
The opening heats were won by Tufte (who posted the fastest time of the round), Chalupa, Belgium’s Tim Maeyens, and Santiago Fernández of Argentina, the latter of whom was the reigning Pan American runner-up. The semi-finals, meanwhile, were taken by Chalupa, Tufte, and Estonia’s Jüri Jaanson, while Mizerit and Hacker were eliminated in favor of Fernández and Ivo Yanakiev of Bulgaria. Jaanson had been the World Champion in 1990, but had not seen the podium at that tournament since being runner-up in 1995. In the final, he put out an impressive effort, but was unable to outperform Tufte, who won gold comfortably, leaving the Estonian with silver. Yanakiev crossed the finish line shortly thereafter to take the bronze medal. Jaanson’s medal was not only the first for Estonia in rowing, but his first in five editions of the Olympics, as he débuted in 1988 for the Soviet Union.

This still did not guarantee a very broad field of top nations, as three spots were reserved for continental champions (China, Ivory Coast and the US), and one for the host nation (South Korea). The remaining four places were earned at the 1986 World Championships (Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia and Norway) and the 1987 B World Championships (Yugoslavia).
The South Koreans had been in preparation for the tournament for years, training under isolated, Spartan conditions. This had not yet resulted in fame at the 1986 Worlds (12th), but paid off at the Olympics. They started off with a win against Czechoslovakia, but subsequently lost to Yugoslavia. Their win against the US secured Korea’s spot in the final pool, but they would carry their lost match into the final pool. In the other group, Norway and the USSR easily held off China and Ivory Coast, and drew 19-19 to both qualify for the next round.
In that tense final group, the Soviets first defeated Yugoslavia, while Korea beat Norway. This meant three teams were still in a position to win the gold, and even Norway could still claim the silver medal. The Norwegian women pulled away from Yugoslavia 20-15, meaning they had secured at least a bronze. The unofficial final match between South Korea and the USSR was sold out, filled with enthusiastic Korean supporters. The agile Koreans pulled up to a 16-12 lead, but saw it disappear as the Soviets scored five times in a row to take the lead, 17-16. In a last-ditch effort, the hosts managed to come back in to the game, winning it 21-19 in front of an ecstatic crowd. The Soviet women fell back to third, as the Norwegian team claimed its first Olympic medal in the sport.

This was mostly of consequence for the Eastern European teams, which all played with state sponsored amateurs, and title defender Hungary had to leave several of their star players at home. When the draw for the tournament was published, Morocco withdrew its team, refusing to play against Israel. They were replaced by Ghana. The Israeli team was unlucky to be eliminated in the quarter-finals. Following a 1-1 draw after overtime with Bulgaria, lots were drawn to decide the winner, as had been the case in the 1960 Olympic semi-final. Bulgaria proceeded to eliminate the home team in the semi-finals. Hungary meanwhile defeated the tournament’s surprise, the Japanese squad that eventually took home the bronze medal.
The final was a disgrace to football. The Hungarians were leading by 2-1 when Bulgaria’s Dimitrov was sent off for a tackle from behind. A second expulsion soon followed, when Ivkov committed a rough offense. This angered Khristov, who shot the ball towards Mexican referee De Leo. While De Leo could not see the offender, the linesman was paying attention. Khristov was also removed from play, leaving the Bulgarians with only eight. Hungary easily won the match 4-1, although they did not finish unscathed either, Juhász following the three Bulgarians into the dressing rooms before the final whistle.
