Ties broken by lightest bodyweight.,na,"Greek Pyrros Dimas and German Marc Huster were expected to resume their battle for the gold medal in this class. They had placed 1-2 in 1996 and at the 1998 World Championships, and were 2-3 at the 1999 Worlds, when they were upset by Iranian Shahin Nassiri Nia. Dimas had won this gold medal in both 1992 and 1996.
Nassiri Nia went out early in Sydney when he dislocated his shoulder on his first snatch attempt. Dimas missed his first two snatch attempts, but then succeeded on 175.0 kg, below his goal of 185, which left him trailing Huster, who had lifted 177.5 kg. The leader after the snatch was Georgian Giorgi Asanidze with 180.0 kg. When Dimas lifted 215.0 kg in the clean & jerk, this gave him 390.0 kg, a total matched by Huster and Asanidze. The medals were decided on bodyweight, with Dimas weighting 84.06 kg, Huster 84.22 kg, and Asanidze 84.70 kg.
Dimas’ third Olympic weightlifting gold medal equalled the mark set by Turkey’s Naim Süleymanoğlu in 1988-96, although it would later be equalled in Sydney by Dimas’ teammate Akakios Kakiasvili, and in 2004 by Turkey’s Halil Mutlu. Only Dimas and Süleymanoğlu won their three gold medals in the same class. Dimas returned in 2004 and won a bronze medal in the light-heavyweight class, his fourth Olympic weightlifting medal equalling the mark set by American Norb Schemansky (1948-64) and German Ronny Weller in Sydney (1988-2000), but Dimas is the only Olympic weightlifter to win four medals in the same class.

1020,"3,000 metres, Women",1964 Winter Olympics,37,Speed Skating,/editions/37/sports/SSK, 2 February 1964 — 13:25,"Eisschnellaufbahn im Olympiaeisstadion, Innsbruck",28 from 13 countries,na,na,"Prior to the 1963-64 season, it was felt that only one woman could challenge Lidiya Skoblikova in the longer distances and that woman was her teammate, Inga Voronina. Voronina had won the 1,500 at the 1962 World Championships, and the 3,000 at the 1961 and 1962 Worlds, and held the world record of 5:06.0, set at Medeo in 1962. But she was not in Innsbruck, not being chosen for the Soviet team due to a stomach ailment. In her absence, the gold was conceded to Skoblikova, who had won the 1963 World Championships, and won all four distances on her way to the title. She was the defending champion and had already won the previous three gold medals in Innsbruck.
The best “other” skater in Voronina’s absence was Valentina Stenina, wife of top male skater Boris Stenin. She had won the 1961 World Championships, and had placed second in the 3,000 at multiple internationals since 1960, always to Skoblikova or Voronina. Stenina started in the fourth pair and took an early lead with 5:18.5. Three pairs later, Skoblikova was up and recorded 5:14.9 to take a lead that everyone expected to hold up, and it did. In the 12th pair, Soviet skater Klara Nesterova finished in 5:22.5 to move into third, and the podium positions seemed set. Or so it seemed. But in the final pair, the 14th, North Korean skater Han Pil-hwa, whose country was making its Olympic début at Innsbruck, started at what appeared to be a crazy pace. A virtual unknown, although she had competed at the 1963 World Championships, thru 1,800 metres she was on the same pace as Skoblikova. She could not hang on to that speed, but finished in 5:18.5 to tie Stenina and knock Nesterova off the podium.
For Skoblikova, it was a clean sweep of all four gold medals in Innsbruck, and added to her two from Squaw Valley, gave her six Olympic gold medals, still a speed skating record, for women or men, thru the 2006 Winter Olympics. The feat has never been duplicated by women, although in 1980, Eric Heiden would win all five men’s events. In fact, only one other woman, Yvonne van Gennip in 1988, has won three gold medals at a single Olympics since. A few weeks after Innsbruck, Skoblikova would repeat her feat, winning all four distances as she won the 1964 World Championships. As for Han, she would prove this was not a fluke. She competed internationally through the 1972 Winter Olympics, and would place third at the distance at the 1966 World Championships, and was fifth all-around at the 1965 Worlds.

She had competed at the 2004 Olympics, failing to make the final, and then failed to make the US team for the 2008 Olympics. However, she was world ranked #1 in both 2010 and 2011. The best time of the year had been posted by Russian Nataliya Antyukh, but her teammate Irina Davydova was more highly considered before the Games. However, Davydova did not get out of the semis, placing fifth in the second heat. Defending champion Melaine Walker of Jamaica was also considered a contender, but she also flopped in the semis, placing sixth in her heat.
The final came down to Demus against Antyukh, with Demus leading through the first five hurdles. But Antyukh had more at the end and took the lead just before the ninth hurdle. The two ran closely to the finish but Demus could not gain back ground and Antyukh won the gold medal. The bronze went to Czech Zuzana Hejnová, a consistent hurdler in 2012, who finished quickly on the final straight. Antyukh had started her career as a 400 hurdler but then switched to the open 400, only to return to the intermediates after failing to make the 2008 Olympic team.
However, in December 2022 re-tests of Antyukh’s urine samples from 2012 caused her to be disqualified by the Athletics Integrity Unit, and her gold medal was rescinded. In March 2023 the IOC Executive Board announced medal re-allocations with Lashinda Demus advancing to the gold medal, Zuzana Hejnová advancing to silver, and Jamaica’s Kaliese Spencer receiving the bronze medal.

As the 2019 World Champion he was also favored in the short butterfly, where he had broken Michael Phelps’s world record in the event by swimming 49.50. At the US Olympic Trials Dressel recorded the third fastest time ever with 49.76 and came into Tokyo with 7 of the top 10 times in the event.
Hungary’s Kristóf Milak, who was considered better in the 200 fly, was the only swimmer close to Dressel on time but still had never broken 50 seconds. Another challenger was France’s Mehdy Metella but he had had shoulder injuries and would not make the final.
In the prelims Dressel equalled Joseph Schooling’s Olympic record from Rio, leading the way with 50.39. He then bettered that in the semi-finals with a time of 49.71 as Milak qualified second with 50.31. The final saw Dressel out the fastest, splitting 23.00 with Milak and ROC swimmer Andrey Minakov 0.65 seconds back at the turn. Dressel slowed slightly coming in but still broke his own world record with a time of 49.45 as Milak closed quickly to finish in a European record 49.68, making him the second fastest performer ever. Behind them Minakov could not hold on as Swiss swimmer Noe Ponti took bronze.
For Dressel this was his second individual gold at Tokyo. He would later win the 50 freestyle, and help the United States win the men’s 4 x 100 free relay and the mixed medley relay to leave Tokyo with five gold medals.

He briefly retired but came back to place second at the 1951 World Championships in the sprint. A few months before the Helsinki Olympics, Mockridge competed at the Grand Prix de Paris sprint title, the world’s top invitational event, and became the first amateur to win the open title at that event. He did not race in the sprint at Helsinki, choosing to concentrate on the time trial and the tandem. In the kilo, starting 20th, he won easily, with a margin of 1.6 seconds over Italy’s Marino Morettini, who was the next-to-last to start. Mockridge would return to win a second gold medal in the tandem, accompanied by Lionel Cox. With Mockridge not in the event, Cox would also win a silver in the match sprint. Morettini had been third in the sprint at the 1951 World Championships, would place second in that event in 1952, and became World Champion in 1953.

The qualification points were added together from competition results between January and August 2015. Five continental championships afforded twenty places each per gender: one each from Africa and Oceania, five from Asia, eight from Europe, and five from the Americas with a maximum of one quota per NOC. Other athletes who qualified were the winner of the 2015 UIPM World Cup final plus the top three finishers at the World Championships in Berlin. Also qualified were the top three ranked athletes at the 2016 UIPM World Championships not previously qualified, plus the six highest ranked athletes not already qualified as per the world ranking list at 1 June 2016. Finally, the host nation, Brazil, had been guaranteed a single place each in the men’s and women’s events. Two wild cards were allocated by the UIPM.
The show jumping event threw the competition wide open, with six athletes out of contention because of repeated refusals. This included former gold medalists Lena Schöneborn and Laura Asadauskaitė of Lithuania. The Cuban Leydi Moya required medical treatment after a severe fall, but continued to participate in the combined event. In international competitions, there are rarely more than two eliminations per show jumping event.
Gold medal favorite Schöneborn finished second in the fencing event and had a great chance to collect her second gold medal until the riding ended her hopes. The same applied to Asadauskaitė. However, Chloe Esposito from Australia was seventh with a handicap of 45 seconds going into the last event, but with a strong performance in the combined she claimed the gold medal. Modern Pentathlon is certainly a family affair for the Espositos. Chloe’s father and coach Daniel competed at the 1984 Los Angeles Games, while she was joined by her younger brother Max in Rio. Her sister Emily was a shooter who competed at the 2010 Youth Olympics in Singapore and at the 2014 Commonwealth Games.

The event was absolutely dominated by the Buffalo German YMCA who won games by such scores at 97-8, 77-6, and 105-50.   The Buffalo Germans were the greatest basketball team of that era and were later enshrined in the Basketball Hall of Fame as a team.  They had won the Pan-American Exposition in 1901 and had not been defeated since that time.
Donald Sayenga has written about the famous Buffalo German YMCA team, which was later inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame as a team.  Portions of his article are as follows:
“The Buffalo Germans were a very small group of German-speaking men who played together as one of several teams sponsored by the Buffalo (New York) Young Men’s Christian Association (YMCA).  The new Buffalo Central YMCA (which opened in 1903) was a huge organization with thousands of members, one of the world’s largest YMCA associations.
“The famous Buffalo Germans basketball team had carried away all honors at the Pan-American Exposition [in 1901].  At that Exposition eight of the country’s leading basketball teams were entered in competition and the Buffalo Germans won the championship by defeating all of the others.  They scored a total of 81 points in the tournament to their opponents’ 27.  This is more remarkable because the average age of this team in the Pan-American year was only 18.
“Following their Olympic triumph, the team manager arranged a country-wide tour which included the playing of 87 games and of these they won 69 and lost 18.  In 1907 the team started the greatest winning streak of their career, playing 111 games from then through the season of 1910-11 without a single loss.  During all these years the team included only nine different men and they carried only six on their tours.  This great team began its career in the gymnasium of the German department of the Buffalo YMCA and played games and practised there until 1905.  An unfortunate misunderstanding with the administration of the German department forced them to leave the YMCA just as they were beginning the greatest years of their career.  They reluctantly moved across the street to Orioles Hall and continued there for the rest of their career.  In retrospect, it seems that the YMCA gave up a tremendous asset through this action.
“The Buffalo Germans represent a rare case of a whole team which has been inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame.  As single individuals, however, they remain obscure.  Historian William G. Mokray credits the Buffalo Germans as perhaps being the first great professional basketball team.”
However, the basketball events in the 1904 Olympics are hardly of Olympic caliber.  No foreign teams entered or competed.  The championship doubled as the AAU Championship for 1904.  In addition, restrictions on team events at the 1904 Olympics put severe restrictions on many foreign countries entering teams.  It was required that the athletes not only represent a single country but that they all be members of the same club.  This rarely happened with foreign teams.  Finally, in 1904, there were essentially no foreign countries playing basketball.  For these reasons we do not consider the basketball events of the 1904 World’s Fair as part of the Olympic Games, but only list them as a demonstration sport and is this decision is shared by most Olympic historians.

Since Palusalu had already defeated Nyman earlier in the tournament, this gave the gold medal to Palusalu, with Nyman winning silver and Hornfischer bronze.
Palusalu had only previously competed in one international event, the 1933 European Greco-Roman Championships, in which he placed fourth. He had already won five Estonian titles in freestyle and four in Greco-Roman by the time of the 1936 Olympics. In Berlin he made history by winning the heavyweight class in both freestyle and Greco-Roman, the only time this has ever happened, making him the absolute champion wrestler of the year. In 1937 he won the European title in Greco-Roman before retiring in 1938 due to a shoulder injury. In 1991 Palusalu was voted the greatest Estonian athlete of all-time.

Their lineup included former Olympic medalists Antonina Zelikovich, who had captured silver in the 1980 single sculls and the 1988 quadruple sculls, and Yelena Khloptseva, a 1980 Olympic champion in the double sculls.
Germany, as expected, dominated the tournament, winning both the opening round and the final by margins greater than four seconds, the latter in Olympic record time. The Unified Team won the other heat, but the Romanians, bronze medalists at the most recent World Championships, had a faster time. Romania had brought two of their 1988 Olympic medalists to this event: Veronica Cochelea, silver and bronze medalist in the double and quadruple sculls respectively, and Anişoara Dobre, another quadruple sculling bronze medalist. In the final, Romania was able to outperform the Unified Team and captured silver, while the former Soviets settled for bronze, albeit over seven seconds ahead of their nearest competitors, the Dutch. Cochelea’s silver medal was not her only one of the Games: she also came in second in the double sculls with Elisabeta Lipă.

Fleming would become the first real American figure skating star. Though Tenley Albright and Carol Heiss had both won gold medals, they were really before, or at the dawn, of television. Fleming used her skating fame and good looks to launch a professional ice show career and a television career. Seyfert was the first great East German skater – she would win the next two World Championships after Fleming turned. Mašková, known as one of the first great jumpers, turned pro and skated in Holiday on Ice. She was tragically killed in a car crash in March 1972.

The sabre competition was missing the Hungarian fencers, because their country was not invited to the Olympics due to their role in World War I.  Hungarian fencers had dominated the sabre events at London in 1908 and Stockholm in 1912.  Hungary remained the dominant nation in sabre fencing through 1968.

In Hungary’s absence, Italy won the team sabre event in 1920.

Fréchette was expected to open a lead in the technical figures and had to maintain that lead. But in that segment, Brazilian judge Maria de Silveira gave Fréchette an unaccountably low score of 8.7. De Silveira maintained that she had made a mistake and hit the wrong button, and meant to give her a score of 9.7. But the score could not be changed, per the FINA rules. The Canadians appealed the decision after the technical figures, but this was overturned 11-2, the two dissenting votes coming from the Canadian members of the Jury of Appeal. This let Babb-Sprague take the lead after the technical figures, and Fréchette was unable to overcome that lead, as Babb-Sprague seemingly won the gold medal.
But that would not be the end of it. Dick Pound, powerful Canadian IOC Member, led a further appeal to have the results overturned. FINA eventually caved to the pressure and elected to declare Fréchette and Babb-Sprague as co-champions in October 1993, and the IOC awarded Fréchette a gold medal in December 1993.

There were 26 starters, led by 2015 World Champion Jordan Wilimovsky of the USA, 2015 World runner-up Ferry Weertman of the Netherlands, and the defending gold medalist, Oussama Mellouli of Tunisia. The race was very tight as Weertman came to the line and won the gold medal in a photo finish over Greece’s Spyridon Gianniotis, with another photo needed to settle bronze between France’s Marc-Antoine Oliver and China’s Zu Lijun, with Oliver getting the nod. Jack Burnell (GBR) was also in that photo for bronze medal but he was disqualified for interfering with Mellouli near the line. Wilimovsky was a few seconds back in fifth place, while Mellouli finished 12th.

At the 1980 Summer Olympics, three of the nation’s crew, Jutta Lau, Roswietha Zobelt, and Liane Weigelt-Buhr, were defending medalists from the 1976 Games, and all were heavy favorites to retain the title. The Bulgarians, who had won the 1978 World Championships and medaled at every edition except for the first, boasted four World Champions in their delegation, Anka Georgieva, Rumelyana Boncheva, Dolores Nakova, and Anka Bakova, and were augmented by Mariana Serbezova, who had helped them win silver at the Worlds in 1979. Romania had earned bronze at the last Olympics, from which Maria Micşa-Macoviciuc and Elena Giurcă returned in the hopes of a better result, as well as silver and bronze at the 1977 and 1979 World Championships respectively.
The opening heats were won by Romania and Bulgaria, the former of whom faced no serious opposition while the latter defeated both the Soviet Union, World bronze medalists in 1974, 1975, and 1978, and East Germany. In the final, however, it was the Soviets who presented a serious challenge to the East Germans and nearly got the best of them, losing gold by less than half a second and settling instead for silver. The Soviets barely escaped an even lower ranking, as the Bulgarians came in only 0.37 seconds later to take bronze in one of the most exciting and closest rowing finales of the Games.

Since then, there had been two World Championships, with Switzerland winning the mixed team title in 2019 and Norway in 2021. The reigning Norwegian world champions from Cortina d’Ampezzo in 2021 were Thea Stjernesund, Kristina Riis-Johannessen, Sebastian Foss Solevåg, Fabian Wilkens Solheim, and reserve Kristin Lysdahl. In the World Cup, the team event is held just once every season, at the finals, and counts only for the Nations Cup. The last winner from Lenzerheide in March 2021 was again Norway (with Lysdahl, Riis-Johannessen, Foss Solevåg, and Nestvold-Haugen), while Switzerland won in 2019 and Sweden in 2018. The 2020 event was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
In the 2021/22 ongoing World Cup, one individual parallel event was held at an early stage of the season in November 2021. These events are contested in a format similar to the team event, and have been won by Christian Hirschbühl and Andreja Slokar. For both it was their first ever and only World Cup win going into the Beijing Olympics.
The top 15 nations in the Nations Cup standings just before the Beijing Games qualified for this event with China, who had never won a World Cup point in history, being added as host. As Croatia in 12th and Great Britain in 14th withdrew and, of the other nations, only ROC decided to start, only 15 nations took part. This led to a first-round bye for Austria, who were Nations Cup leaders at the time. The first round saw a clear win for Switzerland over China and two close matches followed when Slovenia and Norway won only by total time elapsed. After the first round it was apparent that the blue course was faster than the red one, which meant that the skier on the red course was unable to win without a serious mistake of their rival on blue.
The most exciting of the quarter-finals was seen when Norway won on accumulated time over France by only 0.02 seconds. Austria won its semi-final by total time elapsed, while Germany won 3-1 after Paula Moltzan (blue course) and Emma Aicher (red course) both did not finish their run, but Aicher stayed on course a bit longer than Moltzan to win the point. Both the final and third place match were also decided on time only as both ended 2-2 with Austria winning gold, Germany silver, and Norway bronze.
The best run times had both been set on the blue course, by Andreja Slokar (24.07) and Trevor Philp (23.53), while the best times on the red course had been 24.51 by Tessa Worley and 23.85 by Žan Kranjec. The times of Slokar, Philp, and Kranjec were all achieved in the very first match of the first round when they faced each other.
Johannes Strolz of Austria’s gold medal-winning team did not score any points for his country, as he always skied on the red course, but he did become the only Alpine skier at these Games to win two gold medals after earlier winning gold in the Alpine Combined. His teammate Katharina Liensberger, who won a slalom silver medal, became the most successful female Alpine skier at the Beijing Games. Finishing in fourth position with team USA, Mikaela Shiffrin again did not win a medal and she had to leave Beijing without a medal while Germany won its first Alpine skiing medal of the Games, in the very last event.

Both Sergey Savelyev, gold medalist in 30 km in both the 1976 Winter Olympics and the 1978 World Championships, and Nikolay Zimyatov, newly crowned Olympic gold medalist from the 30 km race nine days earlier, were among the favorites, together with another Soviet skier, Yevgeny Belyayev, silver medalist at the distance in the 1978 World Championships. Their most dangerous rival was expected to be Sven-Åke Lundbäck from Sweden, the reigning World Champion. Finland’s Juha Mieto was not considered a long distance specialist. His first place at the 1973 Holmenkollen in the 50 km was his only major victory at the distance, but he had shown great form and had to be considered. Norway’s defending Olympic Champion Ivar Formo had quit top-level sport at the age of 26 after the 1978 season to give priority to his engineering studies, leaving Norway’s hopes to Lars Erik Eriksen, fifth in the 1978 World Championships, and Oddvar Brå, a gifted skier who had a tendency to disappoint at the big events.
At the first intermediate time at 12.5 km, the fourth and least known skier on the Soviet team, the 24-year old Moscow-born Aleksandr Zavyalov, had taken a clear lead, almost half a minute ahead of Savelyev. With Zimyatov in fourth and Belyayev in fifth place, it looked very promising for the Soviet skiers. At 17 km Zavyalov was still leading, now with Zimyatov second, 33 seconds behind. Jean-Pierre Pierrat, a 27-year old Frenchman who had taken the bronze medal at the distance in the 1978 World Championships, had moved up from 13th to third. Pierrat was a respected marathon skier, winning France’s first ever Nordic skiing medal, and had also won the prestigious Vasaloppet in 1978. At the halfway point the brave Zavyalov was still in the lead, but now Zimyatov was only three seconds behind. They were already in a class of their own. The skier in third place, Finland’s Asko Autio, was 1:17 behind. Savelyev was still fourth, Pierrat now dropping down to sixth. At 42 km, Zimyatov had made his move, taking the lead from his struggling teammate Zavyalov and building up a one and a half minute lead. Skiing fastest of all behind Zimyatov, Juha Mieto had advanced from eighth to third, 40 seconds behind Zayvalov and 40 seconds ahead of Savelyev, still in fourth position. Eriksen had moved up to fifth, only 18 seconds behind. Autio had lost two minutes to his closest rival and had dropped to seventh, and Pierrat was also fading.
In the final part of the race Zimyatov extended his lead in a most impressive way, winning his third gold medal at Lake Placid by a margin of almost three minutes. Juha Mieto skied a well-judged race and took another silver medal ahead of Zavyalov, who struggled at the end but was able to edge out Eriksen by 1.5 seconds for the bronze. With Salvelyev and Belyayev in fifth and sixth place it was a triumphant day for the Soviet skiers. Brå and Lundbäck gave away too much in the first half of the race, but finished decently as seventh and eighth. With his Olympic victory over 50 km, Nikolay Zimyatov was definitively the king of cross-country skiing at the 1980 Winter Games, winning three out of a possible four gold medals.

Makarov also did not have his best day, only able to get the bronze medal.

A veteran of two Winter Olympics, he’d won a bronze medal with the Australian relay team in 1992, and had been a relay World Champion in 1991. But by 2002, Bradbury was no longer considered a factor. His participation in Salt Lake City was remarkable already, having broken two neck vertebrae in a training crash in late 2000.
Bradbury easily survived the heats, but appeared to go out in the quarter-finals, when star skater Marc Gagnon was disqualified for obstructing a Japanese rival, allowing the Australian to advance. A similar situation occurred in the semi-finals, when Bradbury was in third place when the defending champion, Kim Dong-Seong, collided with Satoru Terao, eliminating them both. Bradbury again advanced for an unexpected spot in the final. That appeared the best he could do, as the other four finalists quickly distanced themselves from Bradbury. In the very last curve, crowd favorite Apolo Anton Ohno and Li Jiajun of China collided, taking Mathieu Turcotte and An Hyeon-Su with them. With the rest of field laying scattered on the ice, Bradbury crossed the line first. As he raised his arms in disbelief, the others scrambled to get up and cross the line, Ohno throwing his skate over the line first, followed by Turcotte.
Bradbury’s surprise victory was Australia’s first ever gold medal in the Winter Olympics, and it made him a celebrity in his home country. Just days after the final, Australia Post issued a stamp with his likeness, and “doing a Bradbury” entered Australian vocabulary as a term for a miraculous victory.

Second was East Germany’s Karin Kessow, who won the all-around, followed by Soviet skater, Tatyana Averina, who had already won the 1,000 in Innsbruck. The world record had been set by Tamara Kuznetsova at Medeo in 1975, but she was also not at the 1976 Winter Olympics.
In the first pair East German Ines Bautzmann broke the Olympic record with 4:46.67. Averina was in the sixth pair and moved ahead, posting 4:45.19, narrowly above the world record of 4:44.69, and three seconds better than her PB. Three pairs later Norway’s Lisbeth Korsmo was right on Averina’s pace for most of the race only to miss out by a tantalizingly close margin, 4:45.24 – only 5/100ths of a second back. In the 10th pair, East German Andrea Mitscherlich was even closer, finishing in 4:45.23, especially fast when one considers that Mitscherlich had only recently turned 15-years-old. Kessow was up in the final pair, the 13th. She skated well, and was never much off the leading pace, finishing in 4:45.60. Remarkably the four top skaters were within 41/100ths of a second.
Averina was the top female skater at the 1976 Winter Olympics. She won two gold medals and two bronze medals in the four events. This was her first ever victory in a 3,000 at a major meet, as early in her career, she had primarily been considered a sprinter. Averina would win the 1978 World Championships.

But she upped her game and won the next two sets 21-12 and 21-15.

There were no surprises in the group stage, as all of the favorites advanced to the elimination round, with Chen and Tai qualifying directly for the quarterfinals. The quarterfinals again went mostly as expected, with the only notable elimination being Okuhara, who lost in three sets to China’s He Bingjiao. In the semis, Chen defeated her compatriot He and Tai bested Sindhu to set up the most exciting match of the tournament for the final. In a hard-fought match, Chen just barely edged out Tai in three sets, claiming gold. The bronze medal match was more one-sided, with Sindhu emerging victorious over He to capture her second Olympic medal. Tai’s medal was only the second for Taiwan in badminton; the first had come a day earlier when Lee Yang and Wang Chi-Lin had taken gold in the men’s doubles.

The best ski time was posted by Magnus Moan (NOR) but he had been only 40th in the jumping. Lamy-Chappuis started out the run 46 seconds back but moved into the lead group early. He was pushed by Americans Spillane, Lodwick, and Bill Demong, who came from far back after his =24th place in the jump. In the end the final sprint came down to Lamy-Chappuis, Spillane, and Italian Alessandro Pittin, who finished in that order. Spillane’s silver medal was the first ever medal won in Nordic combined for the United States. The Americans also placed fourth (Lodwick) and sixth (Demong). For Lamy-Chappuis it was his first Olympic medal after placing fourth in the sprint and fifth in the team event in Torino. Lamy-Chappuis had been born in Montana to an American mother and French father, but the family moved to France when he was five.

Sweden posted the fastest time in the opening round, while Cees Koch and Jan Klingers of the Netherlands and Max Raub and Herbert Wiedermann of Austria won the other two heats. The Austrian duo had taken bronze in the K-1 4 x 500 metres relay and the K-2 500 at the 1950 World Championships, while the Netherlands had been the bronze medalist in the K-2 1000, albeit with a different crew. The final came down to an exciting four-way race between Sweden, Austria, Finland’s Kurt Wires and Yrjö Hietanen, and Germany’s Gustav Schmidt and Helmut Noller, all of whom seemed to cross the finish line at the same time. A photo finish helped the judges determine that the Finns had emerged victorious, with Sweden in second, although, due to the limits on timing accuracy in that era, both recorded the same time. The Austrians had taken bronze 0.3 seconds later, while Germany was only another 0.4 seconds behind them in fourth. This was Hietanen and Wires’ second Olympic title of the Games, having taken the K-2 10000 the previous day, and was Wires’ third Olympic medal overall, as he had been the runner-up in the 1948 K-1 10000 event.

The leading qualifiers for the final were Bob McMillen (USA), Patrick El Mabrouk (FRA), Werner Lueg (GER), Audun Boysen (NOR), Josy Barthel (LUX), and Roger Bannister (GBR). The first lap was led by Germany’s Rolf Lamers in the overly fast time of 57.8. He still led after two laps but in a more reasonable 2:01.4. Lueg led thru 1,000 metres in 2:32.8 with the field still closely bunched. He continued to lead into the last curve, with McMillen, Bannister, Barthel and El Mabrouk chasing him. Lueg finally tied up on the straight and Barthel and McMillen passed him while Bannister and El Mabrouk began to slow. In one of the greatest Olympic finishes ever, Barthel barely held off McMillen, while Lueg recovered slightly to get the bronze medal. Roger Bannister finished fourth. A bit less than two years later, on 6 May 1954, at the Iffley Road track at Oxford, Bannister ran the mile in the British AAA vs. Oxford meet. His time that day was a world record of 3:59.4, making him the first runner to better the magical 4-minute mile barrier. Barthel’s gold medal was the “first” ever for tiny Luxembourg, although in the 1990s, French athletics historian Alain Bouillé discovered that the 1900 marathon gold medalist, Michel Théato, was actually a Luxembourgeois national.

If so, the maximum length of the épée blade was 34 inches (86 cm) and the maximum diameter of the guard was five inches (13 cm). Bouts were for three touches with each touch counting for one point. In cases where both fencers were touched simultaneously, one-quarter point was deducted from each contestant’s point score. The final placement of the fencers was determined not by the number of bout victories but rather by adding the total number of points earned by each fencer with the fencer having the greatest total declared the winner, the next greatest second, and so on. So, no touch counts or bout victories are shown in the results because they were not used to determine the promotion or placement.
Charles Tatham had won the US Championship in 1901-03 but the best American fencer in 1904 was likely Charles Bothner, US Champion that year with both foil and épée, but he did not compete at the 1904 Olympics. Results of the matches in this event are not known, but gold went to Cuban Ramón Fonst, who had won the title at the 1900 Olympics in Paris, and also won the individual foil in St. Louis. Tatham came in for the silver medal, followed by Albertson Van Zo Post, who had been American champion with this weapon in 1896, and would win again in 1912.

A former track and cross-country runner at Yale, he had won the Pan-American Games marathon and the Fukuoka race in 1971, establishing him as the favorite. The race was held on the last day of the München Olympics, five days after the tragedy involving the Israeli Olympic team, which made all competitions seem meaningless. It started in the Olympic Stadium at 3 PM, and was run over an out-and-back course. Shorter won the race fairly comfortably, moving into the lead by 15 km., and was never challenged. The silver medal went to Belgium’s Karel Lismont while defending champion Mamo Wolde won the bronze medal.
Unfortunately, Shorter was not the first “runner” to enter the Olympic stadium. A West Germany student, Norbert Südhaus, decided to pull a prank and ran onto the Olympic course just outside the stadium. He ran around the track and was not pulled by officials until he neared the finish line. When Shorter entered the stadium, he saw Südhaus running on the track and did not know who he was. Shorter became the third American to win the Olympic marathon, and none of them was actually the first runner in the stadium at the end of the race. In 1904, Tom Hicks won the race, but Fred Lorz, who had dropped out, hitched a car ride, and decided to run into the stadium. In 1908, Italy’s Dorando Pietri led the race in the last half and entered the stadium first.

In between Olympics Hungary had been successful in team competition at the World Championship although the Soviets had provided the individual champions in 1970 and 1971. Csaba Fenyvesi was 29-years-old in München and had been a member of the champion Hungarian teams without achieving individual medal success at major championships.
Ironically the deciding bout of the competition was one where Csaba Fenyvesi of Hungary and Jacques Ladègaillerie were tied in their bout at the end of regulation time and were accorded a double loss, with a 5-5 score.. Had Ladègaillerie won he would have matched the Hungarian’s win-loss but the tie consigned him to win silver behind Fenyvesi. Defending champion Kulcsár won bronze.
One of the favorites sadly did not fare well. West German Rudi Maier had won the 1971 Heidenheim Pokal, considered the Wimbledon of fencing, and was the first German to win it in 15 years. He had also placed seventh at the 1971 World Championships. In pool four in München, he drew Ladègaillerie in his first match and was leading, 3-1, when, as Maier walked back to the en garde line, he collapsed and lost consciousness. Maier was rushed to the hospital but was rendered quadriplegic from uncertain causes, although a blood clot on the brain was suspected. Maier never regained much function and was permanently confined to a wheelchair.

Merritt had been World Junior Champion back in 2004, but had never before made the Olympic team. Another American was also highly considered, that being Jason Richardson, the 2011 World Champion.
Liu was out of the event quickly. In his heat he slammed the first barrier, and crumpled to the track, having torn his right Achilles’ tendon, the same Achilles that had forced him from the 2008 Olympics. Robles made it to the final, and got a good start, but his hamstring was iffy, and it gave out mid-race. He walked across the line in 42.86 but was later disqualified. In his semi, Merritt showed his form in running 12.94, the fastest time ever outside of a final.
Merritt was off quickly in the final, leading from the start, and was never headed, winning in a PR 12.92, his fifth time of 2012 under 12.95 seconds. Behind him Richardson won the silver, with the bronze going to Jamaican Hansle Parchment. Thirty days after the Olympic final, Merritt shattered the world record, running 12.80 to win the Van Damme Invitational in Brussels. It was the end of one of the great seasons ever in hurdling, as it marked his eighth legal mark under 13.00 in 2012, the most in history.

Heyns led from the gun but the gap between her and Beard closed quickly in the closing stages and the South African had only a third of a second to spare at the finish.

These dimensions were later to be adopted by the FIE. The target area for sabre was reduced from the whole body to “toutes les parties du corps, situées au-dessus de la ligne horizontale passant par la fourche” (“all body parts, located above the horizontal line passing through the crotch”) which seems to mean that touches to the lower torso and hips were valid but touches to the legs were not. It was only after the First World War that the modern sabre target was adopted. Standings in the pools were based on the greater number of victories, then by the greater number of touches scored, and finally by the fewest number of touches received.
In 1908 at London, Hungary began their dominance of Olympic sabre fencing.  They won the team event, and Jenő Fuchs won the individual sabre gold medal.  Fuchs was back in Stockholm, the leader of a powerful Hungarian sabre team.  Seven of the eight finalists were Hungarian, and Fuchs defended his Olympic gold medal.
From 1908 through 1964 a Hungarian fencer always won the sabre gold medal at the Olympics, with the exception of 1920, when Hungary was not invited as they were considered an aggressor nation in World War I.  Hungarians also won all the world championships in individual sabre from 1923 through 1937 and, after World War II, 1951-55.

A year earlier, the Danes had defeated Norway for bronze at the World Championships, and again the Norwegians drew the shortest straw. Although the 23-19 scoreline suggested a fairly close match, the Norwegians underperformed and had to rely on their goalie (Heidi Tjugum) to prevent a larger defeat. The Hungarians, playing Korea in the other semi, had no such luck. Korea went all out and thrashed Hungary 39-25.
The final was an exciting spectacle, attended by vocal crowds of fans from both teams. Korea took command in the first half, leading 17-13 at half time. Denmark, with star player Anja Andersen at the helm, regrouped in the second part and slowly drew closer. With six seconds left on the clock, Andersen was fouled. A consistent penalty taker, Andersen took the shot herself. But Oh Yeong-Ran, the Korean goalkeeper, blocked the shot with her right foot, and the game went into overtime. Remarkably, Denmark was not shattered by the missed penalty shot, and they got out of the blocks with three unanswered goals. They held on to this lead in the 10 minutes of overtime, emerging victorious with 37-33.

There were only four nations competing in hockey at Antwerp.  Great Britain won the tournament, being unbeaten and unchallenged in the round robin event.  At the time, Britain was the preeminent nation in international hockey.  Despite playing but two matches, Britain outscored her opponents by 17-2.
Great Britain was led by Stanley Shoveller, the island nation’s greatest ever center-forward, who captained the English side from 1910-1921.  In the match against Belgium, Shoveller scored 6 goals.  Shoveller had also played for the English team that had won the 1908 hockey gold medal.  He was the only player who competed in hockey at both the 1908 and 1920 Olympic Games.
One of the British players, Rex Crummack, was far better known as a golfer.  He played in the British Amateur Championship in 1909 and continued through 1946, the only player to have competed before World War I and after World War II.  Another, Jack MacBryan, was a well-known cricketer, being named in 1925 as one of Wisden’s Cricketers of the Year.

The reigning World Champion was Austria’s Stefan Kraft, who had also won the event at the 2017 edition.
The winner of the qualifying round in Beijing was Marius Lindvik of Norway, the silver medalist in the normal hill at the 2016 Winter Youth Olympics, where he had also taken silver with the cross-country skiing / ski jumping / Nordic combined team. His compatriot Halvor Egner Granerud was second, while Slovenia’s Peter Prevc, the 2014 Olympic bronze medalist, was third. Kraft came in fourth, while Stoch was down in eighth.
In the first round of the final, the best jumper was Ryoyu Kobayashi of Japan, who had won the normal hill event in Beijing a few days earlier. Lindvik had the second-best jump, with Slovenia’s Timi Zajc in third and Stoch in fourth. In the second part, however, Lindvik had by far the best jump of the event and was able to surpass Kobayashi who, despite another excellent jump, had to settle for silver. No other competitor had two great jumps in the final, so bronze went to Karl Geiger of Germany, who had been only sixth after the first round. Stoch came in eight in the second round, but this was sufficient to keep him in fourth place, while Zajc, Granerud, Prevc, and Kraft placed 6th, 8th, 10th, and 13th respectively.

The Soviet Union, however, had won every edition of the European Championships since the last Olympics, while the Canadian crew included two members, Robert Wilson and Laurie West, who had helped their nation win the event at the 1954 British Empire and Commonwealth Games.
Perhaps conserving their strength, the United States was not as dominant as it had been in the past: its time in the opening round was bested by several nations and it survived to the semifinals only by winning the repêchage. They were stronger in the semi-finals, however, and captured the fastest time in that round, eliminating the Soviet Union in the process. It seemed to most that the final would result in another easy win for the Americans, but this was not to be the case. The race began with a battle for the lead between the Australians and the Canadians, the latter of whom emerged victorious shortly by the halfway point, only to be passed by the Americans. Unlike in previous editions, the United States did not pull away to win by a large margin, but held off the Canadians only long enough to win the gold by less than two seconds. Australia tired near the end, assuring Canada a silver medal, but finished far ahead of Sweden to capture bronze.

Thus the heats served the ridiculous purpose of reducing the field from five to a final field of four.  In addition, one qualifier, William Lewis, did not contest the final, probably as it was held on Sunday.
It was difficult to pick a favorite as the event was not contested by the AAU or AAA until 1914.  The French, however, were certain that they had the favorite in Henri Tauzin, who had won five French titles in the event, held the continental record of 58.8, and was supposedly unbeaten.
The hurdles for this event were actually 30 feet long telephone poles laid across the track, except for the final “hurdle,” which was actually a water jump!  In the final, Walter Tewksbury went away to an early lead, and was never headed.  He won easily, posting American records in the heats (probably the initial U.S. record) and the final.

The Ordinal Placement for each judge was based on Total Points awarded by that judge to the skaters.  The points were based on 60% for Compulsory Figures and 40% for Free Skating.  Final placement was determined by a Majority Placement rule.  Thus, if a skater was ranked first by a majority of the judges, that skater was placed first overall, and the process was repeated for each place.  If no absolute majority for a place existed, the tiebreakers were, in order: 1) Total Ordinals, 2) Total Points, 3) Compulsory Figure Points.",na,"The ladies’ competition was very difficult to handicap.  The scoring varied widely, as witnessed by Theresa Weld-Blanchard receiving two first place votes and one last place vote, and eventual fifth placer Margot Moe of Norway receiving one first place vote and three last place votes.  Julin-Mauroy and Norén won the gold and silver medals, respectively, because of the consistency of their placements.  Julin-Mauroy won the gold medal despite not being placed first by any judge, the only time this has ever happened in the Olympics.  A measure of the anti-German sentiment of the time was evidenced by the choice of music for Julin-Mauroy’s free skating program.  She had trained to “An der schönen blauen Donau,” a German song, but it was forbidden, and she had to change music at the last minute.
The 1920 Olympic Games was the only time that Magda Julin-Mauroy competed in international skating.  Norén was better known.  At the World Championships, she had been 3rd in 1913, and she would win silver in 1922 and another bronze in 1923.  Bronze medalist Theresa Weld-Blanchard had the longest career of any of the women in 1920.  She won the 1914 and 1920-1924 U.S. women’s title and, partnered with Nathanial Niles, she was U.S. pairs champion in 1918 and 1920-1927.  Weld-Blanchard was the first North American women’s champion (1923) and she and Niles won the North American pairs title in 1925.
Weld-Blanchard actually deserved the silver medal, and figure skating historian Benjamin Wright has noted, “The day after the ladies event, a re-tabulation of the marks showed that Theresa Weld had in fact earned more points than Svea Norén of Sweden, and deserved the silver medal.  The judges had approximated her points and awarded ordinals and the medals accordingly.  A protest was never made and the results stood as originally announced.  It was a commentary on the fact that the I.S.U. did not participate in conducting the events.”

But the event was dominated by Taylor, who added his second gold medal, using his great 400 flat speed – he was bronze medalist in that event at the 2007 World Championships. He had the fastest time in the first round (48.67) and the semi-finals (47.94). In the final he was in lane six with Jackson outside him in seven, and Clement in lane three. Taylor chased down Jackson and caught him on the backstretch. Clement was well back early but gathered strength on the final curve and was able to catch Jackson on the run-in to win the silver medal. Clement was closing very strongly when he had to cut his stride at the last hurdle, but by then Taylor had a comfortable lead.

The 2011 World Champion was Greek swimmer Spyros Gianniotis, with German Thomas Lurz having won the 2011 Worlds at 5 km. The early leaders in the race were Tunisian Oussama Mellouli, the 2008 1,500 metre freestyle gold medalist, and Canada’s Richard Weinberger, with Weinberger leading at the end of the first lap. On the second lap, Mellouli again took the lead, with American Alex Meyer joining him. But Weinberger sped up and led again at the second split, followed by his teammate Andreas Waschburger. Waschburger led after laps 3 and 4, followed by Mellouli and Weinberger, with Gianniotis and Lurz coming up close behind.

Mellouli won despite having to overcome a shoulder injury. He had earlier won a bronze medal in the 1,500 in attempting to defend that title. His victory in The Serpentine made him the first swimmer to win Olympic gold medals both in the pool and open-water, although David Davies had won a silver medal in the 2008 open-water event and a bronze in the 2004 1,500 metres.

Notably, Pavel Kulizhnikov and Denis Yuskov, who had finished 1-2 at the 2016 Worlds, and had both won World Cup races in the running season, were not allowed to compete. This left two main contenders for the title: Kjeld Nuis and Håvard Holmefjord Lorentzen. Both had already won gold at the Gangneung Oval, in the 1,500 m and 500 m, respectively. Nuis was the reigning World Champion in the event, while Lorentzen led the current World Cup standings ahead of Nuis.
The track record, set by Nuis at the 2017 Worlds, was bettered in the 13th pair by Kim Tae-Yun. Having placed 30th in the event at the 2014 Olympics, and having only occasionally placed into the international top 10, he was a virtual unknown, but his 1:08.22 moved him into an eventual bronze medal position. Lorentzen then managed to push below 1:08, helped by the fastest full lap of the field. In the final pair, Nuis opened up a tiny gap of 0.15 at the 200 m mark, and carried the advantage all the way to the finish line, leaving him with 1:07.95. Nuis thus became the third person to win gold in both 1,000 and 1,500 metres at the same Olympics, following Eric Heiden in 1980 and Gaétan Boucher in 1984.

The format used saw 12 teams sorted into three pools of four teams. The top two teams in each pool were joined in the quarter-finals by the two third place teams with the best records.
Group A was the most straightforward with tournament favourites Fiji joined in qualifying for the knockout stages by Argentina who held out to defeat the USA with a late score. Group B saw three teams finish level on 7 points but South Africa’s two blowout wins over France and Spain saw them qualify at the top of the pile with the French in the other automatic qualifying position. Australia went through as best third place team.
All this was overshadowed by the remarkable events that occurred in Group C and, in particular, the game between rank outsiders Japan and New Zealand, who were the reigning world champions. Japan scored early but when the New Zealanders took the lead early in the second half it seemed that normality had been restored. New Zealand, however, missed the conversion after the second try and a triple substitution reinvigorated Japan, with one of the substitutes scoring the equalizing try. The conversion from Japan was successful and they held out for an implausible victory. The New Zealanders, by now suffering from a spate of injuries, were also defeated by Great Britain and qualified for the quarter final only on the narrowest tie-breaker ahead of the USA.
The pattern of results in the group phases decreed that the pairing that seemed the most likely final, New Zealand versus Fiji, was instead to be played as the first of the quarter-finals. The depleted New Zealanders fought bravely but the Fijians ran out winners by 12 to 7.  Japan caused another upset by defeating France, South Africa revenged their group stage defeat to Australia and Great Britain also progressed after their game with Argentina remained scoreless until a British try in the fifth minute of sudden death extra time.
The two semi-finals were contrasting affairs. Fiji overcame Japan by 20 to 5 scoring 4 tries with only a solitary Japanese reply but the second semi-final was a great deal closer. South Africa scored an early unconverted try, Great Britain replied but importantly their conversion was good and they held off desperate pressure to win 7-5 and book a place in the final.
The final would then be a clash between Great Britain, the country which had pioneered the sevens version of the sport, and Fiji, who had taken this form of the game more closely to their hearts than any other. All pretence that this was to be an equal struggle disappeared in the early stages when the Fijians cut loose with series after series of powerful running and intricate passing. By halftime the Pacific islanders had 29 unanswered points on the board and were probably already ordering gold polish. The scoring slowed after the break but Fiji ran out comprehensive winners by 43-7. This was Fiji’s first ever Olympic medal after 64 years of competition and was greeted with a public holiday on their home islands.The Japanese fairy-tale, meanwhile, did not have a happy ending as they were crushed in the bronze medal game by South Africa
American Carlin Isles took advantage of weaker competition in the consolation bracket to finish as the tournament’s top try scorer whilst Terry Bouhraoua of France scored more points than any other player. While most of the players either took a well-deserved rest after the tournament or returned to fifteen a side competition America’s Nate Ebner returned to his American football career with the New England Patriots and, within a month, was playing in his team’s season opening game.

In the final, Metcalfe looked to be running a very strong curve but could not close on Tolan and actually entered the straight in third place, behind Tolan and teammate George Simpson. They finished in that order for an American sweep. Films of the race then revealed that Metcalfe had been the victim of a terrible measurement error, his lane being 1.5 metres longer than it should have been. He graciously decined a re-run of the race, because the Americans had swept the medals. Had the lane been measured correctly, he definitely would have placed higher, possibly beating Tolan. Metcalfe later served four terms as a US Congressman.

The squad featured top players like Hulk, Marcelo and Neymar along with a host of talents, several of which had played when Brazil won the 2011 U-20 World Cup. Their chief opponents were expected to be Spain. They had won the European qualifier, their senior team had just won Euro 2012, and a few of those players also competed at the Olympics: Javi Martínez, Juan Mata and Jordi Alba. Other contenders were the unknown British team – composed of English and Welsh players, featuring veteran star Ryan Giggs – and Mexico, which had placed third at the 2011 U-20 Worlds (runner-up Portugal didn’t qualify). Four teams débuted at the Olympics: Belarus, Gabon, Senegal and United Arab Emirates.
The biggest surprise of the preliminaries was the elimination of Spain, which lost twice and drew once. The other favorites did proceed to the quarter-finals, where the hosts lost to South Korea on penalties. Brazil won 3-2 over tiny Honduras after being 1-2 down, while Mexico needed extra time against Senegal. The fourth semi-finalist was Japan, which ousted Egypt.
Both Japan and Mexico had only once before reached the semi-final stage of an Olympic football tournament, both in 1968, when the Japanese beat Mexico for the bronze. This time, the Central Americans proceeded despite an early lead through Japan’s Yuki Otsu. South Korea, first-time Olympic semi-finalist, was too weak for the Brazilians, who proceeded into their third Olympic final.
Brazil was heavily favored for the gold, but the Mexicans delivered a sensitive blow only 28 seconds into the game, when Oribe Peralta struck after a defensive error. The Brazilians dominated most of the match, but were unable to seriously threaten the Mexican defense. With 15 minutes left on the clock, Peralta headed in a free kick to all but clinch the title. Hulk scored a late goal to lift the hopes of the Brazilian fans for a few minutes.
The bronze medal match saw South Korea beat Japan 2-0. Amid the celebrations, Korean player Park Jong-Wu held up a banner he received, stating “Dokdo is our territory” – referring to the Liancourt Rocks dispute between the two nations. As the IOC does not permit athletes to make political statements, Park was immediately banned from the medal ceremony. He was later fined and banned for two matches by FIFA, and initially did not receive his Olympic medal. In February 2013 the IOC Executive Board voted to censure Park with a strong warning for inappropriate behavior, but informed the Korean Olympic Committee to deliver a bronze medal to Park “as long as it done without fanfare or publicity of any kind”.
Earlier, the Korean team was also involved in another controversy. Following his team’s loss to South Korea, Swiss player Michel Morganella called the Koreans a “bunch of mentally handicapped retards” on Twitter, for which he was promptly expelled from the team by his coach.

In round five, the wind was legal, and Lewis popped 8.87 (29-1¼), the second-longest legal jump ever. Powell was mired in second place, watching Lewis produce the greatest series in long jump history. But then, Powell produced his best. The 8.95 (29-4½) mark on the stadium board meant that Beamon’s world record was finally broken, if the wind was legal, and it was - +0.3 m/s. In the last round, Lewis fought back, jumping another superb mark of 8.84 (29-0), also with a legal wind. But he had lost and he had lost in his effort to be the man to break Beamon’s record.

His progress to the gold medal was relatively uneventful - which was more than you could say for the events of the first round clash between Aleksandar Khristov of Bulgaria and Byeon Jeong-Il of South Korea.
Khristov and Byeon fought an even contest with the decisive factor in the Bulgarian’s favour being two points deductions issued for Byoen’s illegal use of the head. When the result was announced all hell broke loose. Firstly the Korean’s trainer charged into the ring and punched Keith Walker, the New Zealander who refereed the fight. More Koreans followed and Walker had to be protected by his fellow officials until security arrived to bundle him out of the arena. Unfortunately some of the Korean security guards sympathized with their countryman and also attempted to strike the referee. Walker returned home to New Zealand also immediately. Emil Yentchev, the Bulgarian who was the head of referees, was also targeted for reprisals and an attempt to hit him on the head with a plastic box was only thwarted by the hand of one of his fellow officials. After the disturbance had been quelled the only man to remain in the ring was the defeated Korean boxer.  The following bouts were abandoned as he staged a sit down protest in his corner. He abandoned his protest after 67 minutes after the lights had been turned out in the arena.
As a result of the protest the Korean government issued a public apology to the people of New Zealand, the head of the national Olympic committee resigned, and five officials received lengthy bans.
This event was due to see the first appearance of an Olympic competitor from the Pacific island of Vanuatu but Edouard Paululum was ruled out after being 0.5 kilos above the weight limit. This was blamed on a rather too large breakfast.

The Russian team included Nataliya Ishchenko and Svetlana Romashina, who had already won a gold medal in the duet in London, giving them two golds in synchro in 2012. Anastasiya Davydova was also on the team, giving her a record fifth gold medal in synchronized swimming. Davydova, Mariya Gromova, and Elvira Khasyanova won their third consecutive gold medals in the team event.

It also served to keep the pack together and contributed to the closest mass finish ever in Olympic marathon racing. At various points throughout the race, Martin Johnsrud Sundby (NOR), Daniel Richardsson (SWE) and Aleksandr Legkov (RUS) tried to make breaks, but they were short-lived. With 5 kilometres to go there were still around 18 skiers in the leading group. With a kilometre to go, at least 15 skiers were together. Coming into the stadium, Germany’s Axel Teichmann took the lead going up the final hill. He led on the final turn in the stadium, 100 metres remaining, but barely over Norway’s Petter Northug and Switzerland’s Dario Cologna. Cologna tragically fell in the sprint, and would finish 10th. Northug caught Teichmann in the sprint and pulled away to win the gold medal. The top five places were separated only by 1.6 seconds. Northug’s victory was not unexpected, as he was the 2009 World Champion, although in freestyle, and was leading the 2009-10 World Cup competition. This gave him his second gold medal and fourth medal of the 2010 Winter Olympics. The true meaning of the Olympic spirit was evident when Francesc Soulie (AND) defeated Jonas Thor Olsen (DEN) by 0.1 second – they were actually racing for 47th and 48th places, the last two skiers to complete the course!

A total of 24 teams qualified with each country allowed to enter a maximum of three teams. Nineteen quotas were assigned during the 2017 World Figure Skating Championships (Denmark returned their quota after it was discovered that one of their athletes did not have Danish citizenship, and there was no other eligible team). A further six quotas were given out at the 2017 CS Nebelhorn Trophy in Germany, which meant 48 athletes from 17 nations competed in PyeongChang.
Three-time World champions, Canada’s Tessa Virtue and Scott Moir had already won  three Olympic medals (2010 dance gold, 2014 dance silver, and 2014 team silver) by the time they arrived in PyeongChang. They had taken a break from the sport after the 2014 Sochi Olympics, and when they returned in time for the 2018 Olympic season, their Olympic free dance program “Moulin Rouge” was unveiled at the Canadian Championships, where they had received a perfect score of 124.70 points. By the time the individual ice dance competition started in PyeongChang, they had also captured a second Olympic gold medal in the team event. Not only were their main rivals their training partners, France’s Gabriella Papadakis and Guillaume Cizeron, they also shared the coaches of Marie-France Dubreuil and Patrice Lauzon, which set up for an epic battle.
After the short program, the Canadians were in the lead scoring 83.67 points, breaking their own world record of 82.68, set in October 2017. The French were in second place, just 1.74 points behind Virtue and Moir, despite suffering a wardrobe malfunction. Americans Madison Hubbell and Zach Donohue were in third place, with their teammates, siblings Maia Shibutani and Alex Shibutani, in fourth, with just 0.02 points separating the two American couples.
Entering the free skate long program in almost a dead-heat with the French team, Virtue and Moir had decided that since they were skating last, they were going to skate “blind”, and would not watch or listen to anyone else’s score from ahead of them.  This meant that when they took to the ice, they did not know that their French training partners had set a combined world record 205.28 points, and were in the lead. When the Canadians received their own marks after their skate, they had no idea if their 122.40 points was enough to capture the gold medal – they hadn’t done the math and had to wait for the announcer to declare they had set a world record with a combined score of 206.07 points and had won. Papadakis and Cizeron finished with a total of 205.28 points to capture the silver medal. With their bronze medal, the Shibutani (nicknamed Shib Sibs) became USA’s first double medal-winner of the 2018 Games (having won bronze in the team event).
Virtue and Moir became the most decorated ice dancers in Olympic history at the 2018 Games, and tied with Gillis Grafström of Sweden, Sonja Henie of Norway and Russia’s Irina Rodnina, for having the most gold medals in Olympic figure skating history.

After varied performances by the Brazilian sailing team, a dramatic last race of the Olympic regatta treated the enthusiastic home crowd to a golden finish, as Brazil won their only sailing medal of the Games. The standings prior to the medal race meant four boats were in with a chance of gold. The crews in contention were Spain with Támara Echegoyen and Berta Betanzos, Brazil with Martine Grael and Kahena Kunze, Denmark with Jena Hansen and Katja Salskov-Iversen and the New Zealand pair of Alex Maloney and Molly Meech. The four crews, were separated by just three points and after the medal race one of them would go home without a medal. The leading teams confirmed their superiority by placing 1, 2, 4 and 7 in the medal race. But it was Spain, who had the best score after the preliminaries, that placed seventh and last of the four contenders, and their 14 points dropped them from first to fourth place. With a fourth place finish and eight more points, Denmark snatched the bronze medal from Spain. But the stars of the extremely close final were Brazil and New Zealand. Separated by just one point going in to the final race, it meant that whichever team finished ahead of the other would win gold. Eventually, Grael and Kunze, the 2014 world champions and 2015 runners-up, edged out the other former world champions Meech and Maloney by just two points after beating the New Zealanders into second place. After the finish, family members and friends of the victors waded into the water and carried the boat to the shore with the sailors standing on top. Martine’s father Torben Grael was one of the most successful sailors ever, winning two gold, one silver and two Olympic bronze medals between 1984 and 2004.

In the current ongoing World Cup season, six races had been held and every race saw a different winner with Clément Noël (Val-d’Isère), Sebastian Foss Solevåg (Madonna di Campiglio), Johannes Strolz (Adelboden), Lucas Braathen (Wengen), Dave Ryding (Kitzbühel), and Linus Straßer (Schladming). These six winners were from five nations and the 18 podium places had been climbed by 14 different athletes.
The leader of the standings just before the Games was Braathen, followed by Foss Solevåg and Manuel Feller. The last two Crystal Globe winners were Marco Schwarz (2021) and Henrik Kristoffersen (2020), while the reigning 2021 world champion was Foss Solevåg. Marcel Hirscher had won the slalom World Cup in 2018 and 2019 and was also world champion in 2019, but he was retired, as was the 2018 Olympic champion André Myhrer.
After the first run Strolz, who despite having already won one race this season still had a high bib number with 19, was in the lead, but he only led by 0.02 seconds ahead of Kristoffersen. Next was Foss Solevåg another 0.04 seconds behind, which was the closest result after a first slalom run ever in Olympic history, with the top three places separated by only 0.06 seconds. The 12th fastest finisher after the first run, (Giuliano Razzoli), was only 87/100ths of a second behind the leader, and skiers from 15 different nations placed in the top 30.
On the second run Daniel Yule set the second-best run time to improve from 13th to a final sixth place, and he led up to Noël who, after placing sixth in the first run, set the best run time. None of the top five after the first run had been able to catch him. Next came Strolz to win silver and Foss Solevåg who secured bronze, with Kristoffersen finishing fourth.
Clément Noël was the first French Alpine skiing gold medallist since Antoine Dénériaz, who won downhill gold in 2006. For Strolz it was his second medal at the Beijing Games after winning gold in the Alpine Combined. Manufacturer Dynastar (gold) and Völkl (bronze) won their first Alpine skiing medals in Beijing while Head (silver) continued their run of winning a medal in every event.

She was expected to be challenged by Kenya’s Hellen Obiri who had trailed Hassan for silver in the 5K, and Ethiopia’s Letesenbet Gidey, who was the world record holder.
The 10K was a final only event, as it had been since 2004 at the Olympics. As in the 5K Japan’s Ririka Hironaka took the field through the early laps, leading for two kilometres at a dawdling pace before Gidey went to the lead at 3,000 metres, realizing she had to do something to blunt Hassan’s kick.
By five kilometres only seven runners remained in medal contention, and Gidey took the field to 6,000, as only she, Hassan, Obiri, and Bahrain’s Kalkidan Gezahegne remained together. Gidey kept the pace fast and Obiri would soon drop back. Over the final kilometre Gidey slowed slightly, unable to maintain the quick tempo that had been unable to drop Hassan. She still led over the last lap until Hassan turned on the burners off the last turn and Gidey could not answer. She would drop back to the bronze medal position, while Gazahegne challenged on the final straight, but Hassan was never in danger and won the gold medal.
For Sifan Hassan this completed a remarkable distance triple – gold in the 5,000 and 10,000 and a bronze medal in the 1,500. No woman had ever even run all three races before at a single Olympics, and it had only been done five times by men, with the best performance by Kenyan distance pioneer Kip Keino at the 1968 Mexico City Olympics, where he won 1,500 gold and 5K silver.

Nevertheless both started the competition nervously, Canada with a 7-6 win over Norway which required an extra end, and Great Britain losing 6-4 to reigning European champions, Sweden. As the round-robin phase progressed, the Canadian team, led by Kevin Martin, won all of their nine contests to finish at the top of their group. Norway and Switzerland, with seven and six wins respectively, also progressed to the semi-finals. However Great Britain were inconsistent throughout and eventually lost again to Sweden, 7-6, in a tie-break match to determine the last semi-finalist.
In the semi-finals, the contest between Canada and Sweden was close until around the halfway stage, when Canada won two points in both the fifth and sixth ends to put them in command, eventually winning the game 6-3. The other contest between Norway and Switzerland was a closer affair, although Norway were never behind. Three points behind going into the last end, Switzerland could only pull back one point to leave Norway the 7-5 winners.
The bronze medal contest, which featured a rare quadruple takeout by Sweden’s Niklas Edin, was very close, with never more than one point difference between the teams. Going into the final end, Sweden led by 4-3, but the Swiss had the advantage of the last stone. Swiss skip Ralph Stöckli scored the two points he needed to win the contest and the bronze medal by 5-4.
Despite their smooth passage to the final some doubts remained about the Canadians and in particular their skip Kevin Martin. Twice before, in the 2002 Olympics and more recently the 2009 World Championships, he had thrown disastrous final stones which robbed his team of the championship. In the event the final was controlled by Canada all the way. The Norwegians, who were now becoming well known for their harlequin design trousers they wore during their contests, found themselves 3-0 down at the half way stage. Although they scored two points on the sixth end, that was as close as they got, as the Canadians immediately replied with two points of their own in the next end, and went on to win the contest 6-3. This had been the first occasion that a team had been undefeated in an Olympic curling tournament since the sport’s re-introduction into the Olympics in 1998.

With China’s excellent record in synchronized diving, Tingmao and Wang Han were favourites to win the synchronised springboard gold medal, having occupied first and second place in the individual event at the Tokyo Olympics. Runners-up to them at the 2019 World Championships were the Canadian pair Jennifer Abel and Mélissa Citrini-Beaulieu, and they again finished second to the Chinese duo in Tokyo, despite lying sixth after two dives.

However, the nod had to go to the reigning Olympic, and three-time World champion, Lu Xiaojun of China, despite failing to register a total at the 2015 World Championships, when he won the snatch. Egypt’s Mohamed Ihab, the silver medalist at the last two World Championships, and known for big lifts near the end of a competition, was also fighting for a medal, as was the Kazakhstan’s Nidzhat Rakhimov, the former Azerbaijani, who had just returned from a two-year doping ban.
With three lifters tied in first place in the snatch at 165 kg, Andranik Karapetyan of Armenia and Lu broke that up with 170 kg + lifts. Lu then broke his own three-year-old snatch world record of 176 kg by lifting 1 kg more. That took him into the clean & jerk with a lead of 3 kg. It appeared the 77 kg gold medal was Lu’s to lose after Karapetyan suffered a ghastly arm injury on his second attempt at the clean & jerk. Rakhimov, who was 12 kg behind when Lu finished his lifts, surprisingly stole the gold medal, but it took a world record lift of 214 kg, and tied Lu on 379 kg, but the Kazakhstan lifter took the gold medal by virtue of his lighter body weight.
Upon winning bronze, Ihab, one of six weightlifting brothers, was the first Egyptian to win an Olympic medal in this middleweight class since 1936, when countryman Khadr El-Touni won gold at the Berlin Games.
Side note: Kazakhstan, who lost five Olympic titles from 2008 and 2012 through retrospective doping positives, was only allowed to compete because their outstanding doping cases were not fully processed in time for the 2016 Games. And that was how the results seem to end. However, in March 2022, after re-test if samples from Rio, it was announced that the gold medalist Nidzhat Rakhimov (of Kazakhstan) had tampered with his urine specimens and swapped his specimen for another clean one. He was disqualified and lost his gold medal. As of 22 March 2022 no medal advancements have been announced yet.

But at the Trials, only two inches separated Fuchs, O’Brien, and Hooper, so an American sweep was considered likely. O’Brien opened the final with 17.41 (57-1½) and this would be good enough for the gold medal. In the final round, Hooper put a scare into him, with 17.39 (57-0¾) but had to settle for silver.

His strongest challenger was hometown favorite Louis Smith, 2010 world runner-up and bronze medalist at the 2007 and 2011 World Championships and  the 2008 Olympics. Cyril Tommasone of France, silver medalist at the most recent World Championships, was a favored contender for the third podium spot, but would have to deal with a strong overall pool of competitors to earn a medal.
Smith dominated the qualifications by posting the highest scores for both difficulty and execution, and finishing nearly half a point ahead of Tommasone. Vid Hidvégi of Hungary was third while his compatriot Berki finished in fifth, behind Alberto Busnari of Italy who, despite having competed in every Olympic gymnastics tournament since 2000, was participating in his first final. Vitaliy Nakonechniy of Ukraine was sixth and Max Whitlock of Great Britain, the 2010 Commonwealth Games silver medalist, slipped into the finals in eighth place after tying David Belyavsky of Russia and Mykola Kuksenkov of Ukraine on points. The tie-breaker for the final two spots was the best execution score, and Belyavsky and Whitlock were 0.2 and 0.1 points ahead of Kuksenkov respectively. In the finals Berki performed an outstanding routine, moving into first place with a score of 16.066 and eclipsing the competition with 9.166 execution points. Whitlock was fairly distant behind him in second place, with 15.600 points. With only Smith left to go, Great Britain was guaranteed at least one medal, but Smith upped his difficulty and brought a second one by tying Berki’s score. Although the Hungarian was crowned Olympic champion by virtue of his higher execution score, the home nation was thrilled at their success in the event, having won their first silver medal in men’s gymnastics since 1908, after Walter Tysall’s placement in the individual all-around.

They had won every major title since 2012, including Olympic gold in 2014. On the other hand, the Dutch also had a history of “failing” at the Olympics (with bronzes in both 2006 and 2010) and they had not particularly impressed during the 2017/2018 season. In fact, they narrowly qualified for the event, having scored two 10th places in the World Cup season (and one win). Of the other contenders, the most remarkable was New Zealand. Peter Michael, Shane Dobbin and Reyon Kay had all transferred from inline skating, and in 2017, they had claimed a team pursuit silver at the World Championships. Other contenders included Norway, Canada and South Korea.
Four of the favorites indeed reached the semi-finals, with only Canada dropping out in the first round, be it by only a small margin. In the semis, the Koreans, who had clocked the fastest time, faced off with New Zealand. The Kiwis started out ahead, but the Koreans never trailed by much. The Koreans took command with just two laps to go and qualified for the final. In the other semi, the Norwegians were superior, improving the Olympic Record, while the Dutch, somewhat hampered by a material defect of Jan Blokhuijsen’s skate, were eliminated. They then easily dispatched the New Zealanders, who did not have a substitute racer, to win the bronze. The final was initially a close contest, with Korea and Norway exchanging the lead, before the Norwegians pulled away and earned their first victory in the event.

The origin of the modern marathon lies in the ancient legend of a Greek courier, normally seen as Pheidippides, but more likely actually Philippides. The primary source for the legend is the Greek historian Herodotus, who recorded the verbal history of men who had fought in the ancient battle of Marathon.
According to Herodotus, Philippides was sent to Sparta from Athens asking for help in the battle. After the battle, a runner, whose name was Pheidippides per Lucian and Eucles per Plutarch, was sent to Marathon from Athens to tell of the victory. Further details are sketchy, though modern legend has Pheidippides arriving in Athens to tell of victory in the battle with the words, “Rejoice, we conquer”, and then dying from his effort. There is little ancient documentary evidence to support that part of the tale.
The modern marathon was suggested by the Frenchman, Michael Bréal, a friend of Baron Pierre de Coubertin, who accompanied Coubertin to Athens in planning the 1896 Olympics. Bréal wrote Coubertin thusly, “If the Organizing Committee of the Athens Olympics would be willing to revive the famous run of the Marathon soldier as part of the program of the Games, I would be glad to offer a prize for this new Marathon race.”  The idea was immediately accepted.
The marathon race was held on 10 April 1896, starting in the village of Marathon, with the runners covering the dusty dirt roads to Athens, a distance of about 40 kilometres. There were 17 starters, of whom 12 were Greek and 5 foreign. The race started at 1400 hours when Colonel Papadiamantopoulos fired the starter’s pistol.
The leader for the first 20 km. was Albin Lermusiaux of France. At about this time, the heat, the uphill grade, and the dusty roads began to take their toll, and runners began to withdraw from the race. At the halfway mark, Greece’s Spyros Louis was in sixth place, trailing Lermusiaux, Teddy Flack (AUS), Arthur C. Blake (USA), Gyula Kellner (HUN), and the leading Greek, Georgios Lavrentis. Blake dropped out at 23 km. and the Greek favorite, Kharilaos Vasilakos, moved into third place.
Shortly thereafter, Lermusiaux tired and Flack took the lead. Lermusiaux would eventually retire at 32 km. At 32 km. Louis caught Flack and they ran together for about five kilometres. Louis finally dropped Flack near the village of Ambelokipi, and Flack dropped out on the outskirts of Athens.
At this time, various couriers who had negotiated the course on bicycles and horses entered the Panathenaic Stadium and informed the crowd of Louis’ approach, announcing, “Hellene, Hellene!” (A Greek, a Greek!)  Louis then entered the stadium, and Crown Prince Nicholas and Prince Georgios accompanied him on his last circuit. He finished and won in 2 hours, 58 minutes and 50 seconds. Vasilakos was 2nd in 3-06:03, trailed by Kellner in 3-09:35. Greece’s Spyridon Belokas was the original third-place finisher in 3-06:30 but, following a Hungarian protest, he was disqualified when it was found he had taken a carriage for a short part of the race. Ten runners finished, nine Greeks (including Belokas), and Kellner.

Qualifying scores did not carry over to the final round. In an unusual twist the two favorites were Americans Nastia Liukin and Shawn Johnson. Liukin had been the best American in 2005-06, placing second at the 2005 World Championships, but she struggled a bit in 2007 with injuries. Johnson came on in 2007 and won the World Championships in all-around that year. Liukin had the genes and gymnastics background, as her father Valery Lyukin, had won four medals and two golds at the 1988 Olympics, including a silver medal in all-around. He moved to the United States to coach gymnastics after the break-up of the Soviet Union, and spelled his name Liukin in the US, giving birth to Anastasia Valeryevna Liukin, known as Nastia. Valery Lyukin had also coached the 2004 individual all-around champion, Carly Patterson.
Nastia Liukin won the gold medal rather comfortably, by 0.6 points over Johnson, as the two Americans made the predictions come true. Liukin had the best final round scores on beam and floor, and was second on the uneven bars. Johnson tied Liukin on floor, won the vault, and was second on beam, but a poor performance on the uneven bars dropped her back to the silver medal. China’s Yang Yilin won the bronze medal, narrowly trailing Johnson, but well ahead of Russia’s Kseniya Semyonova. Yang was one of the Chinese gymnasts who was suspected of being underage at Beijing. She was implicated in the controversy when Chinal Central Television (CCTV) showed a profile of her that noted her age as 14 in 2008. She was allowed to compete as were all the Chinese gymnasts suspected of being underage, and an investigation by the FIG in October 2008 cleared them all.

He ran steadily from there, winning the race by 1:32 over Yugoslavia’s Franco Mihalić. Zátopek, not near his top form, finished sixth. In his wonderful book, All That Glitters is Not Gold, William Oscar Johnson relates the story as told to him by Mimoun. When he finished he waited for Zátopek to arrive. When he did, he did not at first acknowledge Mimoun, being in some distress. Mimoun then told him, “Emil, it was I who won.” Zátopek then turned around and saluted Mimoun, his close friend. Telling the story years later, Mimoun noted, “Oh, for me that was better than the medal.” Mimoun ran two more career marathons, failing to finish the 1958 European Championships, and finishing 34th at the 1960 Olympics.

The Americans took over on the second leg, as 100 metre breaststroke champion Lydia Jacoby had the fastest leg and took the lead. Emma McKeon, the 100 butterfly champion, swam the third leg for the Aussies, but American Torri Huske held her off, although the fastest butterfly leg was swum by Canada’s Maggie Mac Neil (55.27), followed by China’s Zhang Yufei (55.39).
The freestyle anchor legs were swum by Australia’s Cate Campbell, the United States’ Abbey Weitzeil, and Canada’s Penny Oleksiak. Weitzeil still led at the turn but could not hold off Campbell, who brought Australia home for the gold medal. Canada was one full second behind Australia in third while China was well-back in fourth.
For Emma McKeon this gave her seven medals at the Tokyo Olympics, matching the female Olympic best for a single Olympics set in 1952 at Helsinki by Soviet gymnast Mariya Gorokhovskaya. Kaylee McKeown also went home with four medals, three golds and a bronze in the mixed medley relay.

Two weeks before the Olympics Altwegg defended her European title in Vienna with du Bief placing second.

Altwegg took a commanding lead after the compulsory figures with US skaters Albright and Sonya Klopfer lying second and third. Du Bief was in 4th place and, and considered out of the fight for the gold medal. In the free skating, Altwegg secured the gold medal. The heroine by the crowd was Du Bief.

The third US skater, Ginny Baxter, was even better in the free skating, and could climb from 8th to 5th place in the overall standing.
One week later, at the World Championships in Paris, Jacqueline Du Bief had a sort of  revenge.

However, four days before this final, Bolt had won a dominant victory in the 100 metres in London, to defend that gold medal, and as he is considered slightly stronger in the long sprint, he was a heavy favorite for 200 gold. Blake was expected to be his biggest challenger, while the Americans, normally dominant in the sprints, had no clear top 200 sprinter and were really just looking to medal. Only one American, Wallace Spearmon, made the final.
Bolt was in lane seven in the final, with all his challengers inside, Blake in lane four, Spearmon in six, and the Netherlands’ Churandy Martina in lane five. But the race was over quickly. Bolt went through the curve in 10.0, a good two metres up on Blake. The third Jamaican runner, Warren Weir, was in third entering the straightaway. And that is how they would finish, as Bolt led a Jamaican sweep of the medals, the first ever for the island nation, and Blake repeated his silver medal from the 100 metres. Bolt actually eased up in the final 25 metres, probably costing him 1/10th second, but still ran 19.32, equalling the fourth fastest performance ever. Spearmon placed fourth as the United States missed medalling in this event for only the second time in the last 18 Olympic Games.

Jung’s cross-country round was blighted by an incident at fence 14c. Since 2020 “frangible pins”, a safety clip allowing a fence to collapse to avoid dangerous rotational falls for horse and rider, had been added to the fences. Jung’s mount Chipmunk struck the fence and the log dropped to the floor, accumulating 11 penalties for the pair. A later appeal on the basis that the pins had not been correctly attached after a previous incident was rejected.This tightened the competition to the point where a single fence knocked down meant the difference between Oliver Townend in first and Kazuma Tomoto of Japan in fifth after the end of the cross- country. Unfortunately, the day was overshadowed by death of Jet Set, the mount of Switzerland’s Robin Godel, who was euthanized after suffering an irreparable ligament rupture in his lower leg.
The first round of show jumping saw a clear round from Julia Krajewski of Germany move into gold medal position ahead of Townend, with veteran Australian Andrew Hoy edged into contention. Townend’s two British teammates also remained in the hunt for the medals. After the team medals were decided, the top 25 continued to decide the individual medals. Briefly, it looked like Kazuma Tomoto was going to win an improbable individual gold medal for the host nation, but a faultless round from 62-year-old Andrew Hoy put paid to his ambitions.
Tom McEwen briefly harboured dreams of being Olympic champion when Townend faltered, but Julia Krajewski and Amande de B’Neville were as precise and brave in their jumping and secured the title - 57 years after Lana du Pont became the first female competitor in Olympic eventing, a woman finally stood on top of the Olympic podium.

Spain had won the Qualification Tournament held in Baku in April, but two Spanish players had tested positive for doping after their final match against the host nation. However, the International Hockey Federation (FIH) had exonerated the players, who claimed the positive test was part of an Azeri plan to hinder the Spanish women. They had suffered phone bombardments, ill air in the hotel and tampered drinking water during the competition. CAS also dismissed the Azeri charges, allowing the Spanish women to compete.
Top favourites for the title were the Dutch girls. They had won the World Cup in 2006, and were seeking revenge for their upset loss in the 2004 Olympic final.

The British started well and qualified for the final round in joint second place behind surprise leaders Saudi Arabia as more fancied nations like Germany and France crashed out of the competition.
Although the Saudis performed well to eventually win the bronze medal it became clear halfway through the final that the championship would be decided between the Netherlands and Great Britain. The two teams matched each other clear round for clear round and mistake for mistake until it became apparent that the fate of the title would be decided by the final Dutch rider. The equation was simple – if Gerco Schröder had a four fault round then the competition would continue to a jump-off. Anything better and the Netherlands would take gold, worse and the honours would go to Great Britain. Schröder’s horse, aptly called London, knocked down the middle of the triple combination and the two teams moved on to a jump-off. When two of the first three Dutch riders made mistakes it meant that Peter Charles, who had been the weak link of the quartet so far, would clinch gold if he produced a flawless performance and that is exactly what he did to claim a first British gold in the discipline since 1952 in Helsinki. The outstanding performer was Britain’s Nick Skelton who did not make a single mistake in all five rounds of jumping. At 54 he was the oldest Champion of the entire Games.  A full generation earlier a 20-year-old Skelton had been robbed of an Olympic début and, with a much depleted field, probable medal by the decision of the British Equestrian Federation to boycott the Moscow Olympics.
These Olympics did much to emphasize the Dutch influence on the sport as all three medal winning teams were coached by Dutch nationals and three of the gold medal winning team’s horses were exported from the Netherlands to Britain.

Reigning Olympic champion Maialen Chourraut of Spain was making her fourth Olympic appearance (she also took bronze in 2012) and was attempting to defend her title. Reigning world champion Eva Terčelj of Slovenia was also a medal contender, but in the semi-final run she missed a gate and finished only 24th.
In both the preliminaries and semi-final, Fox dominated the field beating her rivals by a distance. The final, however, was against all expectations, with Germany’s two-time individual European champion, and the winner of the overall ICF World Cup in 2016 and 2017, Ricarda Funk capturing the gold medal with an error-free run. The 38-year-old Chourraut took the silver, making her the oldest athlete to win a women’s Olympic medal in canoe slalom. Although Fox posted the fastest time of the day, she also picked up four seconds in penalties relegating her to bronze, repeating her performance from Rio 2016. Mistakes by two other paddlers also proved costly in the hunt for medals. Italy’s Stefanie Horn deprived herself of a silver medal with a two-second penalty, while Poland’s Klaudia Zwolinska dropped from third to fifth with four seconds in penalties. Five years ago, Funk was the top athlete heading into the Rio Olympics, but failed at the final selection and missed the Games. Now she had that elusive gold medal to her credit.

Though she completed her last dive, she fell out of the medals. Back at the Olympics in 1972 King trailed Sweden’s Ulrika Knape in the qualifying. But she took the lead on her first dive of the finals and held on to win the gold medal, finishing with a final dive of a reverse 1½ layout with 1½ twists, the same dive on which she had hit her arm in 1968.
Knape would come through in a few days and win gold on the platform, and in 1976, added a platform silver to her sideboard. In between the two Olympics she won the inaugural World Championships on platform in 1973, and added a bronze in the Worlds in 1975. King retired after München, serving for many years as the diving coach at the US Air Force Academy, retiring as a colonel in 1992. America’s Cynthia Potter, later a renowned diving announcer on television in the USA, was expected to contend for a medal, but had struck her foot on the board in training the day before the event started and struggled with the pain throughout, eventually placing 7th.

The final was different as her back-lay-tuck-full earned her 92.92 points, to take an 11+ point lead over Sweden’s Marie Lindgren. Cheryazova placed only sixth in the second round, but her lead was sufficient to earn her the gold medal, the first Olympic medal ever won for Uzbekistan. Lindgren again placed second on her second jump to win silver. The bronze medal went to Norway’s Hilda Synnøve Lid, who had the best jump of the second round with her back full-full. Shortly after the gold medal ceremony, Cheryazova was told that her mother had died three weeks earlier while she was training for the Olympics. Her dying wish had been not to tell her daughter, so she could concentrate on winning the gold medal. Five months later, on 13 July 1994, Cheryazova slammed her head against a jump ramp while training in Lake Placid, New York. Sustaining a brain injury, she was in a coma for over a week, but recovered and returned to competition in 1995 and competed again at the 1998 Winter Olympics.

Her biggest threat was probably Viktoriya Komova of Russia, the reigning World and European Champion, although the hometown advantage for Beth Tweddle, 2006 and 2010 World Champion and European Champion from 2009 through 2011, could not be discounted. In fact, in the qualification rounds, Tweddle finished first with the highest execution score and the only combined total greater than 16.000.
In the final He went first and set the bar high, executing the highest difficulty routine of the competition and completing it with a final score of 15.933. Komova went next and scored 15.666, which was decent, but far from untouchable. In fact she was soon passed by Yao Jinnan of China, and then Tweddle, whose scores of 15.766 and 15.916 respectively knocked the Russian off the podium. The Russian team then got their revenge, however, when Aliya Mustafina, 2010 all-around World Champion and newly-minted Olympic all-around bronze medalist, matched Tweddle’s score from the qualification round at 16.133 with only to gymnasts left to go. When these competitors posted the lowest scores of the final, Mustafina became an Olympic champion while He took home the silver and Tweddle settled for bronze. American Gabby Douglas, who was a serious, but less-touted contender, committed an error in her routine during the final left her in last place.

His best time in 1968 was 15 seconds faster than the second best time for the year. But the 1968 Olympics were held at the altitude of Ciudad de México, and Clarke had been born and trained at sea-level. The pace was slow, because of the altitude, with 5K passed in 15:00.6, slower than the 1924 final. Mexico’s Juan Martínez took the lead on the 19th lap, delighting the home crowd. With two laps remaining the lead pack of four was Clarke, Kenya’s Naftali Temu, 1966 Commonwealth Games champion, Ethiopia’s Mamo Wolde, and Tunisia’s Mohamad Gammoudi, silver medalist from 1964. Temu and Wolde pulled ahead on the penultimate lap, dropping Gammoudi and Clarke. Wolde shot into the lead at the bell but Temu fought back and caught Wolde on the final straight to win by four metres. Clarke struggled in the last two laps, a victim of the altitude, finishing sixth. He collapsed at the finish line, and was administered to by an Australian doctor who was seen crying at the condition of this great athlete.
Ron Clarke is likely the greatest distance runner never to have won a major international championship, winning a bronze medal in the 1964 Olympic 10K, and four silver medals at the Commonwealth Games. But his world records set new standards and confirmed his greatness. In 1968, he visited Czech distance legend Emil Zátopek at his home in Praha. When Zátopek took him to the airport, he pressed a gift into Clarke’s hands, telling him “You deserve this.” On the plane, Clarke opened it and it was the gold medal Zátopek had won for the 1952 10,000 metres. Wallechinsky wrote that Clarke had commented, “I do know no one cherishes any gift more than I do, my only Olympic gold medal and not because of what it is … but because of the man whose spirit it represents.”

There was some focus on the United States’ JuVaughn Harrison, who was competing in both the high jump and long jump, the first American to do that at the Olympics since Jim Thorpe in 1912.
The level of jumping was high as seven cleared 2.33, the most ever at a competition, and four jumpers cleared 2.35 metres, with two passing to the next height of 2.37. At 2.37 three jumpers cleared on their first attempt – Barshim, Italian Gianmarco Tamberi, and Belarussian Maksim Nedasekau. With passes, however, there were still six jumpers in the competition at 2.39, but Harrison, Korea’s Wu Sang-Hyeok, and Australian Brandon Starc would not clear and the medals were decided.
When Barshim, Tamberi, and Nedasekau missed all three attempts at 2.39, the bronze medal went to the Belarussian as he had one miss at his opening height of 2.19 and Barshim and Tamberi had been clear. A jump-off for gold seemed in the offing.
Or did it? An official met with the two jumpers and they asked if they had to jump-off, or if they could share the gold medal. The official informed them they could do that, and both Barshim and Tamberi would take gold. Tamberi, a decided underdog, was exultant and his victory celebration was one of the highlights of the athletics competition at Tokyo. Two gold medals in an Olympic athletics event had not happened since the 1908 pole vault, when A. C. Gilbert and Ed Cook had shared gold.

Australia also had an easy time in the semis with China, winning 90-56, but the Americans were pushed by the Russian team, eventually winning 67-52. Thus the two favorites advanced to the final, and it was not close. The US reeked havoc, possibly in revenge for the loss at the 2006 Worlds, defeating the Australians 92-65, to win their fourth consecutive gold medal, and six of the last seven. The US was led by Lisa Leslie, who had played for all four US teams since 1996. Katie Smith also won her third consecutive gold medal.

Haspinger had almost half a second on Glass – a large margin in luge terms – and seemed headed for the gold until 150 metres before the finish. Once more, turn 12 took a victim, and Haspinger finished last in the run and fell off the podium. Glass thus became the surprising winner, ahead of Hildgartner and Anton Winkler (FRG).

Its competitors typically use only a single ski, and are supported by two “outriggers”, a ski pole with a small ski on the end.
The giant slalom event was clearly won by Alexander Spitz. The West German was diagnosed with bone cancer at age 10, and had his right leg amputated above the knee. This did not stop him from continuing with his favorite sport, skiing. He competed in Sarajevo at age 16, and would go on to compete in five Paralympic Winter Games, winning a total of four golds, four silvers and three bronze. In the 1984 Paralympic Giant Slalom, he placed second behind Rainer Bergmann, whom he’d beaten in the Sarajevo Exhibition.

This was expected to be a two-woman race as Australia’s Ariarne Titmus had been coming closer to Ledecky’s times, had won that match-up at the 2019 Worlds, and recorded the second fastest time ever at the Australian Olympic Trials with 3:56.90.
Both qualified for the final easily, with Ledecky first, Titmus third, and China’s Li Bingjie in the middle. The final was on Monday morning, and was much anticipated. Ledecky took the lead early, splitting 57.67 at 100 metres and holding the lead through almost 350 metres. Titmus, as is her style, held back slightly but was expected to finish faster, and it was notable that although Ledecky led, she never opened much of a gap over Titmus.
And just past 300 metres Titmus pulled ahead slightly, reaching the final turn with a 0.22 margin. Ledecky could not respond as Titmus increased her lead to win gold in 3:56.69, as Ledecky finished in 3:57.36. Titmus’s time was the second fastest ever, and Ledecky swam her second fastest 400 in finishing second.
Immediately the discussion began of the legendary status of the race, many swim experts calling it the greatest ever women’s Olympic race. Few argued with that. Almost as notable as Titmus was her coach, Dean Boxall, who went into a wild celebration of fist-pumping, arm waving, and screaming up in the stands.
Titmus and Ledecky were more restrained and spoke admirably of each other, Titmus noting, “I wouldn’t be here without her. She’s set this standard for middle-distance freestyle. If I didn’t have someone like her to chase, I definitely wouldn’t be swimming the way I am.”
Ledecky handled the defeat with class, “It can’t get much better than that. It was tremendous racing, a lot of fun and I can’t be too disappointed with that. That was my second-best swim ever and I feel like I fought tooth and nail and that’s all you can ask for.”

A surprising absentee was Denmark, winner of the past three Olympic gold medals. They had failed to qualify after finishing only 11th at the 2006 Europeans.
The absence of Denmark made the two favorites Russia (the reigning World Champion) and Norway (runner-up). Both nations placed top of their pool in Beijing, Norway winning each of its five pool matches, while Russia drew South Korea, the 2004 silver medallists. Norway also had little trouble making the semi-finals, beating Sweden easily 31-24. The Russians faced a tougher opponent in France, which they only overcame in extra time after tying 24-24. The other two semi-finalists were South Korea and Hungary, both traditionally strong handball nations.
Russia faced Hungary in the semi-finals, taking a strong lead in the first half (14-9). Hungary then managed a slight comeback, but nothing that worried the Russians, who made their first Olympic final –  although the Soviet Union had won two golds in 1976 and 1980. The other semi-final was between Norway and South Korea, the 1988 and 1992 Olympic finalists. Korea took a four-point lead halfway through the first half, but by the whistle, the Norwegians had closed it to 15-14. They opened strongly in the second half, pulling away to 20-17. In the last minute, with Norway short-handed, the Koreans scored three times to tie the match at 28-28. The last goal by Mun Pil-Hui came with 7 seconds left on the clock. With some of the Koreans still cheering, the Norwegians quickly restarted play, passed twice, and Gro Hammerseng put the ball in the lower left corner – right at the horn for full time. The Koreans immediately protested the goal was made after full time, but the goal was allowed. Korea did not give up, and their coach continued arguing with the match officials for close to an hour, and Korea lodged various official protests, all of which were denied.
Norway and Russia met in the final of a major tournament for the fourth time since 2001, with the Russians having won two of these encounters. But compared to the semi-finals, the final was hardly a contest. Within 10 minutes, the Norwegians had pulled away to 9-2 lead, after which they controlled the match. Russia managed to end the first half at 18-13, but never had a chance in the second half. Norway managed to make the gap as wide as 34-23 with slightly over a minute to play. Four late goals by the Russians couldn’t prevent a clear Norwegian victory – the first ever at the Olympics. Korea had bounced back after the deception in the semi-finals, and defeated Hungary for the bronze, the country’s sixth Olympic medal in women’s handball.

By that metric, East Germany’s Christine Scheiblich was the strong favorite in Montreal: in 1976 she had the first two World Championship titles under her belt, and would have the next two by the end of her career. In the opening round she outperformed her nearest competitor, Joan Lind of the United States, by nearly five seconds, but the final was much more exciting. Scheiblich led for most of the way, but was seriously challenged by Lind who, after having been in fourth, made a drive to catch the East German and missed gold by only 0.65 seconds, being forced instead to accept silver.

After a slow start and coming desperately close to being eliminated, Tao recovered on his third snatch, after two fails. Then he missed his first two clean & jerks too, bringing back memories of the 2015 World Championships when he missed all three attempts, having led after the snatch. Thankfully, Tao rallied and made things tough on Rostami (who had set two world records earlier in the year), setting an Olympic record for the clean & jerk (217 kg) and total (395 kg), before Rostami took it from him with a 217 kg clean & jerk, and breaking his own total world record of 395 kg with a 396 kg, to capture the gold medal.

The 2019 World Champion was Aaron Blunck, also of the United States.
After a disastrous first run, Blunck managed to climb to the top of the qualifying round with an impressive performance in the second run that netted him 92.00 points. Porteous was the only other skier to reach 90 points in qualifying, with 90.50, although American Birk Irving, the 2016 Winter Youth Olympic champion, was close with 89.75. Wise came in fourth, with Ferreira further down in seventh.
The winners were determined in the first run of the final, with Porteous (gold), Wise (silver), and Ferreira (bronze) setting the three highest scores of the round. This meant that the 2022 Olympic podium held the same three individuals as in 2018, albeit in different positions. This was only the second winter Olympic gold medal for New Zealand, after Zoi Sadowski-Synnott won snowboarding’s slopestyle event earlier in the Beijing Games. Wise and Blunck ended up fifth and seventh respectively.

In the early rounds, he was the most impressive fighter, winning four straight matches by ippon. Koga struggled to make the final after injuring his knee in a sparring session before the Olympics. The final came down to hantei, with Koga winning by yusei-gachi, which surprised many in the crowd who thought Hajtós had won. Koga would retire after Barcelona, but returned in 1995 to win the Worlds in half-middleweight and also won a silver at the 1996 Olympics in half-middleweight.
The day before this event, Israel’s Yael Arad became the first Israeli athlete to win an Olympic medal, when she placed second in the women’s half-middleweight division. Arad dedicated her medal to “the eleven” – the 11 Israelis who had been cowardly murdered by Black September terrorists at the 1972 Olympics. In this class, Israel’s Shay-Oren Smadga won a bronze medal, the first Olympic medal won by an Israeli man.

It became clear at the semi-final stage, where Peirsol was two seconds faster than any of his rivals, that the rest of the field would merely be fighting for the silver and bronze medal. As expected the American proceeded to blitz the field and won by the almost unbelievable margin of nearly two and a half seconds. Peirsol was celebrating his victory when suddenly the scoreboard flickered and the letters DQ appeared next to his name to indicate he was disqualified from the final. His offence was to kick into the final turn after he’d turned onto his stomach to make the turn, which is illegal under the rules. For half an hour it appeared that Markus Rogan had become the first Austrian Olympic swimming champion since the inaugural Summer Olympics in 1896 but his joy was short-lived. FINA announced that the disqualification could not stand because the official judging the turns had made an error in the paperwork and had failed to describe the nature of the infringement in either French or English on the relevant document. This was a serious breach of the regulations. Appeals from both Austria and Great Britain were rejected.
Piersol returned for a third Olympic Games in 2008 but was narrowly beaten by his fellow American Ryan Lochte. His 2008 silver added to that won in 2000 meant that he became one of the rare few swimmers to have medalled in the same event at three successive Games.

The NHL’s absence in 2018 was felt as a major loss, especially due to the fact that a best-on-best competition for men’s ice hockey had not been held for many years. All indications were pointing towards the NHL players returning to the Olympics when an agreement was reached with the renewal of players’ the collective bargaining agreement with the league in 2020; however, by late 2021, a sense of uncertainty began to grow amidst another wave of COVID-19 cases, which prompted many effects on the league, including game cancellations, postponements and travel restrictions. On 21 December 2021, the league made it official, announcing that its players would not participate in the men’s tournament at the upcoming Beijing 2022 Winter Olympic Games; thus each respective country was left to determine a roster in just over a month’s time.
Like PyeongChang 2018, most players in the men’s tournament were selected from European professional leagues, although a few players playing at the collegiate, minor league, and major junior level in North America also were selected. Without NHL players, the podium was seen to be a bit more uncertain, although the usual favorites, Canada, United States, Finland, Sweden, Russian Olympic Committee, Slovakia and the Czech Republic, were all seen to have a chance to medal. Denmark, and the host country, China, were participating in the men’s tournament for the first time ever.
Following the round-robin, Latvia and China ended up being the odd ones out of the quarterfinals, both having lost all four of their games. Canada and the United States both suffered disappointing defeats in the quarterfinals at the hands of Sweden and Slovakia respectively, and thus both did not advance to the semifinals for the first time since Torino 2006. The other two teams to advance would be ROC and Finland, who defeated Denmark and Switzerland. Slovakia would eventually win bronze over Sweden, achieving their first ever Olympic ice hockey medal since first participating in 1994.

In the World Cup, the last event was held on 1 March 2020 and was won by 2019 world champion Alexis Pinturault. The reigning world champion from 2021 was Marco Schwarz. Another curiosity was that, to meet the necessary requirements to be eligible to enter this competition, Schwarz and Strolz had to participate in a European Cup downhill at Tarvisio, Italy, in January 2022, in which Schwarz finished 31st and Strolz 39th respectively. On the day before the Beijing race, another downhill training run was held that saw Vincent Kriechmayr in the lead, but he did not compete in the Combined. Asked for the reason, he said that he was testing skiers, probably for his compatriots.
The downhill element took place first, and the start list produced the next interesting fact, as Barnabás Szőllős became the first Israeli to open an Alpine skiing event at the Olympics. There were not a lot of downhill specialists entered but, of them, Aleksander Aamodt Kilde set the pace and finished first ahead of Jack Crawford and Brodie Seger. Following in fourth was Johannes Strolz, the first slalom skier, and he was followed by Marco Schwarz. Down in 11th place was Pinturault, equal with Szőllős, already almost two seconds behind Kilde but even more importantly, 1.17 behind Strolz, and 0.97 behind Schwarz.
A change in the rules from 2018 was that after the downhill, the fastest had to start first in the slalom, so the slalom element was opened by Kilde. He put in a good performance and held off Crawford by 0.09 seconds only to be overtaken by the fourth starter Strolz. As none of the others were able to reach the times of the leaders, the podium was already decided. Neither Schwarz nor Murisier caught them and Pinturault did not finish his slalom run. Surprisingly Szőllős, who had only participated in four World Cup races before, and only one of them was a slalom, set the second-best slalom time to finish sixth overall.
Strolz won gold in this event just as his father Hubert Strolz did in 1988. They became the first father and son to do so in Alpine skiing. This triumph was even more remarkable because Johannes Strolz was kicked out of all Austrian national teams before the start of the season as his results were not good enough. He kept fighting, had to pay all his own expenses, including training, and he prepared his skis by himself for every race.
The win also brought manufacturer Head its third gold medal in the third men’s Alpine skiing event, as well as another bronze, while Atomic took silver. The bronze medal of Crawford was the first ever medal for Canada in this event. With only 17 finishers, the Combined saw the best Alpine skiing results ever for Israel (6th), Ireland (12th), Monaco (13th), and Kosovo (15th), and the best Alpine skiing result ever for a Chinese man (16th). The sixth place also equalled the best ever result for Israel at the Winter Olympics, achieved by the ice dance pair Galit Chait/Sergey Sakhnovsky in 2002.

But Russi bettered Sprecher’s time by over 1½ seconds and the time held up for the gold medal. Sprecher would eventually drop to fourth behind Roland Collombin (SUI-silver) and Heini Messner (AUT-bronze). David Wallechinsky has noted in The Complete Book of the Winter Olympics, )The hypocrisy of the IOC’s decision against Schranz was shown by the fact that … Russi had allowed his photo and name to be used on matchboxes, car stickers, and newspaper advertisements as part of a large-scale pre-Olympic publicity campaign for a Swiss insurance company.)

Switzerland, with gold in 1897 and 1899 and bronze in 1898, and France, with gold in 1898, silver in 1899 and bronze in 1897 had won a medal in each of the three Championships. The only other nations to win medals were Norway (silver 1897), Italy (silver 1898), and Denmark (bronze 1899). Of these five medal-winning teams, only Italy did not send a team to Paris. The reigning World Champions Switzerland retained their title and also collected the Olympic gold thanks to Franz Böckli, Alfred Grütter, Emil Kellenberger, Konrad Stäheli, and Louis Richardet, who was a replacement for Caspar Widmer in Paris. Richardet was a member of the Swiss gold medal-winning team at the inaugural Worlds in 1897.
Three members of the French World Championship-winning team of 1898 took part in Paris; Achille Paroche, Léon Moreaux, and Auguste Cavadini, of whom two, Paroche and Moreaux, were also on the silver medal winning team in 1899. The Denmark bronze medal-winning team from the 1899 Worlds was nearly the same in Paris, with Axel Kristensen replacing J. Johansen.
Switzerland, led by the individual champion Emil Kellenberger, won the gold medal by over 100 points but it was close from second through fourth place with Norway just ahead of France by 12 points, and Denmark a further 13 points behind in fourth. The winning score of 4399 points was worse than the scores of 1898 World Champions France (4447 points) and Switzerland’s winning total in 1899 (4528 points).

With hands as quick as a snake’s bite, Leonard advanced to the final to face Cuba’s Andrés Aldama, who was also relatively inexperienced. The final was not close as Leonard won by unanimous decision. Aldama would return to the Olympics in 1980, after winning Pan American gold in 1979, and win a gold medal, defeating John Mugabi in the welterweight final, a future professional champion.
Sugar Ray Leonard moved on to the professional ranks, although he had stated all during the Olympics that he would not do so until he had gone to college. He would have one of the great, and longest, professional careers of any Olympic boxer. He fought through 1991, although he returned for one bout in 1997. He won his first world title in 1979, the NABF welterweight crown, and he would eventually win world titles in five different weight classes. One of those came in 1981 when he defeated Ayub Kalule, the man who was not there at Montréal, for the WBA and The Ring light-middleweight crowns. Leonard became wealthy, winning over $100 million in purses, and was named the Boxer of the Decade for the 1980s. His career professional record was 36 wins, 3 losses and 1 draw.

For the Olympics, 23 boarders started, with 16 advancing to the match racing and the quarter-finals. In the match racing, the top two racers in each heat moved on to the next round. The qualifying round consisted of two runs, with the best run of the two used to determine placements. Losing semi-finalists raced off for 5th-8th places, while classification races were also held to determine the 9th-12th places and the 13th-16th places. The heavy favorite in women’s boardercross was American Lindsey Jacobellis, who had won the gold medal in the event at the last three X-Games. She qualified only third, as Canada’s Maëlle Ricker dominated with her second run, leading the qualifying by almost 1½ seconds over her teammate, Dominique Maltais. All three would comfortably advance to the final where they were joined by Swiss boarder Tanja Frieden. In the final, Jacobellis was leading for most of the race, coming to the last jump with a three-second lead over Frieden. But Jacobellis then hot dogged it, going for a twisting grab, and fell. Frieden passed her for the gold medal, but Jacobellis was able to recover for the silver. Jacobellis noted, “Snowboarding is fun. I was having fun.”

The 2011 World Champion was American Jesse Williams but he had barely made the US team. The 2008 gold medalist was Andrey Silnov of Russia, but he had struggled a bit since 2008, and was recently second to his teammate, Ivan Ukhov, at the Russian Nationals. Ukhov had the year’s best jump with 2.39, but had never won a medal at a major international. He would fix that.
Eight jumpers succeeded at 2.29, with three tied for the lead with no misses through that height: Qatar’s Mutaz Essa Barshim, Canada’s Derek Drouin, and Britain’s Robbie Grabarz. But at the next height, 2.33, only Ukhov and American Erik Kynard went clear, both on their first attempts. Ukhov then cleared 2.36 on his first try which would bring him the gold medal. Kynard missed his first attempt and passed to 2.38 where he also missed one try. When Ukhov also cleared that height, Kynard moved up to 2.40, trying to win gold, but missed again and settled for silver. The bronze was a three-way tie among Barshim, Drouin, and Grabarz. Silnov made the final but placed only 12th, and Williams would tie for ninth.
In February 2018 it was announced the Court of Arbitration for Sport that the original gold medalist, Ivan Ukhov, had an anti-doping rule violation (ADRV) and all of his results were voided from 16 July 2012 to 31 December 2015, which disqualified him from the London Olympic Games. In November 2021 the IOC announced upgrades for Kynard to gold and the three original bronze medalists to silver medals..

The event was contested as a parallel slalom with one jump at halfway. Although named parallel slalom, giant slalom gates were used for this event and skiiers created a specific kind of cross-blocking technique, using both arms to knock down the gates.
Every round saw four duels with two women and two men racing each other head-to-head, with each winner scoring a point for the team. For a tied race both nations were awarded a point and, if both racers did not finish, the skier who progressed further was awarded a point. The most number of wins decided the team winner in a single-elimination tournament. If the score was 2-2 the better race times of one female and one male time would break the draw. If still equal the fastest run time of any skier was used as a tiebreaker, and the final tiebreaker was the current World Nations Cup standings. The lower-placed team in the Nations Cup had to announce their four racers first, so the higher-placed team had the advantage of deciding who would race against whom. Every team match started with a women’s race followed by the men, and every nation had to compete with a woman and a man on the red and the blue course, respectively.
The first team event, at that time known as a combined team event, was held at the 2005 World championships in Bormio and was won by Germany. The first team event as part of the Alpine skiing World Cup was held in March 2006 in Åre with Austria as the winner and, since then, a team event was regularly contested at the World Cup final. All these events did not use the parallel format as they were held as a kind of a combined event by just adding the times of Super G and slalom runs. The parallel format started in 2010 at the World Cup final and was won by the Czech Republic and in 2011 at the World Championships (winner France) with both competitions held in Garmisch-Partenkirchen. The last five Team Events contested as part of the World Cup were all won by Switzerland (Lenzerheide 2013/14, Méribel 2014/15 and St. Moritz 2015/16) and Sweden (Innsbruck 2013/14 and Aspen 2016/17), Austria became World Champion in 2015 and France won this event at the 2017 World Championship with Adeline Baud Mugnier, Nastasia Noens, Tessa Worley, Mathieu Faivre, Julien Lizeroux and Alexis Pinturault.
The qualification system for this event allowed the best 15 nations from the current overall World Nations Cup standings to compete with South Korea automatically qualified as the host nation. When Lichtenstein (11th), Croatia (15th), Serbia (17th), and Japan (18th) did not enter a team, the Czech Republic (16th) and Hungary (19th) were invited. There was no draw as the teams were seeded according to their Nations Cup position. Every team could enter three skiers of each gender and substitutions were allowed after every round. The event was not yet a priority for the skiers as Marcel Hirscher, Henrik Kristoffersen and Mikaela Shiffrin did not participate for their nations and Switzerland did not even enter six skiers.
The first round saw the elimination of the United States, seeded in fifth, when they lost to Great Britain by cumulated time after a 2-2 draw. France also had difficulty in advancing when they won by only 0.03 seconds against Canada. In the quarter-finals Austria eliminated Sweden with a 4-0 shutout, while Norway and Switzerland only won by aggregate time. After two clear wins by Austria and Switzerland in the semi-finals, the two arch-rivals met in the final.
Austria, who lost only one duel up to the final, was not able to challenge Switzerland in the final as both men did not finish their race. Switzerland won 3-1 to become the first ever Olympic mixed team event champion. Matt set the fastest overall time with 19.23 on the blue course in the quarter-finals against Sweden, while the second best time was raced on the red course by Zenhäusern with 19.33 against Germany in the same round. The best time for women was set by Holdener with 20.97 on the red course in the semi-finals against France, and Gallhuber raced the second fastest time with 21.04 on the blue course in the same duel as her compatriot Matt. The only substitution was made by Austria, when they replaced Marco Schwarz with Manuel Feller for the quarter-finals only, but all skiers entered by the teams received medals, including the non-starters.

Bozhinov already had an Olympic medal, a silver, from the 1992 Olympics but the 1996 version was a far superior fighter than the one seen in Barcelona and was considered one of the finest amateur boxers in the world.  In Atlanta he proved his supremacy beyond doubt and was never really troubled in any of his 4 fights. The tall Bulgarian had a distinctive style, similar to that employed by Muhammad Ali AKA Cassius Clay, which involved keeping his hands down by his waist and using his reflexes to sucker his opponents into leaving themselves open to his trademark  left jabs and right hooks. 
His final opponent was Mansueto Velasco, brother  of [Roel] (/athletes/7676) who was a bronze medallist in the same division 4 years earlier. Velasco’s attempt to be the Philippines’ first Olympic champion faltered from the beginning and Bozhinov was a clear winner by 19 points to 6.

Seven days later he toed the line for the 5K final, an event he had won at the 2011 World Championships, with all Britain looking for a distance double gold. His biggest challengers were actually expected to be two Americans – Bernard Lagat, World Champion in the 1,500 and 5,000 at the 2007 World Championships; and Galen Rupp, Farah’s training partner, who had trailed behind him while winning silver in the 10K.
The final turned into a slow, tactical race, setting it up for the kickers, especially Lagat. Fully 10 of the 15 finalists came to the bell lap together, as Farah had taken the lead with 700 to go, with Rupp joining in with 600 left. But the pack passed Rupp and came after Farah, as several runners made attempts to go by him. But no one succeeded, Farah coming home in a final lap 52.9, and final straight of 13.1 to win his second gold medal. The silver went to Ethiopian Dejen Gebremeskel, who also ran 52.9 on the final lap, but could never get past Farah’s shoulder. Kenyan Thomas Longosiwa was next to them at the head of the straight but could not match their finish, taking bronze, just ahead of Lagat in fourth. Rupp did not have the kick he needed and placed seventh.
The British-mad Olympic Stadium exploded on the final lap, with Track & Field News noting that the sound reached 140 decibels, jet takeoff levels, and it rocked the stadium enough to shake the finish camera and make the final pictures too blurry, requiring use of the back-up infield camera. Farah’s 5/10K distance double marked the eighth time this had been achieved at the Olympics, the first by Finland’s Hannes Kolehmainen in 1912 and the last at Beijing by Kenenisa Bekele.

Hackett re-established himself as favourite with his performance in the heats and qualified fastest with the second fastest time in history. The final soon developed into a duel between Hackett and Canada’s Ryan Cochrane as the two traded the lead throughout the first two thirds of the race. In the final third of the race Oussama Mellouli of Tunisia, swimming in an outside lane, caught up with the leading pair and forged ahead to win an upset victory over the Australian with Cochrane holding on to claim the bronze.
Mellouli’s path to the 2008 Games was not a smooth one. The Tunisian had won the 800 metre title at the 2007 World Championships only to lose it when it was revealed that he failed a doping test at the previous year’s US Open meeting. The substance involved was revealed to be Adderall, an amphetamine used to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and narcolepsy. He claimed that he been given a pill by a fellow student at the University of Southern California in order to aid him in writing a term paper. The Tunisian authorities originally gave him merely a warning but FINA appealed to the Court of Arbitration for Sport and the punishment was upgraded to an 18-month ban. Luckily for Mellouli this gave him a small window of time to post a time good enough to qualify him for Olympic selection.

On 29 February, in the Gulf of Naples, host to the 1960 Olympic sailing races, the medal race of the 2020 RS:X World Championships was held. Apart from the world title, two friends and rivals also battled for an Olympic qualification: Dorian van Rijsselberghe and Kiran Badloe. Since Olympic sailing classes only allow a single entry per country, these two Dutch surfers had to beat the other in a combined ranking of the 2018, 2019 and 2020 World Championships in order to qualify for Tokyo. The two-time defending Olympic champion, Van Rijsselberghe, had won the 2018 title (with Badloe second). A year later, Badloe edged out his training companion, the two again finishing 1-2. The 2020 edition proved equally close. Going into the medal race, Badloe held a 10 points lead. Van Rijsselberghe gave it his all, and won the medal race. He needed to place five spots ahead of his compatriot to win the title, but Badloe came in fifth, thus narrowly retaining his title, and earning Olympic qualification. Disappointed, but happy for his friend, Van Rijsselberge then decided to retire from the sport.
Of course, Badloe still needed to actually win at Enoshima. But having also added the 2021 World and European titles to his prize cabinet, he was the obvious favorite. Naturally, there were plenty of contenders, including from traditionally strong surfing nations like France (Thomas Goyard), Italy (Mattia Gamboni), Poland (Piotr Myszka) or Great Britain (Tom Squires).
Light winds at the first competition day gave the early advantage to lightweight sailors like Mateo Sanz Lanz, who won the first two races. Badloe seemed to overtake the lead with three straight victories then, but his win in the fifth race was annulled after an Italian protest led to his disqualification for that race. This put Goyard in first, but Badloe continued strongly, taking wins in race 9, 11, and 12. With only the medal race to go, this made him all but Olympic champion; only a disqualification in the final race would cost him the gold.
Badloe sailed his medal race carefully to avoid this fate, but other medal contenders were not so cautious. The start saw three boats on course side of the starting line (a false start), and Goyard (second after 12 races), Camboni (third) and Myszka (fourth) were all forced to view the race from the sideline. Goyard was lucky to hold on to the silver medal despite his mishap, but both the Italian and the Pole dropped out of medal contention. China’s Bi Kun was happy to pick up the final open medal position.
Kiran Badloe, who had sailed with a blue arrow painted into his hair in reference of cartoon character Aang (from Avatar: The Last Airbender), went into the record books as the last Olympic champion in the RS:X class. On 1 November 2019, World Sailing had elected to replace the class - in Olympic use since 2008 - when it replaced the Mistral with the iQFoil. Badloe needn’t worry, though, as in 2020, he also won the inaugural European Championships in that class.

Carol Huynh of Canada, the defending Olympic Champion, had been Commonwealth Games Champion (2010) and twice Pan-American Games Champion (2007 and 2011) but never World Champion. The true favorite was Hitomi Obara of Japan, a six-time World Champion in the non-Olympic 51 kg class (2000, 2001, 2005-2008) who had switched to the flyweight in 2010 and captured the last two World Championships in the division. The field was rounded out with two other former World Champions, Clarissa Chun of the United States (2008) and Mariya Stadnik of Azerbaijan (2009), ensuring that no medal in the event would go unchallenged.
Huynh was drawn in the same half as Obara, to whom she lost in the semi-finals as the Japanese competitor charged for gold. The rest duked it out in the bottom half, where Stadnik defeated Chun in the 1/8 finals and Merlini in the semi-finals, earning the right to challenge Obara’s supremacy. In an aggressive first period of the final match, Stadnik became the first competitor in the event to get the best of Obara, winning the round 4-0. Obara, however, was unflappable and converted her loss into a passion for victory, which brought 1-0 and 2-0 wins over the next two periods and an Olympic crown to add her laurels.
In the first bronze medal match, Huynh met Isabelle Sambou of Senegal, vying to capture her country’s second Olympic medal ever. Sambou put up a valiant effort against the far more experienced Huynh, forcing the Olympic Champion to par terre in both periods, but she had the misfortune of drawing the disadvantaged position in both rounds and was defeated by the Canadian, who won her second Olympic medal. Chun and Merleni, meanwhile, battled for the final podium spot in a relatively more interesting match. In the first period, Chun took down her opponent at the buzzer, scoring the round-winning point, before throwing the Ukrainian to the mat for a decisive, three-point victory in the second that earned her the second bronze medal.

They won their first five Olympic games handily, but then lost to Czechoslovakia, 5-4.  Going into the final series of games, they had identical 5-1 records, and if they both won their final game, Czechoslovakia would win the gold medal, based on the head-to-head victory.   But Sweden pulled out a tie against the Czechs.  This left the gold medal in the Soviet’s hands and they easily defeated Canada, 5-0, in the final game, to defend their Olympic title.  The USSR was led by Anatoly Firsov, considered by many the greatest Russian ice hockey player ever.  A winger with great speed, he was an outstanding athlete who once scored 6 goals in a game against the Canadian national team.  He led the 1968 Olympic scorers with 12 goals.

The field included all three medallists from the 2018 World Shooting Championships with Olena Kostevych (gold), Vitalina Batsarashkina (silver), and Doreen Vennekamp (bronze). Also present in Tokyo were the three Rio medallists – Anna Korakaki, Monika Karsch and Heidi Diethelm Gerber. Batsarashkina (gold) and Antoaneta Kostadinova (silver) won medals in the air pistol event a few days earlier. For the first time in Olympic history this event was held over two days, with the first part of the qualification round, the precision, held in the morning of the first day and the second part, the rapid, held 24 hours later, followed by the final in the afternoon.
The qualification round was won by Kostadinova with a clear margin of three points from Xiao Jiaruixuan. The next eight shooters were separated by just three points, with five shooters scoring 584. Their tie was broken by the most inner 10s, which qualified Kim Min-Jeong for the last spot in the final while Zorana Arunović was eliminated with only one inner 10 less.
In the final Kostadinova started poorly by missing all five targets in the first round but she fought back, only to finish an unlucky fourth after losing the shoot-off for bronze against Xiao. Both Kostadinova and Xiao had eliminated Wu Chia-Ying in a three-way shoot-off one round earlier. After 40 shots and winning two shoot-offs Xiao secured bronze. As the two remaining competitors Batsarashkina and Kim also tied after 50 shots, gold was also determined in a shoot-off, which was won by Batsarashkina 4-1. Batsarashkina won her second gold medal in Tokyo after having also won the 10 m air pistol, and followed Yang Qian as the second shooter to win two gold medals at these Games, but with her silver medal from the 10 m air pistol mixed team event, Batsarashkina became the most decorated shooter in Tokyo.

But during the 1968 season a new talent had arisen, Bob Beamon, who was undefeated in pre-Olympic competition. The thin air of Ciudad de México was expected to produce big jumps, and it did, but nobody was prepared for what was to come. In the qualifying Boston set an Olympic record with 8.27 (27-1¾).
The fourth jumper in the final was Beamon, and he had no marks to aim at as the first three jumpers had fouled. Beamon tore down the runway, hit the takeoff board perfectly, and took off, reaching a huge height. He came down hard and bounded out of the pit. Watching, Boston commented to Davis, “That’s over 28 feet,” but Davies felt that was not possible. Boston was actually conservative. The jump was over 29 feet – 29-2½ or 8.90, to be exact. The world record, held by Boston and Ter-O was 8.35, or 27-4¾; thus, Beamon had surpassed it by almost two feet. It was the largest single improvement in a track & field world record ever, and stunning athletic feats since that date are often labeled “Beamonesque.” The mark was so spectacular that a book was written about this single athletic moment, called The Perfect Jump, written by Dick Schaap in collaboration with Beamon.
The competition was over. Davies told Boston, “We can’t go on. We’d look silly.” Ter-Ovanesyan commented to Davies, “Compared to this jump, we are children.” After the jump, Beamon was not really sure what he had accomplished, not understanding the metric measurement. But when he was told it was 29-2½, he collapsed to his knees and became dizzy, having to be helped up by Boston and teammate Charlie Mays.
Eventually the long jump went on. Boston completed his medal set by winning a bronze. The great trivia question is the identity of the silver medalist – Klaus Beer of East Germany. Beamon took one more jump, 8.04 (26-4½), then passed his final four rounds, as they were not necessary. Lynn Davies tied for eighth after three jumps, and was mistakenly not advanced to the final three rounds of jumps. When officials realized what had happened, they offered him three more jumps. He refused, shattered by what he had seen.
There have been naysayers since. The wind reading was 2.0 metres per second, the exact limit of legal, and some observers think the jump may have been wind-aided, but no protests to its legality as a record were ever made. The mark stood up for 23 years, finally bettered in 1991 by Mike Powell, who jumped 8.95 (29-4½) to win the 1991 World Championships. As of 2022, Beamon’s mark is still the second longest legal jump ever, and still the Olympic record, probably for the foreseeable future as well. Beamon never jumped anywhere near as well again. He never had to.

Gutiérrez made it to the final in Sydney where he faced Russia’s Gaydarbek Gaydarbekov in one of the top bouts of the 2000 Olympics.

But this time they had great expectations for their excellent ski jumping team. The team was composed of four experienced jumpers, all of whom had shown good form early in the season. The big star was undoubtedly 28-year old Yukio Kasaya. He had taken a silver medal in the Normal Hill at the 1970 World Championships behind double gold medalist Gari Napalkov of Soviet. In the Four Hill’s Tournament at the beginning of the Olympic season, Kasaya had won the first three competitions. After that the Japanese team returned home to Japan to prepare for their home Olympics. Kasaya would probably have won the overall combined tournament easily, instead the Norwegian Ingolf Mork was the overall winner due to Kasaya’s absence in the fourth competition. Also the fact that all jumpers of the Japanese team came from Hokkaido made the local interest for the Normal Hill competition, three days after the opening of the Games, enormous.
After the first round the Japanese audience went wild: The Japanese quartet held the first four positions! Kasaya made a perfect jump of 84.0 m, the longest of the day, but was closely followed by Seiji Aochi, who jumped 83.5 m. In third place was Akitsugu Konno from Sapporo, followed by the fourth Japanese, Takashi Fujisawa, the silver medalist in the Large Hill from the World Championships in Oslo six years earlier. Best of the non-Japanese jumpers was the Swede Rolf Nordgren followed by another surprise man, the 19-year old Pole Wojciech  Fortuna.
The Japanese team was under great pressure from the home crowd before the start of the second round. Kasaya kept cool, had the best jump of all in the second round and won by a margin of almost 10 points. Konno made the second best jump of the second round and advanced to silver, and Aochi secured a clean medal sweep for Japan, the first in ski jumping since the Norwegian team made it in 1948. Only Fujisawa could not repeat his first jump, he missed totally and fell down from fourth to 23rd in the final ranking. Mork advanced from 14th after the first round, being the best non-Japanese in fourth place, and defending Olympic Champion Jiří Raška climbed from 13th to a final fifth place. Fortuna kept his sixth place from the first round, and the double World 1970 Champion Napalkov had to be content with a seventh place.
Kasaya and his teammates were celebrated as national heroes, Japan having avenged the disappointing results from their male speed skating sprinters in the 500 m from the day before.

The closer the group came to the stadium, the harder the attacks were pushed. The three Germans led the group into the stadium looking like clear winners if they could only run aside one another to block the Norwegians from getting through. But in the penultimate turn Rießle and Rydzek touched each other and the Norwegians ran through the small gap, with Graabak claiming gold and Moan taking silver.

The St. Louis Globe Democrat reported the results of that final as follows, “Scarcely had the men finished than Leary threw up his arms in the air and yelled to the officials on the float and in the stands ‘Foul.’ As soon as he could swim to the float, he did so and claimed that Halmay interfered with him near the finish and tried to pull him back. While it was acknowledged that Halmay’s course was the strongest in the world, all thoughts of his attempting to deliberately foul Leary were cast to the winds and the foul was disallowed. Up in the stands, however, the judges weren’t able to decide who won the event. One of the judges, a Hungarian, began to call Halmay the winner before he was within three yards of the finish and finally selected his countryman as the winner.

They defended their World title in 1955, this time in an extremely close contest with a pair which represented the European “classical style”, Sissy Schwartz and Kurt Oppelt from Vienna. Schwartz/Oppelt showed excellent form two weeks before the 1956 Olympics by winning the European title in Paris with a very impressive program.
The pair skating event in Cortina 1956 turned out to be a very controversial competition. It started after the performance of the young German couple, Marika Kilius (only 12) and Franz Ningel (19). The audience was very dissatisfied with the judges and started to throw oranges and other items into the ice. The competition had to be stopped for 45 minutes to calm down the audience and clean the ice.
In a very close contest, Schwartz/Oppelt won the gold medal with the scantest possible margin. Their Canadian rivals Dafoe/Bowden made an outstanding program, but faltered on a lift, causing them to finish after their music ended. The Nagy siblings from Hungary, Marianna and László, repeated their placing form Oslo 1952, winning another Olympic bronze medal.
European critics claimed that the Canadian pair’s overhead lifts was not covered in the rules and accordingly not permitted, but this view was strongly opposed by the North Americans. The discussions continued after the World Championships in Garmisch-Partenkirchen one week later, which ended with another close victory for the Austrian couple. Five out of nine judges had Schwartz/Oppelt in first place, the remaining four went for Dafoe/Bowden.

Close on his heels would be Kim Un-Guk of North Korea, the 2010 World Champion and 2011 runner-up. The reigning European Champion two years running, Bünyamin Sezer of Turkey, was competing in the lightweight division in London, giving his compatriot Erol Bilgin Europe’s best shot at a podium spot.
In the snatch portion of the event, Kim set an Olympic record and tied the world one with a lift of 153 kg, eight more than his closest competitor, Eko Irawan of Indonesia, who had been the bronze medalist at the Games in 2008 and runner-up at the 2009 World Championships. Kim’s first success in the clean and jerk, 170 kg, all but put him outside of striking distance of any other weightlifter. Irawan moved into second place with a lift of 172 kg on his first attempt. Zhang, who had only scored 140 kg in the snatch, lifted 174 kg on his first attempt, leaving him in the bronze medal position. Kim countered with a 174 kg lift of his own, failing at first, but then succeeding in his final attempt, giving him a new total of 327 kg and surpassing Zhang’s world record of 326 kg. Meanwhile Oscar Figueroa of Colombia, 2006 Pan American Champion, 2006 world runner-up, and two-time Olympic veteran lifted an Olympic record 177 kg on his third attempt, which tied Irawan’s score and placed him in second as the lighter weightlifter (but still 10 points shy of Kim’s gold). Zhang, meanwhile, was unable to lift the 178 kg he would have needed for the silver medal and finished fourth.

Italy’s Paola Magoni had been tied for fourth on the first run, but posted the best time on the second run to win the gold medal in a major upset. She had never previously placed better than sixth in a World Cup event, and would never again reach such heights, winning one World Cup race, a slalom in 1985, and earning a bronze in the slalom at the 1985 World Championships.The silver medal was won by Perrine Pelen, who had previously won Olympic bronze medals in the 1980 and 1984 giant slalom. Pelen was much better known and would have a much more heralded career.

In the following years his form dipped noticeably as he moved in weight to the bantamweight division and there were rumours that he had forsaken training for partying. At the beginning of 1996 everything seemed to click back into place for the Hungarian and in April he won the European Championships, his first major title since before the 1992 Games.  Kovács made serene progress through the tournament and reached the final without ever being but under strong pressure. The same could be said of his two greatest rivals up until the semi-final stage but Raimkul Malakhbekov, the world champion from Russia and Cuban veteran Arnaldo Mesa were then involved in a ferocious battle for the other place in the final which was only resolved in a victory for Cuban on count back after a 14-14 tie.  Mesa had not been due to compete in this weight category but the defection of reigning Olympic champion Joël Casamayor to the United States caused Cuba to restructure their team.
The first round of the final was a tepid affair with the Hungarian cautiously edging into a small lead but the second round was very different and proved to be a tour de force for Kovács  as he picked off the onrushing Mesa seemingly at will and cruised into a seven point lead that could not be pegged back. He became the first Hungarian to win an Olympic boxing gold since the Munich Games of 1972.
Kovács resisted the temptation to turn professional straight away in order  to contest the 1997 World Championships which were to be held in Budapest. After duly winning that title he stepped into the professional ranks and went on a run of 19 successive victories which included a victory in a fight for the European title. In his 20th fight he won the vacant WBO world title but his reign as Hungary’s first professional world title holder was brief as he lost the title on his first defence to fellow Atlanta medallist Pablo Chacón.

USA Basketball responded by hiring Jerry Colangelo, a former NBA coach, to lead Team USA and Colangelo hired Duke basketball coach Mike Krzyzewski, who instituted a team program concept. This worked with a gold medal at the 2008 Olympics and in 2010 the USA won the World Championships for only the second time ever. Led by NBA stars Kobe Bryant, LeBron James, Kevin Durant, Carmelo Anthony, and Chris Paul, the USA was favored in London, but they knew that they could be beaten if they did not play well, as Spain, Russia, and Argentina had several NBA players on their teams.
But that never happened, although they were challenged. In group play the United States punished Nigeria 156-73, setting all sorts of Olympic records, including most points in a game, and margin of victory. But their next game was against Lithuania and this was close until late in the fourth quarter, before the USA pulled ahead to win 99-94. In the knock-out round, the United States easily defeated Australia and Argentina to reach the final against Spain. Spain had beaten Lithuania in the quarters and Russia in the semis.
The final was close throughout, with the USA pulling out to an early lead, only to see Spain come back in the second period and cut the lead to only one at the half, 59-58. It stayed that way after three quarters, but the US was too strong in the final few minutes and won the gold medal, 107-100. The bronze medal went to Russia, who defeated Argentina 81-77.

50000,"Individual, Men",1912 Summer Olympics,6,Modern Pentathlon,/editions/6/sports/MPN,7 – 12 July 1912,"Kaknäs, Djurgården, Stockholm / Stockholms Olympiastadion, Stockholm / Simstadion, Djurgårdsbrunnsviken, Stockholm / Östermalms Idrottsplats, Stockholm / Rinkeby",32 from 10 countries,Point-for-place scoring.,na,"The modern pentathlon is a sport proposed by the founder of the Modern Olympic Games, Baron Pierre de Coubertin. He envisioned a competition which would determine the greatest all-around sportsman, similar to the pentathlon of the Ancient Olympic Games, as described by Aristotle, “The most perfect sportsmen, therefore, are the Pentathletes because in their bodies strength and speed are combined in beautiful harmony.”
But Coubertin’s all-around competition differed greatly from the Ancient Pentathlon, which consisted of the long jump, discus and javelin throwing, a sprint race of about 200 metres, and wrestling. At the 1909 IOC Session in Berlin, he first proposed the modern pentathlon, which was then noted to consist of “… equestrian, running, jumping, swimming, and wrestling. Fencing or shooting could replace wrestling.”
It was not until the 12th IOC Session at Budapest in 1911 that Coubertin’s idea was accepted by the IOC Membership. He stated, “I had already submitted the idea to the IOC on two previous occasions, and my proposal had always been greeted with a lack of understanding and almost hostility. I had not insisted. This time however the grace of the Holy Sporting Ghost enlightened my colleagues and they accepted an event to which I attached great importance: a veritable consecration of the complete athlete, the modern pentathlon was to comprise a foot-race, a horse-race, a swimming race, a fencing match, and finally, a shooting contest, which I would prefer to have had replaced by a rowing race, but this would have added greatly to the difficulties of the organization, which was already quite complicated enough.”
At that 1911 IOC Session, there was some concern on the part of the Stockholm organizers about providing horses for the competitors. Lyberg wrote, “The matter of the horses to be used started a heated discussion. Viktor Gustaf Balck had reported that the organisers could not provide horses to the competitors. De Coubertin got very upset. This competition was ‘his baby’ and told Balck that he and his friends had badly misunderstood his intentions. As not all competitors could bring their own horses the only solution was that the organisers must supply all with horses and that a draw was to be made for the horses. Balck was not happy but promised to provide the horses!)
The 1912 modern pentathlon consisted of rapid-fire pistol shooting, épée fencing, a 300 metre swimming race, a cross-country steeplechase equestrian event, and a 4,000 metre cross-country run. Probably better termed the military pentathlon, a press release from the UIPMB (Union Internationale de Pentathlon Moderne et Biathlon) described the choice of the events, “The choice of the five diverse and unrelated sports which make up the Modern Pentathlon arose out of the romantic, rough adventures of a liaison officer whose horse is brought down in enemy territory; having defended himself with this pistol and sword he swims across a raging river and delivers the message on foot.”
The 1912 Olympic modern pentathlon was the first time the event was ever contested, with the exception of Olympic trials in Sweden shortly before the Olympics. Because of its military imagery, most of the competitors were military officers. Many of the competitors also came to the modern pentathlon from other sports, using their skills in those sports to aid their training for the combined event. At Stockholm, 12 of the 32 modern pentathletes competed in another sport during the Olympics. The oldest participant in 1912 was Carl Pauen (GER) who was born on 7 April 1859 and was thus 53 years old in 1912. He retired, for reasons not known, after the first event, the shooting.
Sweden trained athletes specifically for the modern pentathlon in 1912, and their athletes dominated, as would be expected from their training. They entered 12 athletes, and Swedes finished in the first four places, six of the top seven, and seven of the top nine. Scoring was by a point-for-placed system for each of the five separate competitions.
The first event was shooting and three Swedes led, with Gösta Åsbrink winning the event with 20 hits, no misses, and 193 points. His teammates, Georg de Laval and Gösta Lilliehöök finished 2nd and 3rd. Swimming was held on the 2nd day, and de Laval and Åsbrink were equal 1st with 5 points after the swim competition ended. The best swim time was made by Ralph Clilverd (GBR) who swam the 300 metres in 4:58.4.
The 3rd and 4th days of the competition were devoted to the round-robin épée fencing. The best performance in fencing was by Sweden’s Åke Grönhagen, who won 24 of 26 matches. After three events, Georg de Laval led with 15 points, Lilliehöök second with 18 points, Åsbrink third with 20 points, and Clilverd in fourth with 22 points.
Georg de Laval maintained his lead after the riding competition. He finished third in the riding, for 18 points after four events, and a four-point lead over Lilliehöök going in to the final cross-country run. The riding was also won by Grönhagen, who moved up to 3rd place with 25 points.
After four events, Gösta Åsbrink was in fourth place with 27 points. He won the final event, the 4,000 metre run in 19:00.9, to finish with 28 points, but it was not enough. Gösta Lilliehöök finished 5th in the run to beat Åsbrink by one point, 27-28, and win the first Olympic modern pentathlon. Georg de Laval finished 12th in the run to fall to third place overall. In addition to his gold medal, Lilliehöök was awarded possession of the Challenge Trophy for the modern pentathlon, which had been donated for the Stockholm Olympics by de Coubertin.
The first non-Swedish finisher was an American, Lieutenant George Patton, who finished fifth, and later became a very famous American general.  Patton attended college at the United States Military Academy at West Point (NY), where he competed in football, track, fencing, and shooting, graduating in 1909. He also excelled as a horseman in the military. His all-around athletic prowess made him a natural to compete in an event such as the modern pentathlon. He never came close to winning, because his worst event was the first one, the shooting, and it put him hopelessly behind. He scored only 150 points, finishing in 21st place. But in the remaining four events, he finished seventh, fourth, sixth, and third, to move up into fifth place overall.
As a military man, Patton wrote a summary of his competition in the modern pentathlon, and this has been well chronicled by Harold “Rusty” Wilson, Ph.D. in “A Legend in His Own Mind: The Olympic Experience of General George S. Patton, Jr.”  In Wilson’s article, Patton’s actual performances are compared to those of Patton’s report. To be kind, it is obvious that Patton exaggerated his performances in his report.
Lieutenant Patton was eventually promoted to General and served with honor in Northern Africa and Europe during World War II. He led the United States 3rd Army, fighting against Rommel’s Africa Corps, participated in the United States’ invasion of Sicily, and at the Battle of the Bulge. His career has been immortalized in several biographies and also in an Academy Award winning movie of his life, entitled simply “Patton”.
All of the 32 competitors at Stockholm were men, and through 1996, women’s modern pentathlon was not contested at the Olympics, although it has been a World Championship event since 1981 and women débuted in Olympic modern pentathlon at Sydney in 2000. But a British woman did attempt to compete in the 1912 modern pentathlon.
The story was first reported in the newspapers on 7 July 1912, oddly in the Louisville Courier-Journal.  The headline noted, “GIRL TO ENTER OLYMPIC GAMES. Miss Helen Preece, “Women’s Hope, To Take Part In The Contests To Be Held At Stockholm.”  Sections of this story are as follows:
LONDON, July 6. - Englishwomen are expecting Miss Helen Preece, a 15-year-old horsewoman, to accomplish great things at the Olympic games at Stockholm this month.
Miss Preece, who will be the only female representative at the games, has won fame here as an expert horsewoman and athlete generally, and her abilities are not [un]known in the United States.  At New York in November last, at the Madison Square Garden Horse Show, Miss Preece won outright the $1,000 gold cup, open to the world for riding, in addition to many other “blues.”
“I have entered for several contests there,” she said, “but my particular ambition is to carry off the first prize in the great competition.  That is a stiff proposition, I admit, since it includes five different events: A cross-country ride of 4,000 meters (about two and one-half miles); riding over a course of 5,000 meters; swimming 300 meters; fencing and shooting with a revolver at a target twenty-five meters distant.
“A formidable list, you will agree, and all have to be won, but father and friends, under whose guidance I am now undergoing quite an arduous course of training, seem to have every confidence in me, and, of course, I myself am enthusiastic.
“I have obtained special leave of absence from my school in Hertfordshire, and my day’s work now commences as early as 5 o’clock every morning, and only ends with bedtime at 8 o’clock.
“A varied program is mapped out for me each day, but it always includes riding, shooting, swimming, running and walking practice, and today I have been put on a special diet, also, so that I should be absolutely fit for the Pentathlon on July 11.
“The one thing that worries me is the fact that I shall be the only woman competitor in this particular contest; it may make me nervous.”
Referring to her New York visit, Miss Preece said:
“I had a great time out there.  Everybody was so good to me and I made many friends.  The American women are fine riders and their sportsmanship is great.  They seem to take a far greater active interest in sports generally than do the women in England.”
But Helen Preece was not allowed to enter the modern pentathlon and did not compete at Stockholm. Evidently she had trained for the modern pentathlon motivated by the fact that its rule book did not have a “gentlemen only” rule, as did the horse-riding rule book. Since Preece was primarily a rider, the modern pentathlon offered her a workaround. 
Preece’s Olympic ambitions were known in England well before the Courier-Journal USA article. For example, the 27 March 1912 edition of the London Standard published an article headlined, “ENGLAND’S GIRL CHAMPION, MISS PREECE’S OLYMPIC TASK, A MARVELLOUS CAREER”. The article stated, in part: “An English girl in her sixteenth year is about to enter the lists with the world’s best riders and athletes. She will figure among the hundreds of competitors in the Olympic games, open to the world, which will be held at Stockholm this summer.”
In addition, an article in The Tatler published on 3 April 1912 stated, in part: “Miss Helen Preece … is a fifteen-year-old schoolgirl who will ride, shoot, fence, and swim for England in the Olympic Games at Stockholm … Her special desire is to win the Pentathlon at Stockholm this summer, for which she is already training hard.”
Evidently Preece turned in a modern pentathlon entry form to the British Olympic Association (BOA). Robert de Courcy Laffan, Honorary Secretary of the BOA, wrote to the Stockholm organizing committee on 2 May 1912, “We have had an application from a lady to be allowed to enter for the Modern Pentathlon in the Olympic Games of Stockholm. I presume from your telegram of March 22nd stating that the Horse Riding Competitions are only open to gentlemen riders, that the Modern Pentathlon is not open to ladies. I do not however feel authorised to decide this question absolutely, and therefore beg to refer it to you for a definite decision.”
On 8 May 1912, Kristian Hellström, secretary of the Stockholm organizing committee forwarded a copy of the letter to Baron Pierre de Coubertin. Coubertin answered Hellström, presumably shortly thereafter, although the letter has no date:
“As to the Modern Pentathlon I am personnally [sic] opposed to the admittance of ladies as competitors in the Olympic Games. But as they are this time admitted as tennis players, swimmers etc. I do not see on what ground we should stand to refuse them in the Pentathlon. However, I repeat that I greatly regret the fact. Therefore I leave to you to decide and if you refuse or accept the engagement, I shall agree with you.”
Upon receipt of Coubertin’s letter, the Swedish Organizing Committee decided to put the matter to a vote. On 17 May 1912, the committee sent Laffen a letter: “With further reference to your favour of May 2nd, we beg to inform you that the Committee have decided, for various reasons, not to allow ladies to enter for the Modern Pentathlon in the forthcoming Olympic Games.”
Afterwards, Coubertin wrote of the situation in Revue Olympique, “The other day an application came signed by a neo-Amazon who wanted to compete in the Modern Pentathlon and the Swedish Committee, who was left free to decide in the absence of fixed legislation, refused that application.”
Thus, nearly two months prior to the Louisville Courier-Journal article, the refusal of Helen Preece’s modern pentathlon entry was communicated to the BOA. Although it is not clear when or how Preece was informed of the committee’s decision, the 23 May 1912 edition of Pearson’s Weekly published what appeared to be a letter from Helen Preece, which stated in part: “I am not sure if I was selected to ride for England in the Pentathlon in the coming Olympic Games, or if daddy entered me for it, but anyhow I mean to win if I can. The Pentathlon is not an ordinary kind of race; you have to be able to do all sorts of things well before you can compete in it.”
However, Laffen put the matter to rest for the public a few days later in a 31 May 1912 Sporting Life article, which stated, in part: “In one quarter it was suggested that there was a possibility of a lady competitor being included among the United Kingdom’s representatives. However, we can assure our readers that there is not the least likelihood of a lady being sent, and the Rev. Courcy de Laffan [sic], the hon. Sec. of the British Olympic Council, assured our representative yesterday that the rules laid down by the Swedish Olympic Committee precluded a lady from competing in the Modern Pentathlon.”
With her Olympic hopes dashed, Helen Preece continued her equitation career in England and emigrated to the USA prior to World War I. She married and with her husband set up a riding school in Aiken, South Carolina.

In their Olympic match against East Germany, the Soviet team bus was stuck in traffic and they were 90 minutes late for the match. The East Germans could have taken a forfeit, but elected not to, and the USSR won the match in five sets. Had the USSR defaulted, Czechoslovakia would have won the gold medal, and East Germany would likely have won a medal. After returning home, the supposedly amateur East German players received the same rewards from the government usually accorded to silver medalists.

Whitlock was hoping to add to the two golds he won at Rio in 2016, and since the Rio Games he had won two World Championships and one European gold medal.

Japan’s Kazuma Kaya immediately moved into the bronze medal position after a 14.900, and with the two men who finished joint second in qualifying, McClenaghan and Kohei Kameyama of Japan still had to perform, and one of them was likely to move into a medal position. McClenaghan slipped off in the early part of his routine and neither he or Kameyama could catch Kaya, so the final result saw Whitlock take his third Olympic gold, and second successive pommel horse gold, by just 0.183 points from Lee Chih-Kai.

Kuzin was definitively the king of cross-country skiing at Falun in 1954, also winning the 50 km. and winning a third gold medal as a member of the gold medal winning Soviet team in the relay.
Under difficult snow conditions, the rising Swedish star Sixten Jernberg, who placed fourth at the distance in Falun two years before, was in front after 10 km., six seconds faster than Hakulinen. The four Soviet skiers were all among the first seven. At 20 km. Hakulinen had taken the lead eight seconds ahead of Jernberg. Pavel Kolchin, a 26-year-old Soviet skier from Dynamo Moskva, was third, followed by his three teammates. Hakulinen, starting last of the favorites, increased his lead over the last 10 km. and won his second Olympic gold medal, 24 seconds ahead of Jernberg. Kolchin took the bronze medal, only one second ahead of another Soviet skier, Anatoly Shelyukin.

In the semi-finals, Veirman defeated Hugo Maximilian Kusick of Russia.  The other semi was closely fought with Kinnear holding off Butler by one length.

At the Olympics, however, the Netherlands had failed to move past the semi-finals, winning bronze in both 2006 and 2010. For Sochi, they had made the team pursuit a priority, dedicating training time to the event and assigning a specific pursuit coach. Earlier in the season, the Dutch had won all three races, and their individual performances in Sochi seemed to predict another victory. All other seven competing nations seemed capable of medalling, with the sole exception of France, especially as its strongest rider, Alexis Contin, was suffering from hyperthyroidism.
The Dutch dismissal of France in the quarter-finals was not surprising, but the fact that the US and Russia were soundly beaten by Canada and Korea respectively, was unexpected. Poland was the fourth semi-finalist, eliminating Norway. The Poles then faced the Netherlands in the semi-finals, and essentially threw in the towel, recording the slowest time of the field save France. The Koreans, led by Lee Seung-Hun, overcame the defending Olympic champions Canada to meet the Netherlands in the final. In that race, Korea kept equal pace with the Dutch for the first 3 laps, before being overwhelmed. The Dutch team didn’t slow down and broke the Olympic Record in 3:37.71. The Dutch victory had a minor blemish. Reserve skater Jorrit Bergsma, Olympic champion in the 10,000 m, withdrew from the team shortly before the final, apparently disappointed about not being allowed to race and earn a medal.
In the bronze medal final, Poland trailed Canada for most of the race. Canadian sprinter Denny Morrison faded near the end, allowing Poland to take the bronze. The Canadians later commented on Poland lacking a “go for gold” mentality and profiting by being less fatigued in the B final.

All medal candidates qualified, except for Ossi Blomqvist of Finland, who placed 5th in the first race, which saw Alex Hurd (CAN), Shozo Ishihara (JPN), and Tomeju Uruma (JPN) fall.
The final, too, got off slowly, none of the skaters wanting to take the lead. This resulted in a scene similar to a team pursuit, with the leading skater swerving to the side at each turn. Only in lap 9 the skaters began to pick up the pace, but the eight kept together. With a lap and a half to go, the pack was lead by Eddie Murphy of the United States, ahead of Harry Smyth, Frank Stack, and Ivar Ballangrud. As they swung wide, fifth skater Irving Jaffee jumped away into the gap. Bernt Evensen followed him, but was then elbowed by Smyth. Evensen nearly fell, thereby obstructing his teammate Ballangrud. With both Norwegians off course, only Murphy managed to cling on to Jaffee. He remained in Jaffee’s tracks until the latter finally pulled away 10 yards before the finish. With Smyth awaiting a likely Norwegian protest, the Canadians filed a protest against Eddie Murphy, who supposedly had pushed Smyth, causing him to obstruct Ballangrud and Evensen. American referee Joseph K. Savage did not uphold the protest, and Jaffee was presented with the gold medal, Murphy taking silver and Willy Logan the bronze.
After four years, Irving Jaffee finally took revenge for the 1928 Olympics. A son of Russian immigrants, the New York skater contested his only international event in Sankt Moritz. After a 4th in the 5000 m, he was leading the 10000 m before it was annulled due to thawing ice conditions. Jaffee would not enjoy his gold medals for long, having to pawn them a few years later. The pawn shop itself went out of business, and the prizes were never recovered.

The morning start was held in mild weather conditions, but the forecast predicted colder weather during the day. However, this turned out to be completely wrong. One hour after the start the temperature changed completely, with the famous föhn wind coming from the south with the result that the temperature rose to 25° C. (77° F.) in the sun. This created big problems for the skiers, and it ended with one of the slowest 50 km. in the history of skiing, the winning time was one hour behind Thorleif Haug’s winning performance 4 years earlier.
The Norwegian Ole Hegge was in front in the first stage of the race, but at 15 km. Per-Erik Hedlund, a strong lumberjack from Särna, equaled Hegge’s intermediate time, and from then on the Swedes, apparently having done a better job with their skis, totally dominated the race. Hedlund, who was not able to finish the 50 km. in Chamonix four years earlier, opened up a substantial lead, at the 35 km. mark he was almost eight minutes ahead of his fellow countryman Gustaf Jonsson, followed by substitute Volger Andersson another 1:30 behind the leader. Hedlund took his time to stop and prepare his skis, certainly a wise decision, since he was then able to expand his lead substantially. The Norwegians and Finns were really struggling, Hegge was already almost 22 minutes behind the leader, slightly ahead of the best Finn, the eldest of the Lappalainen brothers, Tauno. They were both now behind the slow starting Norwegian Olav Kjelbotn, who had advanced from a modest 11th place to 4th, but without being able to catch up on the Swedish trio. Hedlund won the race with the biggest margin in Olympic skiing history, 13:27 ahead of silver medalist Jonsson, who was slightly ahead of the surprise bronze medalist, the substitute Andersson. The early leader Hegge struggled gallantly in to 5th place, over 25 minutes behind Hedlund, but was able to beat the best of the Finns, Tauno Lappalainen, by half a minute.
