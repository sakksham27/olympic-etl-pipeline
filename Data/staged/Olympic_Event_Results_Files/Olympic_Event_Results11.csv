Stanley Bacon won 15 British championships, and his other brothers brought the family total to 30.  He later competed at both the 1912 and 1920 Olympics, with less success.  In the semi-finals, George de Relwyskow (GBR) defeated Carl Andersson (SWE) on points, but the Swedish officials protested the decision, stating that Andersson had been the more aggressive wrestler.  The controversy while the protest was being considered led the final match to be held the next day.  Andersson then withdrew and refused to compete for the bronze medal.

The Americans were prohibitive favorites and they did not disappoint. Steve Clark led off the USA in 52.9, equalling the world record for the 100 free. Mike Austin and Gary Ilman swam the next two legs and gave Don Schollander a big lead, which seemed secure as he had won the 100 freestyle gold medal, but Hans-Joachim Klein, 100 free bronze medalist, actually outswam Schollander, posting the fastest split of the event in 52.4, to earn Germany the silver medal. Australia was a comfortable third over Japan.

The two favorites were Henry Taylor  and Frank Beaurepaire.  Taylor had won the mile race and finished 2nd in the 400 metres at the 1906 Athens Olympics.  He had won the Amateur Swimming Association (ASA) title at 440 yards in 1906-1907, but in 1908, Beaurepaire took the championship.  The defending Olympic champion at this distance was also present, the Austrian Otto Scheff.  The top American swimmer, Charlie Daniels, was entered in this event, but withdrew to save himself for the shorter distance sprint and the relay.
In the final, Taylor had the fastest start.  After one lap (100 metres in 1:15.0), Taylor, Beaurepaire, and Scheff were in a virtual dead heat.  The 200 metres was passed in 2:35 by Taylor, leading Scheff, who was clocked at 2:37.0.  Beaurepaire then came up quickly, and after 300 metres, he and Taylor were equal at 4:10.0.  But the effort exhausted the Australian as Taylor drew away to win by at least 5 yards.  Austria entered a protest in Scheff’s behalf, claiming that he was fouled in the final, but it was disallowed.

All went to plan until the semi-final when Savon, who had competed at super-heavyweight in 2012, was upset by Vasily Levit of Kazakhstan.
The final was the most controversial of the entire Rio boxing programme. Levit appeared to many to have been the busier and more accurate puncher throughout the bout but the Russian was awarded the victory with judges from Ireland, Colombia and Algeria voting 29-28 in favour of Tishchenko. Booing and hoots of derision echoed from both the Kazakh supporters and the neutrals in the crowd. This carried through to the medal ceremony where Levit had to gesture for them to quieten down and subdue their complaints.
The Kazakhstan Boxing Federation decided to reward Levit with $150,000, the same amount he would have won if he had won the gold medal.

Her biggest competition was expected to come from Nigerian Blessing Oborududu, who was competing in her third Olympics. Oborududu was the 2018 Commonwealth Games Champion and was a 10-time champion at the African Games. Also considered was the defending gold medallist from Rio, Japan’s Sara Dosho, although she was not seeded.
Things went as expected with both Mensah-Stock and Oborududu winning their early matches with ease and reaching the final. The final was close and well-fought, but Mensah-Stock prevailed for the gold medal, winning on points, 4-1.
The losing semi-finalists were Ukraine’s Alla Cherkasova and Mongolia’s Soronzonboldyn Battsetseg. Both repêchage finals were decided by falls, with Cherkasova taking down Dosho for one bronze medal. The other bronze match was somewhat of an upset as Soronzonboldyn, twice a World Champion although back in 2010 and 2015, lost by fall to Kyrgyzstan’s Meerim Zhumanazarova, although Zhumanazarova was the 2020 World Cup Champion.

They had finished 1-2 at the Worlds in 1985-87, Yekimov winning in 1985 and 1987 and Umaras winning in 1986. Because each nation could have only one competitor in this event, Yekimov was odd man out, leaving Umaras as a heavy favorite without him. But he was not the fastest qualifier, that going to East Germany’s Bernd Dittert. In the semi-finals Dittert lost to Australian Dean Woods, third at the 1986 Worlds, while Umaras easily handled Britain’s Colin Sturgess. In the final, Woods started quickly and led thru two kilometers. But Umaras caught him at 2,500 metres and pulled away to a three-second victory. After the fall of the Soviet Union, Yekimov would be allowed to turn professional and he became a top racer in the pro peleton, serving as a domestique for Lance Armstrong in several of his Tour de France victories (later voided when doping revealed). Yekimov would finally get an individual Olympic gold medal in 2000, winning the individual road time trial, although he had won gold in 1988 as a member of the Soviet pursuit team, and he would also repeat as gold medalist in the individual time trial in 2004.

He returned in 1995, placing at the 1995 Worlds, behind Angle. Angle and Jadidi met in the final, and neither wrestler could gain an advantage, the match going to overtime. It ended after eight minutes, with the score still tied at 1-1. The tie-breaker was number of passivity cautions, but both wrestlers had had only two such cautions, so it came down to an official’s decision. When the referee raised Angle’s hand, declaring him the gold medalist, Jadidi went to his knees and begged the officials to review the tapes and reverse the decision. They did not. Jadidi would go on to win the 1998 World Championships. Angle turned professional and became one of the top, and most popular, wrestlers in WWE.

Harrie Lavreysen (Netherlands), the recently crowned individual and team sprint champion, helped make the line-up an even stronger one, as did sprint bronze medallist Jack Carlin (Great Britain).
Perhaps surprisingly, Kenny, Büchli and Lavreysen failed to qualify for the quarter-final directly from their heats, but all three did get through following the repêchage, while all the other fancied riders qualified.
Kenny and Lavreysen both qualified from their quarter-final heat, as did Carlin and another favourite, Awang.
Jason Kenny was back to his best in winning his semi-final while his fellow Briton Carlin was eliminated in fourth place. Both Lavreysen and Awang also reached the final after finishing first and third in their semi-final respectively.
Kenny did not want to surrender the gold medal he won in Rio and made a rare sprint for the line immediately after the derny pace bike peeled away three laps from home. He soon built up a quarter-lap lead over the rest of the field as a result of his surprise tactics. He held that lead and ended up as champion for the second time, winning by 0.763 from the 2016 bronze medallist Awang, with the reigning world champion Lavreysen taking bronze, his third medal of the Games.
Victory for Kenny made him the most decorated British Olympian of all time with seven gold medals, one more than fellow keirin specialist Chris Hoy, and Kenny’s overall total of nine medals put him one ahead of Bradley Wiggins.

Once again the favorites were the Soviet Union and Japan. Japan had won the World Championships in 1974 and the Soviet Union had won the last five European Championships. In the end, Japan absolutely dominated the tournament. They defeated the Soviets in the final, crushing them in straight sets, 15-7, 15-8, 15-2. Japan played five matches and never lost a set, the only time this has happened in Olympic volleyball, and only one team (Korea) even reached double figures in any set (15-13 in the first set in the semi-finals). Nine of the Japanese players represented the Hitachi team, as did their coach, Shigeo Yamada. For the fourth straight Olympics, the gold and silver medals were won by Japan and the Soviet Union, who had now both won two gold and two silver medals. For the Soviets, Inna Ryskal had played on all four medal-winning teams. Through the first 40 years of Olympic volleyball, she is the only player to have won four medals.

Late in 2007 Manaudou’s preparations for Beijing were hampered by the publicity generated by the leak onto the internet of an intimate video showing Manadou and boyfriend Luca Marin. The scandal was elevated by the fact that Manadou and Marin had now broken up and he was now in a relationship with Pellegrini.
Another factor in the equation for Beijing was American’s Katie Hoff who was being touted in the media as “the female Michael Phelps” and was expected to challenge for six medals at the Games. Hoff took the initiative by setting an Olympic record in her heat but it only lasted a matter of minutes before Pellegrini set a new mark. Manadou also made the final but only as the slowest of the eight qualifiers.
For the first part of the race no one appeared willing to take on the pace. An attempt by Manadou to break clear soon floundered and it was not until after half way that the first serious move of the race took place. Katie Hoff pushed ahead and enjoyed a healthy lead with 50 metres to go but as she faded the rest of the pack closed up and in the final strokes Becky Adlington of Great Britain burst through to win the gold medal. Adlington, who was known more for the performances over 800 metres, had never been better than fourth before the final turn but timed the final sprint to perfection to become the first British swimming champion since 1988. Another Briton, Jo Jackson, placed third with Pellegrini paying the price for a slow start back in fifth.

She would face tough competition, from the season’s winners in World Cup races: namesake and teammate Yang Yang (S), and South Koreans Go Gi-Hyun and Choi Eun-Gyeong, who had placed 1-2 in the 1,500 m.
The race was pretty much a copy of the 500 m. Again, Yang (A) led from start to finish, holding off a competitor (Go) and a teammate (Yang (S)) for the title. Her victory marked the first time a short track skater won two individual gold medals at the Olympics

Huge for the era at 183 cm (6-0) and 85 kg (182 lbs), “The Gentle Giant” had been favored for gold medals in Tokyo but won only two silvers in the 100 fly and the medley relay, and she had failed to medal in Mexico City in the 100 fly. But in the 200 metres she came through, swimming what Swimming World described as “a beautiful race”. She started out at a measured pace, and was only third at 150 metres, trailing East Germany’s Helga Lindner and West Germany’s Heike Hustede, with American Ellie Daniel in fourth.

It was only the fifth medal sweep by a nation in women’s athletics at the Olympics and the first time this had ever happened in the 100. On paper the event was expected to be between the Jamaican and US sprinters, and the two nations sent all six of their athletes to the final, joined by Debbie Ferguson-McKenzie (BAH) and Jeanette Kwakye (GBR). In the final, Americans Torri Edwards and Muna Lee froze at the start, thinking there was a false start. But there was no recall and they were  hopelessly behind. Edwards would finish last while Lee pulled herself up to fifth. The best starters were Simpson and Fraser and they were clear early, Simpson leading slightly. But Fraser had the best finish, pulling away to an easy victory. The photo could not separate Stewart and Simpson who were both given silver medals, with American Lauryn Williams in fourth.

As Spain was already placed as the host nation, ninth placed France also was invited. The changes in Eastern Europe meant that the Unified Team played instead of the USSR, and the DDR had been merged into Germany. UN sanctions meant that Yugoslavia couldn’t compete, and they were substituted by Iceland, 10th at the Worlds. The continental qualifiers were Egypt, Cuba and South-Korea, but Cuba forfeited its spot, boycotting Seoul, allowing Brazil to make its Olympic début.
In the pool phase, the Swedish World Champions displayed superiority, winning all pool matches with relative ease. More remarkable was the performance of tiny Iceland. The small nation, substituting for Yugoslavia, only lost to Sweden, drew Czechoslovakia and earned a narrow but deserved win over 1988 silver medallist South Korea (26-24). This earned them second place in their pool, and thus a spot in the semis. The picture in the other pool was quite similar: the former Soviets, who had lost the 1990 World Championships final, won all their pool matches. Their only difficult match was against France, the surprise of pool B, defeating Spain in their first match (18-16) and losing narrowly against the Unified Team (23-22).
In the semi-finals, a sensation was in the air, as the Icelandic underdogs were leading 16-15 15 minutes into the second half. But they were eventually defeated by the strong ex-Soviets, Talant Duyshebayev netting nine goals. In the other match, Sweden led France comfortably (20-14) but saw their lead disappear quickly in the last part of the match. The French came to within one goal (23-22) but ultimately were defeated 24-22.
In a rematch of the 1990 World Championship final, the first half remained tied at 9 each. Sweden appeared to distance itself from the Unified Team in the second half (14-12), but this was overcome quickly, and the former Soviet squad won its third title, after 1976 and 1988. In the bronze medal match, the two surprise semi-finalists battled it out, France ending up on the podium.

In her absence, no USA runner was considered a medal threat.
Thompson-Herah was the defending champion, also having won the 200 gold medal in Rio, while Fraser-Pryce had won gold in this event in 2008 and 2012, but was still formidable, having recently run 10.63, a PR, and she had been the 2019 World Champion. Fraser-Pryce had beaten Thompson-Herah at the Jamaican Olympic Trials.
All the favorites made it through the heats, but Asher-Smith did not qualify out of the semi-finals, blaming a hamstring injury that would keep her out of the 200, in which she was the pre-Olympic favorite. The times in the rounds were fast, with Ta Lou running 10.78 in her heat, and Thompson-Herah running 10.76 in the first semi-final, only to be topped by Fraser-Pryce’s 10.73 in the third semi.
Thompson-Herah and Fraser-Pryce were lined up in adjacent lanes and both got quick starts, but Thompson-Herah maintained her speed longer and finished a stride ahead of her rival / teammate, recording 10.61, with Fraser-Pryce finishing in 10.74. Behind them Shericka Jackson completed the sweep for Jamaica, as Ta Lou was just off the podium.
Thompson-Herah had defended her gold medal, and a few days later she would also defend the 200 title from Rio. Her time of 10.61 was the second fastest ever run, trailing only the world record set by Florence Griffith Joyner at the 1988 US Olympic Trials. Thompson-Herah ran into a 0.6 m/s headwind, however, and athletics statheads considered this the fastest time ever run, under all conditions, correcting for wind and altitude.

Canadian David Ford was the reigning World Champion, while Paul Ratcliffe was the 1998 European champion. Ratcliffe placed the highest among all these three in the qualifying round, but was still behind Mathias Röthenmund of Switzerland and Thomas Schmidt of Germany. Ferrazzi was 11th and Ford was 22nd and thus suffered elimination. Schmidt was in first after the first run of the final, with Ferrazzi in second, Ratcliffe in third, and Röthenmund in ninth. Schmidt won the second run as well and thus guaranteed himself gold, while Slovenia’s Dejan Kralj was second. This was not sufficient to overcome his 12th-place run from the first round and thus Ratcliffe, who was third again, was able to claim the silver medal. Ferrazzi, meanwhile, was eighth but this was sufficient for him to earn bronze.

Ainslie then went on a tear, winning four of the next eight races, and finishing no worse than fourth in any of them to take a big lead going into the final race, where he raced conservatively and finished 14th, but won the gold medal comfortably over his training partner, Spain’s Rafael Trujillo. Bronze went to the 1996 gold medalist in Finn, Poland’s Mateusz Kusznierewicz.
This was Ainslie’s third Olympic medal, after winning silver and gold in Laser in 1996 and 2000, respectively, but it was also the first of three consecutive golds he would win in the Finn class.

Europe was well represented by the reigning European champion, Aimé Escudie of France and Ireland’s Micheal McKeon. Home favourite Johnny Wright, a 19-year-old sailor with just a few months experience at this weight, beat the European silver medallist, Wally Thom, just to qualify for the British team and Hungary’s László Papp had remained undefeated since a defeat to Július Torma, who would win the welterweight title in London, in 1947. Adding in the highly touted American, Washington Jones, and the tough Uruguayan, Dogomar Martínez and the expectation of a memorable tournament was hard to suppress.
The first of the favourites to fall was Jones, victim of what was seen to be a harsh disqualification for “hitting with an open glove” against his Belgian opponent, Auguste Cavignac, in a second round bout. Cavignac failed to last a round against Papp in the quarter-finals but the other three bouts all went the full distance. The victory of Micheal McKeon over Escudie was one of the most fiercely contested fights of the entire Games both inside and outside of the ring. The French officials resigned in protest after the bout after McKeon was awarded the win. The Irishman followed this with another brutal contest against Johnny Wright in the last four. Wright won the decision but both men were left bloodied and bruised. Papp came through his half of the draw with three overwhelming victories and was the fresher man for the final. Although he was not yet the fighter he would come to be in the next decade, the Hungarian was superior to the Englishman and would take his first Olympic title.
Bela Keri, trainer to both Papp and fellow Hungarian gold medallist, Tibor Csik, promised that if both men took Olympic titles he would jump fully clothed into the nearby swimming pool. The next morning the Hungarian newspapers showed a very wet coach on their front page. Bronze medallist Ivano Fontana of Italy and the Dane, Martin Hansen, went to achieve a modicum of success in the pro ranks.

In the first semi Italy rallied to beat world champions Russia by 45-42 whilst the encounter between France and the USA was even more dramatic. With the scores level at 44 apiece Damien Touya of France and Keeth Smart of the US were left to contest the deciding hit. Both men lunged forward and scored simultaneous hits which meant that the contest was to continue. However, in the process of striking Touya, Smart’s blade pierced Touya’s right glove and went through into his hand. The Frenchman received medical treatment and, after a ten minute delay, resumed the bout. Twice more the men scored simultaneous hits until, at the fourth attempt, Touya struck the decisive score.
It looked possible that Damien Touya might be forced to miss the final as a result of his injury but he was able to join forces with his brother Gael and Julien Pillet to face the formidable Italian team which included individual champion [Aldo Montano] (/athletes/106021). Montano retained the sparkling form he had shown earlier in the Games but his teammates could not match him and it was left to Damien Touya to fight back against Luigi Tarantino to order to seal gold.

His compatriot, 2018 World Champion Charles Hamelin was in Beijing, but was not selected for the 1,000 m. The 2019 champion, Im Hyo-Jun had been suspended by the Korean federation over a sexual harassment conviction (which was later overturned), and while he had joined the Chinese team and was hoping to race as Lin Xiaojun, his nationality change was not submitted in time to compete for a different NOC than in 2018.
The 2021 World Champion, Shaolin Sándor Liu was present, as was his brother and world runner-up, Shaoang Liu. Other favorites included Hwang Dae-Heon and Ren Ziwei, who had both won World Cup races earlier in the season, as had Sándor.
Despite a flurry of disqualifications and advances in the heats and quarter-finals, most of the favorites reached the semi-finals. One casualty was Korea’s Park Jang-Hyuk. In his quarter-final, he collided with Pietro Sighel. While spinning on the ice, Wu Dajing skated into his hand, causing a serious injury that required 12 stitches, leaving him unable to race the semi-finals (to which he as advanced).
Hwang and Ren seemed to proceed from the first semi-finals, but Hwang was judged to have impeded Li Wenlong in his move overtaking Ren and Li, and was relegated. The second semi-final also ended badly for the South Koreans. The Liu brothers dominated much of the race, but after Lee June-Seo had overtaken Shaoang, he blocked the Hungarian’s attempt to comeback, and was also penalized.
This left the final a Chinese affair, with Ren, Li and Wu Dajing, as well as the Chinese-Hungarian Liu brothers. Wu was leading the race when it was halted, as a piece from of the skates of Li had broken off and damaged the ice. In the restarted race, Ren was the early leader, but was passed by Sándor Shaolin with four laps to go, at which point Wu and Shaoang had lost touch with the others. Liu only just held on until the finish line, crossing it falling and cheering. But after some agonizing minutes waiting for the referee to review the race, Liu was penalized for an overtaking infringement earlier in the race, giving Ren his second gold medal of the Games. As a minor consolation for Hungary, this moved Shaoang up to bronze.
Another notable competitor was Furkan Akar. The 19-year-old Turkish skater made his country’s first Olympic appearance in short-track. Benefiting from disqualifications in his heat and quarter-final, he eventually reaced the B-final, recording a remarkable sixth place in the final standings, the best ever for a Turkish competitor in any sport at the Olympic Winter Games.

Of the nine medals available at the Worlds in 1949-51, four had been won by Sweden, four by Finland, and one by Italy. The favorite in 1952 was Sweden’s Lars Hall, who had won the 1950 and 1951 World Championships. He was expected to be challenged by Finland’s Lauri Vilkko who had placed second in 1949 and 1951. Hall got off to a quick start, winning the cross-country steeplechase by 21 seconds over Finland’s Olavi Mannonen, while Vilkko lingered back in 11th place. Hall had drawn a horse that was found to be lame, and he was then re-assigned the best horse in the competition.
Hall placed seventh with the épée in the second phase, but fell behind Hungary’s István Szondy, who was third in riding, and fourth in fencing. Hall struggled in rapid-fire shooting, placing 15th. Szondy was only 12th with the pistol but remained tied for the lead with his teammate, Gábor Benedek, with Hall in third place, four points behind the Hungarian duo. Hall’s troubles in shooting were nothing to those of Vilkko, who placed only 38th and took himself out of medal contention. Hall was fortunate that he could shoot at all as he arrived late to the pistol range, but a Soviet protest had delayed the competition and kept him from being disqualified.
Lars Hall was easily the best swimmer in the competition and he won the 300 metre freestyle by over six seconds. This gave him a lead he would not relinquish. Placing eighth in the run, he won the gold medal by seven points over Benedek, with Szondy taking the bronze medal. Benedek and Szondy would finish 1-2 at the 1953 World Championships. Hall was a carpenter and became the first civilian to win the pentathlon. One interesting competitor was Australian Forbes Carlile, who later became the coach to Australian swimming superstar Shane Gould.

They were led by Usain Bolt, who had won the 100-200 double in both 2008 and already in London. Yohan Blake had been second to both races in London and was the 2011 World Champion in the 100. They were without former 100 world record holder Asafa Powell, injured in the 100 final, but would lead off with Nesta Carter and Michael Frater, and seemed impregnable. The Americans had Tyson Gay, the 2007 100/200 World Champion, and Justin Gatlin, 2004 Olympic 100 gold medalist and third in the short sprint in London, but they just didn’t seem to have the firepower to challenge the Jamaicans. In addition, US sprint relay teams had shown a frequent propensity to either drop the baton or run out of the zone and had not finished at several recent major internationals. Nobody else was given a chance at gold and the bronze was wide-open.
Carter put the Jamaicans ahead on the opener, with American Trell Kimmons trailing slightly. The race was very close, however, for the next two legs, as Gatlin/Frater matched second legs in 8.9, and Gay/Blake both ran 9.0 around the final curve. But this gave the lead to Usain Bolt on the anchor leg, to be challenged by American newcomer Ryan Bailey, who had been fifth in the open 100 metres. Bailey acquitted himself well, but he could not catch Bolt. The USA finished in 37.04, matching the existing world record, but Bolt brought Jamaica home in 36.84, the first time ever under 37 seconds for the gold and a new world record. Canada came home in third, it seemed, but was disqualified for a lane violation and the bronze went to Trinidad & Tobago.
Jamaica thus defended its gold medal in the event, and Bolt had doubled up with three gold medals in the 100, 200, and sprint relay in both 2008 and 2012, the first runner ever to do so (Jamaica’s 2008 relay gold would later be rescinded for doping violation by Nesta Carter). For the Americans it seemed to be some measure of redemption as they did successfully finish the race with good baton exchanges, but were simply beaten by a faster team. However, in 2014 Tyson Gay tested positive for doping, and his penalty was applied retroactively, which caused the US relay team in this event to be disqualified, although that was not announced by the IOC until May 2015.

Three teams of British policemen then competed against teams from the United States and Sweden in what was a very controversial competition.  In the first round the Liverpool Police team pulled the U.S. team “in a rush,” winning easily, with the Daily Graphic noting, “The United States remained as competitors for the shortest time on record.  The Liverpool Police pulled them over the line almost as soon as they threw their weight on the rope.”
The Americans then protested, claiming that the British were wearing illegal boots.  The Liverpool team offered to pull again in barefeet but the American team, which was comprised of specialists in the “heavy” field events, made no response and withdrew.  In the semi-finals Liverpool defeated Sweden, but were then easily defeated by a team of London City Policemen in the final.
The American protest did not die and received significant play in the press and, eventually, in the American and British responses to the multiple protests and criticisms made by the United States’ officials.  The American protest concerned the Liverpool footwear, which they considered illegal.  The pertinent rule, as listed in the program, was the following, “No competitor shall wear prepared boots or shoes or boots or shoes with any projecting nails, tips, sprigs, points, hollows, or projections of any kind.”  However, the policemen were wearing standard police boots, with metal rims, but no projecting studs or other items.  The protest must have considered this footwear as “prepared boots or shoes,” but it seemed to have little basis and was disallowed.
On 21 July 1908, The Sporting Life published the following letter directed to the American Olympic team.
“Sir,-In connection with the complaint made by the American tug-of-war team regarding the boots worn by the Liverpool Police team, I should like to state that the City of London Police team are prepared to make a match with the Americans before they return home, in which both teams shall pull in stockinged feet.  The match might take place at the Stadium on Wedneday or Thursday, and the City Police would be willing to pull for anything the Americans like in the way of a prize, or for nothing at all.  We do not wish the Americans to go back home dissatisfied with their beating, and we therefore give them this opportunity of showing if they are as capable “tuggers” as they claim to be.-I am, &c.,
H. DUKE
Captain City Police Team
London, July 20.”
The next day, The Sporting Life, ran the following short paragraph, which should have closed out the discussion, “Mr. Duke, who captained the winning team in the tug-of-war, has been provoked into issuing a challenge in reply to the complaint about the boots of the men of whom he is so proud.  They are sportsmen to the backbone, but the incident must be considered closed by the statement of a member of the U.S.A. team that they were satisfied with the result, and they knew that they had met better men at the game than themselves. ‘We know really nothing about tug-of-war,’ he said, ‘and before we can hope to hold our own with such a clock-work team as you can put in the field we must have considerable practice.  Your men won easily, and they would win easily again, and what more need be said.  I have nothing to say, at any rate, and there will be no more pulling by us.’”
But certain American athletes surely considered the Liverpool footwear as illegal.  In the New York Evening World, the great American athlete Martin Sheridan wrote a column during the Olympics.  In one edition (18 July), his article was as follows:  “The American team was handed a real sour lemon here this afternoon when the tug-of-war event was announced.  When our men went into the Stadium for the event they wore regulation shoes, without spikes or projecting nails or tips, as laid down in the rules for the contest.  What was our surprise to find the English team wearing shoes as big as North River ferryboats, with steel-topped heels and steel cleats in the front of the soles, while spikes an inch long stuck out of the soles.  The Englishmen had to waddle out on the field like a lot of County Mayo ganders going down to the public pond for a swim.  The shoes they wore were the biggest things over here and were clearly made for the purpose of getting away with the event by hook as well as crook.”
The secretary of the Liverpool Police Athletic Society finally addressed the question of “prepared boots” in a letter to the British Olympic Association.
“The policemen who pulled in the tug-of-war against the American team in the Olympic Games wore their ordinary duty boots, as it is their invariable custom to pull in such boots which have gone too shabby to be worn on street duty.  The boots were not prepared or altered in any way.
Yours faithfully,
[Signed] J. PARK
October 26, 1908
Hon. Secretary: Liverpool Police Athletic Society”
Much of the American attitude must be attributed to James E. Sullivan, who was in charge of the American Olympic team, and who lodged the official protest.  In an article in The New York Herald he described “. . . the prepared shoes worn by the Liverpool policemen in the tug-of-war, and the work that dishonest officials did in the committee rooms.”  However, in A Reply to Certain Criticisms, it was noted, “The American athletes never wished, for instance, to protest against the tug-of-war.  They knew that they had been fairly pulled over in a game of which they were completely ignorant, and for which their manager should never have entered them.”

Ties broken by lightest bodyweight.,na,"There was no easy way to pick a favorite in the women’s heavyweight division of the weightlifting tournament at the 2012 Summer Olympics, which had three strong competitors vying for the crown. Nadezhda Yevstyukhina of Russia, holding the world record in the clean and jerk, was probably the most prominent among them, having won bronze at the 2008 Games and the 2007 and 2010 World Championships, silver at the 2006 World Championships and 2010 European Championships, and gold at the 2011 World and European Championships. Her compatriot Nataliya Zabolotnaya held the world record in the snatch and total points and had silver medals from the 2004 Olympics, the 2005, 2007, and 2010 World Championships, and the 2011 European Championships, along with five European titles (2003, 2006, 2008-2010). Finally there was Svetlana Podobedova of Kazakhstan, formerly of Russia, who had World Championship bronze from 2005, silver from 2011, and gold from 2004, 2005, 2009, and 2010 in addition to the 2010 Asian Games title.
After Yevstyukhina failed three times to snatch 125 kg, the remainder of the event became a ferocious exchange between Podobedova and Zabolotnaya that resulted in eight Olympic records being set of the course of competition. The Kazakh beat the old Olympic record in the snatch by 2 kilograms with a 130 kg lift, but was immediately overtaken by Zabolotnaya, who lifted 131 kg. No other competitor came close to this weight; Irina Kulesha of Belarus, who had a long history of finishing fourth that included the 2008 Olympics and the most recent two World Championships, was third with 121 kg. In the next phase, Zabolotnaya lifted 155 kg to set an Olympic record in the clean and jerk and total points, but Podobedova responded by lifting 156 kg. Zabolotnaya again reset both records, this time with a 160 kg lift, but Podobedova bested her again with a 161 kg lift. Their scores tied at the end, the Kazakh became Olympic champion by 0.22 kilograms, the difference in their weight in a tie-breaker where the lightest competitor would win. Kulesha finished in a distant third place, twenty-two kg behind the front runners, but finally on the podium.
That was how the event and the results seemed to have ended. In 2015, however, the IOC began re-testing samples from the 2008 Beijing and 2012 London Olympics, using newer, more advanced testing techniques, in an effort to find those who had used performance enhancing drugs (PEDs), but in whom it could not be detected at the time of those Olympics. This was one of the many events affected. Every women’s weightlifting event at the 2012 London Olympics, except flyweight (≤ 48 kg), was affected by positive re-tests.
All three medalists in this event ended up disqualified for positive re-tests. Svetlana Podobedova (KAZ) tested positive for stanozolol in October 2016, while Nataliya Zabolotnaya (RUS) and Irina Kulesha (BLR) had re-test positives for turinabol (dehydrochloromethyltestosterone) announced on 21 November 2016. The medals were re-assigned as follows: Gold – Lydia Valentín (ESP); Silver – Abir Abdulrahman (EGY); Bronze – Madias Nzesso (CMR). Valentín received her gold medal on 28 February 2019 at a special ceremony in Madrid.
Valentín especially benefited from the plethora of drug re-tests at the 2008-12 Olympics, having been moved up to a silver medal in this event in 2008. Kulesha also had a re-test positive for turinabol at this event at the 2008 Olympics. Valentín won a bronze medal in the event in 2016, without medal re-assignments, so, technically, “she won her third Olympic medal before she won her first two,” if that makes any sense.

Almost by default this left 200 metres specialist Andrey Korneyev, the European champion from Russia, as the man to beat. After the heats were concluded the landscape looked different again as the two Hungarians, despondent after the 100 metres, bounced back to set the two fastest times.
Korneyev gambled in the final and took the lead from the start. At halfway he was under world record pace but he began to tire quickly in the last 50 metres of the race. With 20 metres Korneyev and the two Hungarians were in one line in the middle lanes of the pool. Rózsa was the strongest of the trio and stormed ahead in the last strokes of the race to win by nearly half a second with Guttler edging past the Russian for silver.
Four days after the final it was announced that Korneyev had tested positive for the stimulant Bromantan and he would be stripped of his bronze medal thereby elevating Great Britain’s Nick Gillingham to third position. Korneyev appealed to the Court of Arbiration of Sport on the basis that the drug was not in fact a stimulant but merely an aid to boost the body’s immune system.

They were re-weighed after the competition, with Dembończyk getting the bronze medal, another example, as in the flyweight class, of a medal awarded because one guy sweated more than the other.

The gold medal by Nazarov was the first ever for Tajikistan at the Olympics, in any sport.
The silver medal was won by Belarussian Ivan Tikhon, who had, shall we say, a somewhat checkered past. Tikhon (sometimes spelled Tsikhan in Belarussian) had initially won silver at the 2004 Olympics, only to lose that for a later revealed doping positive when the samples were re-tested in 2012. At the 2008 Olympics he won a bronze medal only to see that withdrawn on a doping positive. After an appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS), Tikhon’s 2008 medal was restored.

He was expected to be challenged by the defending champion, Pyotr Bolotnikov, the 1962 European Champion, and twice a world-record setter, and the 1960 5K champion, Murray Halberg of New Zealand. Clarke set a fast pace, surging every other lap. At 5K, only five leaders remained, but it was not who was expected. Besides Clarke, the pack included Tunisia’s Mohamad Gammoudi, Ethiopia’s Mamo Wolde, Japan’s Kokichi Tsuburaya, and a surprise American, Billy Mills. Tsuburaya was dropped in the sixth kilometer. At the bell, Clarke led, with Mills to his outside. But a lapped runner was between them, so Clarke moved out, pushing Mills into an outer lane, as Gammoudi moved past them both on the inside, quickly opening up a 10-metre lead. Clarke moved up to Gammoudi’s shoulder at the top of the stretch and passed him, but Gammoudi fought back. Then suddenly, as if an apparition had come upon them, Billy Mills sprinted past both and won by three metres over Gammoudi, Clarke getting the bronze medal.
Mills was completely unknown prior to the race. Asked if he was concerned about Mills, Clarke replied, “Concerned about him, I never heard of him.” One Japanese reporter asked Mills, “Who are you?” His victory is often considered the greatest upset in Olympic track & field history. Mills was part Sioux Indian, and worked for years after his victory as an inspirational leader for the betterment of Native Americans. He was also given warrior status by the Oglala Sioux, and an Indian name – Makoce Teh’la.

Kőbán, like Idem-Guerrini, was a seasoned veteran, having won her first World Championship medal in 1985 and participated in her first Olympics three years later.
Brunet and Idem-Guerrini won their heats in the opening round, while Kőbán was second to the Italian. As expected, Brunet and Idem-Guerrini battled each other at the front of the pack for most of the final, but the latter pulled away in the final 100 metres and defeated the Canadian for her first time in the K-1 500, taking home her first Olympic title in five editions of the Games for her efforts.

There was no dominant American sprinter, as since Bernie Wefers had won three straight titles in 1895-1897, 12 different sprinters had claimed the AAU (Amateur Athletic Union) championship.  South Africa sent two good sprinters, Eddie Duffy and the 1907 South African champion, Reggie Walker.
The Olympic record was 10.8, having been set in 1900 by Frank Jarvis (USA) and Walter Tewksbury (USA).  The world mark was 10.6, set in 1906 by Sweden’s Kurt Lindberg.  Though Lindberg competed in this event, he failed to get by the first round, finishing second in heat eight to Lester Stevens (USA).
James Rector (USA) and Reggie Walker both equalled the Olympic record, Rector doing it in both rounds.  Walker’s record-equalling run came in the final when he beat Rector by one yard.  At 19 years, 128 days, he set a record, which still stands, of being the youngest ever winner of the Olympic 100 metres.
It is often stated that Walker was not actually a member of the South African team in 1908, but travelled to London on his own.  South African Olympic historian Lappe Laubscher has shown that this is not the case and that he was chosen for the team at the first opportunity.  He notes that Walker was recommended for the team on 1 May 1908 at a meeting of the South African Amateur Athletic and Cycling Union, but he initially could not make the trip because of a lack of funds.  Walker was a native of Natal and Jim Wallace, a Natal sportswriter, started a campaign to raise funds for Walker’s trip, which was successful.

Inspired by his coach, Juan Fontanilis, who was himself a native of that Caribbean island, he employed the same hit and run tactics that had proved so successful for Cuban boxers but with perhaps an even more defensive outlook.
Boonjumnong, a world championship bronze medallist on home soil in 2003, used these tactics to great effect in an upset quarter-final victory over France’s world champion Willy Blain and then to clinch Olympic gold against a genuine Cuban in  Yudel Johnson.
The Thai fighter’s success was celebrated widely in his homeland and, soon after the medals were presented, he received a personal phone call from the King of Thailand. Boonjumnong’s newborn son was named Athens in tribute to the site of his father’s triumph.  He also received donations from both government and private sources worth $600,000 which he reportedly then spent on partying and gambling. In 2006 the turmoils of his private life were briefly set aside as he won the Asian Games gold medal and he later spent time in a Buddhist monastery in an attempt to keep his focus on the retention of his title in Beijing in 2008.  This was to prove a step too far for him although he had the rare satisfaction of dispatching another Cuban fighter on the way to a silver medal.
American Rock Allen made little impact on the tournament but, unlike 2000, he did at least reach the Olympic arena. In 2000 he had been disqualified at the US trials for allowing his twin brother Tiger to weigh-in on his behalf.

He was lucky to be chosen for Rome after a poor riding phase at the Soviet Championship and, in the Italian capital city, Novikov placed only 33rd in riding with 982 points. He was over 250 points behind the leader and could not recover, eventually finishing fifth, despite a second in the swimming and winning the cross-country run.
With Novikov out of the medals, the competition eventually came down to the three Hungarian teammates, Ferenc Németh, Imre Nagy, and András Balczó, and American Bob Beck. They also struggled in the riding, but finished second, first, and sixth in fencing respectively. But the lead after the second phase was held by the Mexican pentathlete Antonio Almada, and after the third phase by his teammate, Sergio Escobedo, who was helped by his horse draw, winning that phase with a dominant performance. Balczó won the swimming, with Beck placing fourth and Németh sixth. Going into the cross-country run, Beck led, with Almada second, Németh third, Nagy fourth, and Balczó sixth. But Almada was a poor runner, and would finish 52nd in the cross-country. Beck was also not strong and would place 24th, falling back to the bronze medal, although he only missed the silver by three seconds and the gold by 15 seconds. The run was won by Novikov with Balczó second, but it was not enough for either to get to the medals – Balczó would finish fourth. Ferenc Németh placed seventh in the run but it was enough to move him up to the gold medal position, with Nagy following him in eighth in the run and winning the silver medal. Németh never won another major title, never competed at the World Championships, and never won a Hungarian national title.
Lars Hall, champion in 1952 and 1956, suffered a serious concussion when he fell from his horse at the Swedish Championship which meant his dreams of a third successive gold were ended.

East Germany, Romania, and the Soviet Union had finished in that order at the most recent European and World Championships, while the order had been East Germany, the Soviet Union, and Hungary at the 1961 Europeans. It was Romania, the Soviet Union, and Hungary, however, who met in the first heat of the opening round and finished in that order, while a unified Germany captured the other heat. Germany and Hungary were paired together in the semi-finals, which the former won by a significant margin, while the Soviets and the Romanians took the other heats. The final was a close affair, as expected, with only a second separating the first three finishers, the Soviet Union, Germany, and Romania. Hungary was a less than a second behind them in fourth. Romania’s Aurel Vernescu also took bronze in the K-1 1000, while Germany’s Holger Zander captured bronze in the K-2 1000.

A third coxswain, Enrico Pietropolli, had helped Baran and Sambo taken bronze at the 1966 World Championships. The Dutch were the reigning World Champions, but only one member of their Olympic lineup, Hadriaan van Nes, had been on the gold medal-winning squad. The defending Olympic champion nation of the United States sent Bill Hobbs, Richard Edmunds, and Stewart MacDonald.
The East Germans and the Italians dominated the opening round; the former had been runners-up at the most recent European Championships, but with a different lineup. The semi-finals were somewhat closer, with the Netherlands in particular improving their performance, but the field was still led by Italy and East Germany. In the final, the Dutch fought hard and were ahead for a good portion of the race, but they were eventually overtaken by the steady and forceful drive of the Italians, who went on to take the gold medal by a margin of almost two seconds. The Netherlands settled for silver, while East Germany duked it out with Denmark for bronze, the latter of whom emerged victorious with only 0.15 seconds to spare.

The Soviet skater improved it to 41,2 two weeks later at the National Championships, with Yevgeny Grishin also going below Engnestangen’s old mark. But with the Soviet Union absent from Oslo, the title fight would again be between Norway and the United States. A week before the Olympics, an international competition at Hamar saw Norway’s Sigmund Søfteland winning the 500 m, narrowly ahead of defending champion Finn Helgesen and Ken Henry, winner of the US Olympic Trials.
The first Norwegian-American fight took place in the third race between Arne Johansen and Don McDermott. In a close race, the American won by virtue of his fast final metres, beating his opponent 43,9 to 44,0. These times went unbeaten for several pairs, although Hroar Elvenes came close with 44,1. Heat 12 was another close affair, with Gordon Audley (Canada) facing the 1948 Olympic Champion, Helgesen. Both skaters were timed with 44,0, but Audley had a small advantage over the Norwegian, putting him in a tie for second, and Helgesen out of medal contention.
Ken Henry, barely recovered from the flu, clearly distinguished himself from the rest of the field in pair 14. His final time of 43,2 was well ahead of the others, and just a tenth outside Helgesen’s Olympic Record. This time stood until the end of the competition, as favourites Søfteland and Fitzgerald (medalist in 1948) disappointed.
As one of Norway’s top sprinters, Finn Hodt had been selected for the Norwegian 500 m squad. But his selection caused a big commotion in Norway because of Hodt’s past. A member of the Norway’s fascist Nasjonal Samling, he had broken the sports embargo by skating during the German occupation. He had also served on the Eastern front for two years. He was imprisoned for several years as a collaborator, and returned to skating in 1951. But a public outcry after his selection prevented him from competing in the Oslo Games, as the Norwegian Olympic Committee blocked his participation. Hodt would make the team in 1956, and would later become a very successful skating coach.

American Nelson Diebel made it through with 1:01.80, but he was considered only an outside medal contender. His biggest international result as a bronze at the 1991 Pan American Games in the 200 breast, and he had a history in injuries and a wild past.
But Diebel overcame all that. In the final the leaders at the turn were the Unified Team’s Volkov and Vasily Ivanov, with Diebel third, but the Russians faded on the second lap and Diebel came on for a shocking gold medal, with Rózsa hanging on for the silver, the bronze going to Australia’s Philip Rogers.

The surprise winner of the tournament, however, was Leon Rotman of Romania, who took an early lead and never relinquished. He would surprise spectators even further in the C-1 1000 the next day, when he took gold in that event as well. This left Parti and Gennady Bukharin of the Soviet Union to battle for the remaining podium spots, with the former pulling ahead in the concluding stretch to claim silver, while the latter took bronze.

Charles Sands took up golf in 1895 and only three months later went to the final of the first Amateur Championship of the USGA.  There he met the redoubtable Charles Blair MacDonald, and Sands’ lack of experience showed as MacDonald won easily, 12 and 11.  Sands never again played in the U. S. Amateur, and that and his Olympic triumph constitute his entire golfing laurels.
Sands was a well-known athlete, though.  Primarily a tennis player, he was the United States’ champion in 1905 in court tennis, the original form of the game.  He is one of only two American athletes to have competed in the Olympics in three sports – 1900 in golf, 1900 in lawn tennis, and 1908 in jeu de paume (the original name of court tennis).
Al Lambert, the winner of the handicap event, also competed in the Olympic competition, finishing eighth with rounds of 94-95.  Lambert was from St. Louis and when Olympic golf returned to St. Louis in 1904, Lambert would again compete, making him the only person to play in both of the initial Olympic golf tournaments.  In fact, Lambert was the man responsible for the 1904 Olympic golf event.
Lambert was a wealthy man.  He founded Lambert Pharmacal Co., later Warner-Lambert, best-known as the makers of Listerine.  His avocation in later years became flying and he was the primary benefactor for Charles Lindbergh’s trans-atlantic flight.  For his contributions to aviation, the St. Louis airport was named Lambert International Field.
In 1900 Lambert played the Olympic golf event while on a business trip to his Paris office.  On his return he mentioned the Olympic golf event to his father-in-law, Colonel George McGrew.  McGrew was the founder of Glen Echo Golf Club in St. Louis and with the Olympics coming to St. Louis in 1904, Lambert and McGrew put forth plans to conduct an Olympic golf tournament at Glen Echo.

The mark of seven medals at a single Olympics would last until 1980 when Soviet gymnast Aleksandr Dityatin won eight in Moscow.

But on 25 July the IAAF declared that pole to be illegal. The protest against the pole was lodged by the East Germans – Nordwig did not use that pole – based on the fact that it contained carbon fibers. When it was pointed out that the pole did not contain carbon fibers, and that IAAF rules did not specify any material prohibitions on poles, the IAAF banned it anyway because the equipment had not been available to all competitors for the past 12 months. It was also noted to the IAAF that their rules had no such requirement. Then on 27 August, the ban on the poles was lifted and it was announced they would be allowed. However, three days later, the IAAF again reversed itself and reinstated the ban on the poles, confiscating them from the pole vaulters rooms in the Olympic Village. (Obviously, Olympic officials in 1972 were more concerned with what was in the rooms of the Olympic Village than providing security for the place.)
In the competition, Isaksson was severely hampered by the rule change and did not clear a height in qualifying. At 5.30 (17-4½), four vaulters were left in the competition – Nordwig and Reinhard Kuretzky (FRG) clearing that height, while Seagren and Jan Johnson passed to 5.35 (17-6½). Kuretzky went out at 5.35, with Nordwig and Seagren getting first attempt clearances. Johnson went over on his third effort and would do no better, winning the bronze medal. At 5.40 (17-8½), Nordwig cleared on his second attempt and Seagren on his third. But Seagren missed 5.45 (17-10½) while Nordwig won the gold medal at that height, and went on to get over 5.50 (18-0½) as well. Seagren’s world record was 5.63 (18-5½) and he was incensed by how he had been manipulated by the officials. After his last vault, he took the pole he had been forced to vault with and handed it back to IAAF President Adje Paulen.

A convert from inline skating, Derek Parra had been a medal hope for the 1,500 m, but not in this event, having placed 15th at the most recent World Championships. But Parra’s race was excellent, skating with slightly increasing lap times the entire race to beat Romme’s world record. His 6:17.98 only lasted for a few pairs, however.

She then won a world title but an eye injury prematurely ended her career in 2019. Adams had been the oldest Olympic boxing champion for a century so the assumption was that Tokyo would herald in a new generation of flyweights. This was not to be the case.
The first surprise was the absence of previous World Champions Liliya Aetbaeva of Russia, who was not even selected as her country’s representative in the European Qualifying tournament and Choi Mi-Pang of North Korea, whose Olympic hopes were ended by her country’s withdrawal from the Games. This left the Turkish World Championship silver medallist Buse Naz Çakıroğlu, Chang Yuan of China, and Chinese Taipei’s reigning bantamweight world champion Huang Hsiao-Wen as the most likely medallists.
Stoyka Krasteva was a 35-year old Bulgarian who had made to the quarter-finals in 2012 but had missed out on the Rio Olympics. In Tokyo she used all the skill and knowledge she had refined over a decade and a half of international competition. She defeated Yuan in the quarter-final, Japanese fighter Tsukimi Namiki in the semis before comfortably out boxing Çakıroğlu for the gold medal.
In doing so, Krasteva broke Adams’ record as the oldest female Olympic boxing champion by two years and was her country’s first Olympic gold medallist in the sport since 1996.
Mandy Bujold of Canada was a late addition to the field by order of the Court of Arbitration of Sport (CAS). She had taken maternity leave during the first part of the qualifying process but when both the Americas and the final global qualifier were cancelled because of COVID-19, she was left with no opportunity to make Tokyo. CAS ruled that the International Olympic Committee’s boxing task force should have included an accommodation for women who were pregnant or postpartum during the qualifying period. Christine Ongare of Kenya fell pregnant at the age of 12 and was the mother of a 16-year-old son when she competed in Tokyo.

The final was an easy victory for Carr, who took the lead on the first lap and increase her lead throughout, finishing in a world record 1:13.58.

Polyansky was the 1986 World Champion in both backstroke events, but Berkoff had pioneered a new technique. He swam as far as he could underwater after the push-off, often not emerging on top of the water until the 35-40 metre mark. This usually gave him a big lead at the turn, and it was so advantageous that the other swimmers had to adopt the technique, although Berkoff usually still led through the first 40. Berkoff used it in Seoul to break the world record in the preliminaries, recording 54.51.
But in the Seoul final, Berkoff used the technique but only led Japan’s Daichi Suzuki by about a body length at the turn. That was less than expected and it was not enough, as Suzuki came home faster to win the gold medal. Berkoff won silver, barely holding off Polyansky. In fifth place was Canada’s Mark Tewksbury, the 1991 Pan Pacific Champion, who never adapted well to the new underwater technique. He would not need it long. As soon as the Seoul Olympics ended, Berkoff’s underwater start was banned, with the new rule requiring that backstrokers surface and begin stroking on top of the water by 10 metres. This was later changed to 15 metres.

But then on the second slalom run, he straddled a gate and did not finish. The downhill had been led by American Bode Miller, who was having a terrible Olympics, and he continued that trend, not finishing the first slalom run. Behind Raich after the first slalom run were Croatian Ivica Kostelić, and surprising American Ted Ligety, who was a slalom specialist, with three podium finishes in World Cup slaloms in 2005-06, but who had only been named to the US National Team in 2005, and had never placed in a combined event on the World Cup circuit. The final slalom run was won by France’s Jean-Baptiste Grange, who was not a medal contender, having placed only 45th in the downhill and standing 24th going into the second slalom effort. But right behind him was Ligety, which brought him a shocking gold medal. Kostelić was only 12th in the second slalom run but held on for the silver medal, with bronze going to Austrian Rainer Schönfelder.

In Sydney she was partnered with Katrin Wagner.

Great Britain and Japan were also expected to challenge for medals, with Japan not having the best sprinters, but their exchanges were nonpareil.
There were two opening heats, with Jamaica winning heat one, followed by automatic qualifiers Great Britain and Japan, as expected. The United States lined up in heat two, but on the second exchange Fred Kerley was to pass to Ronnie Baker, but the exchange was done so poorly that the USA was left with a huge deficit, and anchor Cravon Gillespie could not recover, as the US finished sixth and was shockingly out of the final. Sprint legend Carl Lewis described it as a “clown show.” Plus ça change, plus c’est la même chose.
The final was thus left with no clear favorite. Japan stunningly dropped the baton on the first exchange and was out. The race came down to a battle between Italy and Great Britain, who were close throughout. On the anchor leg Britain’s Nethaneel Mitchell-Blake led until the final metres when Italy’s Filippo Tortu surged ahead to give the Italians the gold, as Great Britain took silver.

Martinenghi was slow at the beginning, turning only in fifth place, behind American Michael Andrew and Belarussian Ilia Shymanovich, but he finished the quickest of the three to take the bronze.
Peaty’s gold made him only the second Olympian to defend the men’s 100 breaststroke, after Japan’s Kosuke Kitajima in 2004-08. Martinenghi’s bronze was only the second medal for Italy in the event, after Domenico Fioravanti’s gold back in 2000 at Sydney. Three days after this final Kamminga would win another silver in the 200 breaststroke.

There was the 2014 World Champion and 2015 silver medallist Oleh Verniaiev of Ukraine, the only man to qualify for as many as four individual finals in Rio, and he was the highest scoring qualifier for the parallel bars final. There was also the 2015 World Champion You Hao of China and his team-mate Deng Shudi, who was the bronze medallist in 2015. The silver and bronze medallists from the 2014 Worlds, Danell Leyva of the USA and Ryohei Kato of Japan, made up the strong line-up. The 2013 World Champion Lin Chaopan of China missed out on qualification despite finishing sixth, but he was not eligible for the final as he was the third best placed Chinese gymnast and only two per country were eligible for the final.
The American Leyva set the pace with an opening 15.900. The Chinese gymnasts were up third and fourth and both chose the two toughest routines. You Hao’s had a difficulty of 7.400, but a fall backwards on landing was costly and his 14.833 put him into last place, although Deng’s 15.766 off a difficulty of 7.200 put him into second place. He was soon relegated to third after Russia’s David Belyavsky’s routine scored him 15.783. The positions changed again when Verniaiev scored a massive 16.041, the best of the day, and that is how it remained as the last two, Cuba’s Manrique Larduet and Japan’s Kato, did nothing to change the medal order. Verniaiev won Ukraine’s first gold of the Games and added to the silver he won in the all-round individual competition. The silver medal for Leyva was a sweet one because he was originally a reserve on the US team, despite being the only American male to win a medal in 2012, but injury to John Orozco’s ankle in training led to Leyva being called into the team.

In the final, however, Zenz found herself battling Yelizaveta Dementyeva of the Soviet Union for gold and lost the fight, settling for silver instead.

The Pole defeated the two Frenchmen, both by 5-4 and then also beat Losert convincingly to become the first Olympic fencing champion from Poland. Magnan defeated Revenu to claim silver.

In the press, Hungary’s Imre Földi took the lead over Vakhonin, 115.0 to 110.0 kg. Földi continued to lead after the snatch but Vakhonin moved up 2.5 kg. Vakhonin was able to win the gold medal with a lift that should have been a world record in the clean & jerk (142.5 kg), but by then he was overweight for the class so it counted only as an Olympic record. This gave him a world record total of 357.5 and the gold medal, with Földi taking silver.
Vakhonin went on to win multiple international titles but never competed again at the Olympics, as he was removed from the Soviet team prior to the 1968 Olympics for “conduct unbecoming a Master of Sport.” Imre Földi had one of the great careers of any weightlifter in the 1960s. He competed at five Olympics (1960-76), winning silver medals in this class in 1964-68 and a gold medal in 1972, and won the 1965 World Championship and four European Championships (1963, 1968, 1970-71). At the end of the 20th century, he was voted the second greatest weightlifter of all-time in several polls, trailing Turkey’s Naim Suleymanoğlu.

Brazil’s Erlon Silva and Isaquias Queiroz were the reigning World and Pan-American Champions, with the latter having become the first Brazilian to win a canoeing medal by taking silver in the C-1 1000 and bronze in the C-1 200, and would certainly benefit from a home crowd. Russia had been successful at the Europeans, winning in 2013 and 2016 and coming in as runner-up in-between, and brought rookie Ilya Shtokalov to Rio to support the decorated Ilya Pervukhin, who had earned a bronze medal in the event at the 2012 Summer Olympics. This was a result of Pervukhin’s normal partner, Aleksey Korovashkov, being among the over 100 Russians banned from Rio due to doping concerns.
Germany won its preliminary heat, qualifying automatically for the final, while Russia finished third behind Brazil and Ukraine’s Dmytro Yanchuk and Taras Mishchuk, the 2015 European Champions. Ukraine advanced by winning its semifinal heat, while Russia was again third, this time in a semifinal won by Fernando Jorge and Serguey Torres of Cuba. In the final, Brazil led for most of the distance, fueled by the support of a home crowd, but was passed in the last stretch by the Germans, giving Brendel his second gold medal of the Games.

More than a few spectators were hopeful that they would make the podium.
East Germany had the fastest time in the opening round, but was not completely dominant, as the Swiss duo of Fredy Bachmann and Heini Fischer, a lesser-known pair, won its heat in a time less than 0.16 seconds shy of the East Germans. The other two heats were won by crews from West Germany and the Soviet Union, both of whom were eliminated in the semi-finals.

He was given a two-year suspension. He appealed this and in December 1991 The Athletics Congress (TAC) supported his appeal, asking that his suspension be lifted. This was denied by an IAAF panel and Reynolds appeared to be out of the Olympics. But then a federal judge ruled that Reynolds should be allowed to compete so he could qualify for the Olympic Trials, and should be allowed to compete in the Trials, if he qualified. The reasoning was that Reynolds’ suspension would be lifted just before the Barcelona Olympics but he first had to qualify. Then the IAAF ruled that any athletes running against Reynolds would be subject to suspension from competition. Legal shenanigans went back and forth and eventually the Olympic Trials 400 heats were postponed a few days while it was sorted out. Finally, Reynolds got to run in the Trials in New Orleans, but in a bit of an anti-climax, did not make the Olympic team.
In his absence the favorites were still the American threesome of defending gold medalist Steve Lewis, the 1988 bronze medalist Danny Joe Everett, and Quincy Watts. Everett went out in the semi-finals in Seoul, with a leg injury. Another athlete to be injured in the semis was Britain’s Derek Redmond, who hobbled and fell to the track. Suddenly a man appeared from the stands and helped him to his feet – it was his father. With his arm around his father, he limped the remaining 200 metres to the finish line, supported by his Dad, who told him, “We started your career together, so let’s finish this race together.” It was one of the more emotional moments in Olympic history and is still replayed often.
After all that drama, the final of the 400 metres seemed almost an afterthought. Watts and Lewis started fastest together and Watts pulled away by 200 metres. He powered thru the final curve and held on for a huge victory margin of almost seven metres over Lewis. Kenya’s Samson Kitur, 1990 Commonwealth Games silver medalist, finished quickly to get third.

The final was no contest, with the United States winning their sixth consecutive Olympic gold medal, 101-72, over Spain. The strength of the American team can be seen by the fact that the 2015 WNBA MVP, Elena Delle Donne, usually came off the bench. Among the US players, Diana Taurasi, Sue Bird, and Tamika Catchings won their fourth Olympic gold medals, equaling the mark held by former US players Teresa Edwards and Lisa Leslie.

As the three-time World Champion, world record holder and current World Cup leader, Kramer was the overwhelming favorite for this event.
Kramer was the first of the top skaters to race. On the tough Richmond ice, he narrowly beat the Olympic record dating from 2002, setting 6:14.60. As Kramer had predicted a winning time of 6:11, he was uncertain about this performance getting off the ice. The next race saw team mate Bob de Jong take the stage against Lee Seung-Hun of South Korea. The 2006 champion in the 10,000 m, De Jong was expected to fight for the medals, but instead he was soundly beaten by Lee.

It had given Skobrev his first international medals, while Fabris had won an impressive World Cup victory earlier in the season. Both skaters were ahead of Lee’s splits for most of the race, but had to pay for their fast starts in the end. Skobrev less so than Fabris, finishing in 6:18.05. This meant a bronze medal, as the runner-up of the 2009 Worlds, Håvard Bøkko (Norway) was off-pace for the entire race and placed fourth.

At Rio, it consisted of six endurance events over two days, now it was just four events over one gruelling day. Laura Kenny was aiming to win her third consecutive Olympic omnium in the last track event of the 2020 Games. She was also hoping to add to her total of five gold medals, and was inspired after seeing husband Jason win his seventh gold a short while earlier.
Standing in Kenny’s way were some extremely good cyclists in this four-discipline event. Kirsten Wild was seen as the biggest threat to Kenny’s domination. The Dutch rider was the 2019 omnium world champion, as well as winning the madison world title that year, and again in 2020. The 2019 and 2020 World Championships silver medallist Letizia Paternoster of Italy was another rider in with a chance, as was Jennifer Valente, a member of the USA pursuit team that won Olympic bronze just a few days earlier. The home crowd had their own favourite in the reigning world champion Yumi Kajihara.
Kenny’s chance of retaining her title was severely disrupted when she was sent hurtling to the track in a multi-rider pile up on the penultimate lap of the opening scratch race. She did not finish the race and was one of nine riders each awarded 16 points, but America’s Valente got the maximum 40 points with Kajihara taking second on 38, and Wild finishing third for 36 points. Kenny came back to take maximum points in the new tempo race but still trailed Valente by 20 points. France’s Clara Copponi took maximum points from the elimination race while Kenny only scored 13 in what was regarded as her best element. Going into the final race, the points race, Valente led by just two points from Kajihara with Norway’s Anita Stenberg a further 14 points behind.
Despite being the top scorer in the points race with 24, it was too much ground for Laura Kenny to make up and she finished sixth. Valente survived a crash in the latter part of the points race, but her 14 points in the last race gave her a total of 124, which was good enough to take gold. Kajihara could not capitalise and scored just two points to finish four points behind Valente. Kirsten Wild scored well and got to within two points of the local favourite to take the bronze medal.
Jennifer Valente won a third consecutive omnium medal for the USA, but it was their first gold after Sarah Hammer’s bronzes in 2012 and 2016. It was also America’s first track cycling gold of the Tokyo Games and their first Olympic gold on the track since Marty Nothstein won the individual sprint at Sydney in 2000.

Latynina would win six medals in Melbourne, including four golds, missing out only on the balance beam where she finished fourth. While a career for most gymnasts, Latynina would return and win six medals again in 1960 at Rome and 1964 at Tokyo, ending her career with 18 Olympic medals, an absolute Olympic record that lasted until Michael Phelps surpassed her at London in 2012, where he finished with 22 medals.
Muratova was the wife of Valentin Muratov, who also starred in Melbourne on the Soviet men’s team. She would competed again in Rome and end her Olympic career with eight medals and two golds. Keleti’s career had a different ending. She had competed at the 1952 Olympics, but after the Hungarian November Revolution of 1956, she defected while in Melbourne, and eventually settled in Israel, where she coached the national women’s team.

Team/individual competitions held concurrently.",na,"This event led to one of the great controversies of the London Olympics. Sweden seemingly won the gold medal by almost 100 points. Olympic equestrian dressage eligibility rules in 1948 required that all competitors be military officers, but after the Games it was discovered that one Swedish team member, Gehnäll Persson, had been promoted from non-commissioned officer to second lieutenant only for the duration of the Olympic Games to allow him to compete. France’s Georges Hector, secretary-general of the Fédération Équestre Internationale (FEI), found this out shortly after the Olympics and it was reported to the IOC Session in April 1949. The IOC deferred the matter back to the FEI, who decided to disqualify Persson. The Swedish Olympic Committee reported in December 1949 that they had returned the medals and diplomas won by the Swedish riders.
The irony was that in November 1949, at the FEI Congress, they relaxed the rules for future Olympic Games, allowing civilians, non-commissioned officers, and even women (in some disciplines, including dressage), to compete.
The Swedish team consisted of Persson, Gustaf Adolf Boltenstern, Jr., and Henri Saint Cyr. As a team, they would return in 1952 and win the gold medal, after the eligibility rules were relaxed, and they would win again in 1956 at Melbourne. Thus, save for the disqualification in 1948, this same threesome would have won the team dressage gold medal at three consecutive Olympics.
After the Swedish disqualification, France was promoted to the gold medal, with the United States’ team receiving the silver medals. Bronze went to Portugal, which remains, through 2012, the only medal won by Portugal in Olympic dressage. There were only five teams entered in the competition, with Argentina placing fourth after the Swedish DQ.

She held the world record in both events, and had won them both at the 1991 World and European Championships, and already had a gold medal in Barcelona, in the 400 IM.
If there was any doubt Egerszegi erased it in qualifying, leading American Lea Loveless by almost four full seconds. The final was a bit closer, but not much, as she won by 2.4 seconds over Germany’s Dagmar Hase, who three days earlier had won a surprising gold medal in the 400 freestyle over Janet Evans.

Ten out of 12 teams were at the very top of the ratings of the International Volleyball Federation, but the very strong teams of Serbia and Slovenia did not get to the Olympics. Tunisia (19th) and Venezuela (48th place) played instead, as it was necessary to ensure the principle that each continent would have a participant in the tournament. The last two World Championships were won by the team of Poland, and second place was taken by Brazil. These two teams were the favorites at the Tokyo Olympic Games.
In the first round, the Polish team surprisingly lost to Iran with a score of 2-3 but, despite this, Poland took first place in Group A and justified their status as the favorite. As a result, the teams of Iran and Venezuela were rather predictably eliminated from this group. In group B, quite unexpectedly, first place was taken by the team of the Russian Olympic Committee, with second place captured by Brazil. In the penultimate round of the preliminary round, the ROC team lost to the French team and allowed them to take fourth place. The US team, which performed very poorly at this stage of the competition, sensationally failed to progress to the quarterfinals along with Tunisia. The Americans, who qualified for Tokyo whilst ranked second in the world, only finished fifth in their group.
The next stage of the competition confirmed the strength of Group B, as none of the teams from Group A made it to the semifinals. Thus, the big four of Argentina, Brazil, France and the Russian Olympic Committee were formed. In this final quartet, the Brazilian team, the champion of the Olympic Games in Rio, was considered the favorite, the team having won medals during the last four Olympics.  But then came a sensation: first Brazil lost to ROC and then, in the match for the bronze medal, to Argentina. For the first time in the last five Olympics, a strong Brazilian team left empty-handed.
The surprises only continued. The title was taken by the French team, which defeated the ROC national team in a very closely contested match that was decided by a tie-break set. France had taken part in the Olympic Games on five occasions without rising above the eighth place. Third place was taken by the Argentine team. This was only the second medal success of this country at the Olympic Games, after winning a bronze medal at the 1988 Seoul Olympics.

In over a decade, she had claimed 9 consecutive World Championships in the event, as well as the 2010 and 2014 Olympic titles (and a 4th place in 2006), and 11 consecutive long distance World Cups. She also bettered the world record twice, lowering it to 6:42.66 in 2011. But in the 2017/2018, Sáblíková had struggled with her form, following a pre-season injury. In the event’s only appearance at the World Cup, in Stavanger, she did place third, with victory going to Claudia Pechstein. Although a 3-time Olympic champion in the event, Pechstein hadn’t won a race internationally in three years and was 45 at the time. In 2017, though, she had finished second at the World Championships (behind Sáblíková). Third place there went to Canada’s Ivanie Blondin, who also came second in Stavanger.
The contest opened with Annouk van der Weijden of Netherlands with a sub-7 minute race, with 6:54.17, a personal best about 2 seconds slower than Sáblíková’s track record. It held up through the first half of the field. She was first challenged by her compatriot, Esmee Visser. A surprise qualifier at the Dutch trials, she had won the inaugural European 3,000 m title earlier in the year. Visser trailed Van der Weijden’s time until halfway, then pulled away to a strong finish at 6:50.23, the fastest time at the Olympics since the high-altitude competition in Salt Lake City 2002. Both Pechstein and Blondin attempted to follow along with Visser’s splits, but lost touch after 2,600 m and faded to non-medal finishes. The final pair seemed to follow a similar pattern: Sáblíková and Nataliya Voronina had the same split as Visser at 2,200 m, but then failed to keep up. However, Sáblíková managed to limit damage, and kept within two seconds, crossing the line in 6:51.85. Behind her Voronina also hung on, beating Van der Weijden to the bronze by a few tenths. Visser, who had never raced an international 5,000 m event at senior level, was shocked and ecstatic at her victory - the first by a Dutch skater in the event since 1988. Sáblíková’s second place made her the second Olympian for Czech Republic to win six medals, tying Kateřina Neumannová.

Rouse started fastest and led at the turn but Tewksbury came back strong, and won gold by a hand touch, 0.06 seconds. Rouse knew his win was an upset, stating, “Realistically, on paper, I shouldn’t have been there.” Rouse would come back a few days later and break his world record on the opening leg of the medley relay final.

A former Pan-American Games champion and two time world medallist, he had been to the Games of Beijing and London but lost his first bout on both occasions to a boxer fighting in front of his home crowd.
2016 meant that Conceição was now the home fighter and he took full advantage. After defeating a pair of Central Asian fighters in his first two bouts he survived a torrid encounter with Cuba’s Lázaro Álvarez to reach the Olympic final. His opponent would be Sofiane Oumiha of France.
Drawing inspiration from a rowdy home crowd, the Brazilian won the first two rounds of the contest with an elusive style of defence mixed with  aggressive counter attacks. The Frenchman was more successful in the final round but it was too late and Conceição became the first ever Olympic boxing champion from Brazil.
Conceição was born in a poor neighbourhood in the city of Salvador and helped out on his family’s vegetable stall before becoming a boxer. He married fellow Olympic boxer Erica Matos in 2013 and their two-year-old daughter was present at the venue when he won his title.
Although he lost his bout in the round of sixteen, Thailand’s Amnat Ruenroeng made history in Rio.

The marginal favourite was Swedish rider Rolf-Göran Bengtsson, the European champion who also headed the world rankings, with the Swiss pair of Pius Schwizer and Steve Guerdat along with the veteran British rider Nick Skelton also being thought of as potential medallists. Bengtsson’s hopes were to be dashed on the morning of the final when he was forced to withdraw when his horse pulled up lame.
With four rider-horse teams clear over the fences in the two rounds of jumping, the medals were decided by time penalties. Guerdat became the first Swiss rider to win the title since 1924 by producing the only two rounds both clear and inside the time limit. In a jump-off between those with only a single time penalty each Gerco Schröder of the Netherlands capitalized on a mistake by Irishman Cian O’Connor to win the silver. Saudi rider Kamal Bahamdan was fourth despite not having made a jumping mistake – his two time penalties robbed him of a medal.
Schröder had little time to celebrate his Olympic medals as his horse, aptly named London, was seized from him as part of bankruptcy proceedings against the horse’s previous owners.
O’Connor had a strange journey towards his Olympic medal. After seemingly winning the gold medal at the Athens Olympics his title was stripped when his horse tested positive for an anti-psychotic drug. He was initially left out of the Irish team for London but when Denis Lynch’s horse Lantinus was excluded from a competition in Aachen for hypersensitivity in its’ legs, O’Connor was called up in his place and he survived an appeal from Lynch to the Court of Arbitration in Sport to reach London. His chances then appeared gone when he missed qualification for the final round but Bengtsson’s exit gave him a reprieve.
At 65 years of age Ian Millar produced another top 10 finish in his 10th Olympic Games. He became the first person to reach double figures in Olympic appearances, having first appeared in 1972 and only missing 11 appearances because of the 1980 Olympic boycott by Canada.

Ivanov had won the last two editions of the European Championships, come in third in 1957 and 1958, and had been runner-up in the Diamond Challenge Sculls at the Henley Royal Regatta in the same years. He was aided in the fact that his most significant challenger, Australia’s Stuart MacKenzie, got sick prior to the race and did not compete. By 1960 MacKenzie was on his fourth of six consecutive victories at the Diamond Challenge Sculls, the reigning British Empire and Commonwealth Games champion, a two-time European Champion (1957 and 1958), and an Olympic silver medalist (1956). Another potential threat was Teodor Kocerka of Poland, who had a bronze medal in the event from the 1952 Summer Olympics in addition to numerous victories and podium finishes at the European Championships and the Diamond Challenge Sculls. The only other European Championship medalist from the past four years was Germany’s Klaus von Fersen, who had been runner-up four consecutive times, but he did not compete in Rome.

Her main rivals were expected to be Marta Walczkiewicz of Poland, silver medallist at the Rio Olympics and regular medallist at the World Championships, and Emma Jørgensen of Denmark, the 2018 World Championship silver medallist. All the favourites easily qualified first into the semis and then next day into the A Final.
In the A Final, Carrington confidently took the lead and finished breaking her own Olympic best time, which she just set a few hours earlier in the semi-final. Spain’s Teresa Portela won the silver medal and Jørgensen finished third. Portela became the first Spanish female athlete in history to compete at six Olympic Games, since her début at Sydney in 2000.

The tiebreaker for the Short Program was the Required Elements score, while the tiebreaker for the Free Skating was the Artistic Impression score.  Thus, if a skater was ranked first by a majority of the judges, that skater was placed first overall for that section.  Ties were broken by a Subsequent Majority rule, i.e., if the skaters were ranked for the same position by the same number of judges, Majority Placement for the next higher position for each skater determined who was ranked higher.  Final placement was determined by factored placements.  The tiebreakers were then 1) Number of Majority Placements, 2) Total Ordinals of Majority, 3) Total Ordinals.  The placement for the Compulsory Figures was factored by 0.6 (30%), the placement for the short program was factored by 0.4 (20%), and the placement for Free Skating was factored by 1.0 (50%).  The sums of the factored placements were then used to determine final placement, with the Free Skating being the tiebreaker.",na,"The last two World Champions had been Elaine Zayak (USA-1982) and Rosalyn Sumners (USA-1983), and they were in Sarajevo, looking for gold. Zayak lost her chance in the compulsories when she placed 13th. Sumners won the compulsories over West Germany’s Claudia Leistner, with East German Katarina Witt, who hadplaced second to Zayak at the 1982 Worlds, third. Witt, who had been 1983 and 1984 European Champion, then won the short program, while Sumners placed only fifth, falling to second overall. The gold medal would come down to whichever of them could win the free skate. The free skate was very close. Sumners looked to have the better of it for most of her routine. But near the end she doubled a planned triple toe loop and singled a double axel. Witt was voted first in the free skate by five judges to four for Sumners, giving Witt the gold medal. Witt would return in 1988 to win a second gold medal. Her beauty and skating artistry and athleticism would eventually make her a very wealthy woman. She was the first East German athlete who was allowed to skate professionally and after the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1991, she made millions.

Previously it had been 2 x 6 km for the women and 2 x 7.5 km for the men. Gusty winds made the first event in biathlon at the 2022 Winter Games a turbulent affair. Nevertheless, the favourites eventually collected their medals with Norway winning gold ahead of France and the ROC in third.
The first team that fell victim to the conditions was Germany with rookie Vanessa Voigt. Although known as an excellent shooter, she started with two penalty rounds. Norway, with Marte Olsbu Røiseland, held the lead at the first exchange. Italy’s Dorothea Wierer was the best markswoman of the top teams on the second leg, finishing second in the second exchange behind France’s Julia Simon. This time, Norway’s Tiril Eckhoff went three penalty rounds and dropped back to fifth place.
The weather conditions improved when the men took over. Émilien Jacquelin had a brilliant start with a clean first round of shooting. At the standing shooting, however, it was his turn to suffer two extra penalty rounds. Aleksandr Loginov’s third leg brought the ROC from seventh to first at the last exchange, followed by Sweden, with France third. The United States were a surprise fourth, with Norway in fifth, but still only 21.9 seconds behind the leaders.
Eventually the skiing speed of Johannes Thingnes Bø and Quentin Fillon Maillet would decide the race. They closed in on ROC’s Eduard Latypov. A three-way battle ensued on the final lap, in which the Norwegians had the upper hand, with only 1.5 seconds separating the three top teams.
For Norway this was their third consecutive medal in the mixed relay, in what was the third edition of this event, having won gold in 2014, and silver in 2018. Tiril Eckhoff became the first biathlete to win three medals in the mixed relay, as she had been on each of those three teams.

Gong would finish with three fouls, while Adams fouled in rounds four and five. Carter improved in round four to 19.87, but remained in second place, and again had a good mark in round five. In round six, Carter produced a PR effort of 20.63, bettering her previous best by almost one foot (30 cm), and stunningly moved ahead of Adams with only one throw remaining. Adams produced a good effort, 20.39, to try to catch Carter, but would only take silver. Carter had won the first shot put gold medal by an American woman. In the final round, Hungarian Anita Márton threw 19.87 to push Gong off the podium and win bronze.

Cooper’s Australian teammate, Alisa Camplin, was a former gymnast with great ability on her jumps, but was noted to be a rather mediocre skier for this level of competition. She placed second in the qualifying round behind Switzerland’s Evelyne Leu, who set a world best with her qualifying total of 203.16.

On the first jump of the final, the leader was Olga Koroleva (RUS) followed by Belarussian Alla Tsuper, with Camplin in third.

The World Champion had to struggle hard to beat Yeroshina with a scant five second margin. From one of the latest starting numbers, the 25-year-old Swede Sonja Edström was able to split the leading Soviet trio and secured a surprising bronze medal, only 12 seconds behind the Olympic Champion Kozyreva.

There were three other major contenders – the super-G gold medalist Kjetil André Aamodt (NOR), the 1991-92 World Cup leader Paul Accola (SUI), and the peripatetic Marc Girardelli (LUX). Girardelli had been a four-time overall World Cup champion, and coming into Albertville was considered the greatest skier without an Olympic medal, although he had ended that in the super-G with a silver. Girardelli was born in Austria and lived mostly in Switzerland. He had acquired Luxembourgeois citizenship after he and his father had disputes with the Austrian ski team. He had been unable to compete at the 1984 Winter Olympics because he did not obtain his citizenship in time, and although he competed at Calgary in 1988, he struggled there.
There were 131 skiers in the event, the largest entry ever in Winter Olympic skiing, and the first run seemingly took forever to complete. To make it more time-consuming, the course was not that difficult and a full 109 skiiers finished and competed in the second run. The first run went according to form, with Tomba leading, following by Girardelli, Aamodt, and Accola. Tomba again posted the fastest time in the second run, to defend his gold medal, with the order unchanged – Girardelli getting his second silver in Albertville, Aamodt winning bronze, and Accola in fourth place. Tomba’s performance made him the first Alpine skier to defend a title at the Winter Olympics.
Near the end of the race, Raymond Keyrouz was the 129th starter. But he was so slow that he was passed by the 130th starter El-Hassan Mahta. Both were eventually disqualified for missing gates.

The defending Olympic champion also won three of the last four World Championships (2011, 2013, 2015) and a bronze medal in 2014, and was considered by some to be the best freestyle wrestler in the world.
But in an unimaginable upset, Burroughs was beaten 3-2 in his match against world-ranked number two, Russia’s Aniuar Geduyev – a match worthy of a final, and then hours later lost an unthinkable 11-1 in his next match to Bekzod Abdurakhmonov of Uzbekistan. Burroughs had lost twice in one day after losing twice, period, in his international career, and was off the Olympic podium. He wept in his wife’s arms.
In the 74 kg final, which saw several medical timeouts, the World bronze medalist Geduyev dominated the first period to take a 6-0 lead over the 21-year-old Iranian Hassan Yazdani, who entered the 2016 Rio Olympics having already been crowned 2014 World Junior champion and 2015 World Championship 70 kg silver medalist.  Yazdani was able to take advantage of the fact that Geduyev was bleeding profusely from his forehead and not able to make the moves he normally might have been able to. Coming through with three takedowns in the last period, the final one coming with eight seconds on the clock, Yazdani won the gold medal in dramatic fashion.
European champion Soner Demirtaş of Turkey blanked Galymzhan Userbayev from Kazakhstan 6-0 in the first bronze-medal match, earning his first world-level medal, while Azerbaijan’s Cəbrayıl Həsənov bounced back from his semi-final loss, beating Abdurakhmonov 9-7 for the other bronze.

Although Chapuis had taken silver at the 2015 World Championships, and had a few recent World Cup victories, neither he nor his compatriot were the favorites for the event in 2018. That distinction went to Marc Bischofberger of Switzerland, who was first in the World Cup rankings at the time of the Games. Sweden’s Victor Öhling Norberg, the reigning World Champion, was also a contender, while the 2015 edition of that tournament was won by Slovenia’s Filip Flisar.
Each round of the ski cross was divided into heats of four competitors, with the top two advancing. The course in PyeongChang was particularly brutal and, due to the number of athletes who crashed during training, was modified shortly prior to the final in order to make it safer. The changes were not enough for Canadian Christopher Del Bosco, a three-time Olympian and multiple medalist at the Winter X Games, whose crash was so bad that the quarterfinals were delayed while medical professionals checked up on him and then removed him from the course. Still, with the exception of the eliminated Norberg, the rest of the skiers pressed on. Chapuis came last in his heat during the quarterfinals, while Flisar and Bovolenta dropped out in the semifinals. This left Bischofberger facing Russia’s Sergey Ridzik and two Canadians, Brady Leman and Kevin Drury.
Of the three, Leman was the most distinguished, having been the 2016 Winter X Games Champion. He had also been the fourth skier in the final at the 2014 Olympics, but had crashed during his run, paving the way for the French medal sweep. His luck four years later, however, was much better, as he managed to beat the favored Bischofberger down the course and capture the gold medal, leaving the Swiss competitor with silver. Ridzik and Drury, on the other hand, crashed into one another, and while Drury’s ski came off, disqualifying him, Ridzik held on to his equipment, got up, and made it down the hill to claim the final podium spot.

Since then the Germans (East Germany in 1988) had taken the gold medal every time but once, losing it to Hungary in 1992. In the World Championships, Hungary earned the title nine times and Germany or East Germany 12 times since its Olympic début, with Hungary being the most recent; the last time another nation had been a World Champion was Bulgaria in 1977. Thus, without a doubt, Germany and Hungary were the favorites for gold and silver in 2012. The bronze medalist at the 2011 World Championships was Belarus, but the race for the third podium spot was far more open than that for either of the others.
In the opening round Germany and Hungary won their respective heats, but Hungary did so in a time that was slower than every team in the Germans’ heat, except for Poland. Portugal, as the next fastest team, qualified directly to the final alongside the two favorites for the race. In the semi-finals Poland posted a world record to win the round and qualify for the finals alongside Belarus, Russia, Great Britain, and France. The final came down to a mad dash between the Germany and Hungary, but the Hungarians defeated their rivals handily, denying them a fifth consecutive gold medal in the event.

But Didier Défago and Bode Miller were also highly considered after winning gold and bronze in the downhill four days earlier.

For the first time, the Americans entered an all-star team.  The Soviet Union did not enter the 1952 Winter Olympics, but would first appear at the Olympics later in the year in the Summer Olympics.  The top teams in Oslo were Canada, the United States, Sweden, and Czechoslovakia.  They lost only to each other.  Canada and the United States tied, 3-3, but Canada did not lose a game, and won the gold medal, as the Americans had lost to Sweden, 4-2.
Sweden and Czechoslovakia had identical records of 6-2, and played a tie-breaking game for the bronze medal, Sweden winning 5-3, and also being declared European Champions as a result of that match. Czechoslovakia did not want to play the match, as they had plans to leave Oslo at 1000 that morning, and had a long discussion with the jury before they agreed to stay and play the game.

They had swim earlier in the night in the 200 free with Agnel winning and Lochte placing fourth. Lochte was definitely stronger but not well-known as a sprinter and the question was if he could hold off Agnel.
The answer was no. Agnel closed quickly and won gold for France in 3:09.93, with Lochte coming home in 3:10.38 for the silver medal.

Outsider Jorrit Bergsma, the 2020 world champion, was also a former Dutch champion in marathon skating.
The main surprise of the semi-finals was the elimination of Zakharov. The 2014 Olympic short track champion suffered a fall and was unable to qualify. The final was dominated by Swings. He personally quashed all run-away attempts. With two laps to go, Bergsma sped up for a long sprint, but most of the pack was able to follow. At the bell, Swings took the lead, only to be quickly overtaken by Lee. The Korean still headed the field as Swings passed him on the outside.

Swings crossed the line for the first Belgian gold medal at the Olympic Winter Games since 1948, when Micheline Lannoy and Pierre Baugniet won the figure skating pairs event. Only 0.07 seconds behind him, Jeong emerged second based on the photo finish.

It was the first, and until 2016, the only Olympic marathon that neither started, nor finished at the Olympic stadium. The race started in the late afternoon and finished in the dark, the course lit by torches to illuminate the route. And it was won by a man running barefooted.
The race started at 5:30 PM at the Piazza di Campidoglio, one of Roma’s seven hills. The course was a triangular loop, running along many of the wonders of Ancient Roma. The course passed along the Caracalla Baths, ran down the Appian Way, and finished under the Arch of Constantine, in the dark.
The favorite was probably the Soviet runner, Sergey Popov, who on 11 October 1959, at the Košice Marathon in Czechoslovakia, had become the second runner under 2-20, breaking the world record with 2-17:45.2. The early lead was taken by the Belgian Aurèle Vandendriessche, who had won five Belgian titles since 1956. He was joined by a small group that included Britain’s Arthur Keily, and two African runners, Ethiopia’s Abebe Bikila and the Moroccan, Rhadi Ben Abdesselam. Bikila was unusual as he was running the race barefoot. By 20 km. Bikila and Rhadi had taken the lead, and they would run together until near the stadium. At about 500 metres from the finish, at the Piazza di Porta Capena, running down the torchlit way, Bikila finally broke Rhadi and pulled away to win the race by 25 seconds. It was ironic that Bikila made his move as he passed the Obelisco di Azum, which had been brought to the square from Ethiopia after the Italian invasion of that nation by Mussolini. The bronze medal was won by New Zealand’s Barry Magee, with two Soviet runners following – Konstantin Vorobyov in 4th and Popov in 5th.
Bikila would return to run the Olympic marathon again in 1964, winning in world record time. By then he would be acclaimed as the greatest marathoner ever, and many experts still give him that title. In his career, he ran 15 marathons between 1959-68, winning 12 of the first 13, but not finishing his last two, which included his final race at the 1968 Olympics. He would later be severely injured in a car crash, and rendered quadriparetic, dying in the early 1970s.

He was helped by his hydration plan. Though the US was in the midst of prohibition and alcoholic beverages were outlawed, Noël convinced US officials that wine was an essential part of his diet. He snuck into the tunnel of the stadium to drink in between rounds. On his big fourth round throw, his discus landed out beyond Anderson’s leading 49.39 (162-0½) mark.

In the final Dressel led off for the Americans, putting them into the lead, 0.26 seconds ahead of France and Maxime Grousset. Blake Pieroni and Bowe Becker maintained the lead for the Americans as they led at every exchange. The anchor leg was swum by Zach Apple, who came home in 46.69, the second fastest leg of the relay, to secure gold for the USA.
Italy, which had been fourth in the early going, came on strong on the last two legs, swum by Lorenzo Zazzeri and Manuel Frigo, to win silver, just ahead of Australia. The Aussies had not been in medal contention for the first two legs, but Kyle Chalmers’ anchor of 46.44 was the fastest split in the event and brought them the bronze medal.

The eight heats were all won in modest times but in the final Sheppard posted a new world record of 1:52.8.  It is, however, probable that Kilpatrick had passed the 800 metres mark in a slightly faster time when he set his world record.  In anticipation of a fast Olympic final, a tape was also placed at 880 yards which Sheppard reached in 1:54.0.  After 400 metre splits of 53.0 and 59.8, it is evident that Sheppard was slowing considerably towards the end of the race but even so, a differential of 1.2 seconds to cover the additional 4.68 metres between 800 metres and 880 yards seems unrealistic.  Having won the 1,500 metres seven days earlier, Sheppard completed a notable middle distance double.
Melvin Sheppard would eventually win four gold medals in middle distance running at the Olympics.  In 1908 he won the 800, 1,500, and ran on the medley relay team, anchoring the 800 metre leg.  In 1912, he also ran on the 4 x 400 metre relay.  He eventually won five AAU titles over two laps - 1906-08, and 1911-12, and three Canadian titles - 1906, 1911-12.

However she was then blessed by a piece of good luck when the Nigerian Olympic Committee announced that it would not be taking up the qualifying position earned by its top female fencer. Suddenly Zagunis was back in contention.
Ranked only at #3 of the three woman US team,  Zagunis was a revelation as the tournament progressed and, as more experienced fencers were defeated, she continued to win and found herself facing former World Champion Tan Xue of China for the Olympic championship. The American youngster galloped into an 8-2 lead and, while the Chinese fencer fought back to close the margin to just three points at one stage, Zagunis rallied to record a comfortable victory by 15-9.
Americans fencers had first competed at the Olympic Games in 1900 but only Albertson Van Zo Post had previously clinched Olympic gold and he had done it in the long abandoned  discipline of single sticks and against a field entirely populated by Americans.
The US team had more to cheer as Zagunis’ compatriot Sada Jacobson won the bronze. Zagunis and Jacobson would return to the Olympics in 2008 and face off against each other in the Olympic final as the US made a rare sweep of the medals.

Deneen’s crash into the gates on the landing hill and Ronkainen’s lackluster run left the top four qualifiers (which included Bryon Wilson of the United States) as the most likely podium finishers. An impressive run by Begg-Smith left him at the front of the pack, and Wilson came in right behind him, assuring the Australian a medal. Bilodeau followed next and did not disappoint his compatriots, edging out Begg-Smith’s time by 0.55 seconds, the determining factor in his being ranked in the gold medal position. When Colas completed the event with a sixth-place run, Bilodeau became the first Canadian to win an Olympic gold medal on his home turf.

The class was now for lifters over 109 kg bodyweight, the second highest in Olympic history after the 110 kg contested from 1972-92. Going into the final event of the Games, European lifters had not won a gold medal, which was the same scenario as Rio 2016.
As in Rio, it was down to the strongest men to change this, and once again that responsibility fell on the shoulders of the Georgian Lasha Talakhadze. In Rio he had support as the Europeans enjoyed a clean sweep of the medals but this time he was almost alone. Nevertheless, he was one of the safest gold medal bets of the Games. Talakhadze was unbeaten since Rio, and won three world and four European titles, and was also the world record holder with 264 kg in clean & jerk, 222 kg in snatch, and 485 kg in total, with the last two records achieved only in April 2021. The next best lifters in this weight class for the season were Gor Minasyan, silver medallist in the super-heavyweight class in Rio, and his compatriot Varazdat Lalayan. They finished second and third in the last European championships with 464 kg and 445 kg, respectively, but both had not been selected for Tokyo as the Armenian Weightlifting Federation was sanctioned due to the high number of doping offences. Also not present was Fernando Reis, qualification best 436 kg, as he had tested positive for doping shortly before going to Tokyo. So, the best qualified athletes at the Games after Talakhadze were Ali Davoudi, qualification best 441 kg, Man Asaad, season best 433 kg, Walid Bidani, qualification best 431 kg, and Hojamuhammet Toýçyýew, qualification best 427 kg. Unfortunately, Bidani was not able to participate as he was tested positive for COVID-19 on arrival in Japan and again one day before the competition.
Talakhadze was untouchable, and both in snatch and clean & jerk he started his attempts only when all the other competitors had already finished their lifts. Talakhadze gave a flawless performance, not missing any of his six attempts, and finally set world records in both techniques beating his own snatch, and clean & jerk records by 1 kg each and the total record by 3 kg. Silver was also a safe proposition for Davoudi, who lifted 200 kg and 241 kg for a total of 441 kg. Only the battle for bronze provided a brief challenge as Toýçyýew tried to lift 241 kg in his last attempt but failed, which secured bronze for Asaad.
The Olympic Standard for Olympic records was 204 kg for snatch, 250 kg for clean & jerk, and 449 kg for total. Talakhadze bettered these records in five of his six lifts which meant that he set eight Olympic records, only his first clean & jerk attempt was not good enough.
Asaad’s bronze was the first ever Olympic weightlifting medal for Syria, while the fifth place of David Liti was the best ever Olympic weightlifting result for New Zealand.

One controversy concerning the 1924 10K relates to the number of runners on the race. The 1924 Official Report implies that there were 43 starters, but this number is felt to be wrong. Photographs of the race have been used in attempts to determine the number of runners, which is likely somewhere between 30 and 35. Two runners who may have competed were Eritreans Mareg Mangaschia and Tacle Redda who were entered for Italy. But Italian athletics historians are divided on whether or not they actually competed and the best evidence states that they did not.

East Germany put on an even more impressive display in the semi-finals, posting a time almost three seconds faster than its nearest competitor, defeating both the Soviets and the Britons, and eliminating the Canadians. West Germany, meanwhile, took the other heat. In the final, East Germany remained unstoppable and captured gold over two and a half seconds ahead of the silver medal-winning Americans.

Perhaps the first sign of trouble came in qualifying as Vetter needed all three attempts to get past the automatic qualifier of 83.50. He threw 85.64 in round three, which was second in qualifying behind India’s Neeraj Chopra, who threw 86.65.
In round one, with the second throw of the final, India’s Chopra threw 87.03 to take the lead, as Vetter opened with only 82.52. He would not improve, fouling in rounds two and three, and was shockingly out of the final, finishing ninth. Chopra improved in round two with 87.58 but either of his first two efforts was good for the gold medal.
Behind Chopra, Czechs Jakub Vadlejch and Vítězslav Veselý would finish second and third, with Vadlejch moving up in round five with 86.67 to claim the silver medal.

After reviewing the race, however, the judges created some controversy by handing Smith a yellow card for improper contact with Maier on the final jump. Despite protests from both skiers, this bumped Maier into the bronze medalist position, while some spectators claimed that similar actions from Thompson were ignored. After the Games ended, however, an appeals commission for the sport determined that the contact “was neither intentional [n]or unavoidable” and that Maier had finished officially in fourth, giving Smith the bronze medal. However, this was appealed to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) and in December 2022, the CAS decision was to award two bronze medals for the event, to Maier and Smith, which was approved by the IOC.

This left the division wide open. The final match saw Japan’s Koichiro Hirayama defeat Soviet Vitaly Konstantinov, but Konstantinov won the gold medal and Hirayama the bronze. To understand why, one must look at the head-to-head matches between the three finalists, which also included Romanian Nicu Gingă. In round five Hirayama lost to Gingă and was disqualified for passivity, while Konstantinov had defeated Gingă in round two by decision. Thus Konstantinov had 4 bad points in the final round, while Gingă and Hirayama both had 5 bad points. Gingă won the silver medal based on his victory over Hirayama.

He had dominated the 1962 European Championships, winning with 2.21 (7-3). The next best jumper was American John Thomas, who had been the heavy favorite in 1960, but won a disappointing bronze. Since 1960, Brumel had defeated Thomas at 8 of 9 meets. The Tokyo high jump event was much closer than expected, however, as Brumel did not win easily. In fact, he and Thomas jumped the same height, 2.18 (7-1¾), but Brumel won on the countback. He and Thomas had both needed three attempts at 2.14 (7-0¼), but those had been Brumel’s only misses. Thomas had a total of four misses, the next tie-breaker, needing two attempts at 2.12 (6-11½) and 2.16 (7-1), and had to settle for the silver medal.
Brumel was severely injured in 1965 in a motorcycle accident, sustaining a comminuted open fracture of his right tibia. He underwent several operations, but the tibia would not heal. Finally, it was healed after placement of an unusual external fixation frame, placed by Soviet orthopaedist Gavriil Ilizarov, who had pioneered what became known as the Ilizarov device, variants of which are now standard orthopaedic treatments. But Ilizarov became famous for his treatment of Brumel. After his injury, Brumel received a letter from John Thomas essentially telling him to hang in there, and telling him that he hoped he would return to jump again. In fact, Brumel did compete again, getting back up as high as 2.13 (6-11¾) in 1970, but was never again the world’s dominant jumper. Even today, he is often considered the greatest high jumper ever.

It was not certain if the event was even contested, and it was not included as an Olympic event in Mallon’s book on the 1904 Olympics The 1904 Olympic Games: Results for All Competitors, in All Events, with Commentary.
But in some more recent sources, including the 1906 Spalding Archery Guide (USA) and the 1909 Archer’s Register (GBR), results are given for this event, which doubled as the United States’ National Championships, and with the results, scores are given, certainly implying that the archer’s did at least shoot a round to earn the medal.

Winner of the 500 m, Uwe-Jens Mey, did not even start because of a flu. Those who did start suffered hard in the final lap due to the difficult ice conditions. The most spectacular failure was probably Dan Jansen’s. After surprisingly missing out on a medal in the 500 m, Jansen attempted a )fly or die) race. Having the fastest times at 200 and 600 m, he recorded one of the slowest final laps to place only 26th. While Jansen had been better known as a 500 m skater, that was not the case for Igor Zhelezovsky. The Belarussian, representing the Unified Team in Albertville,
had dominated the distance for years. Yet he also appeared powerless in the final meters, finishing 6th in the end. Other medal candidates, like Eric Flaim and Toshiyuki Kuroiwa, failed similarly.
But those skaters that did make it to the podium made it a close affair. The first to go below 1:15 was Japan’s Yukinori Miyabe, the lesser known, and thus far less successful, brother of Yasunori. His 1:14.92 was bettered by Olaf Zinke, an outsider from the German team, who recorded 1:14.85. The last two skaters to approach them skated against each other in pair 9. Kim Yun-Man and Gerard van Velde both finished very close to Zinke and Miyabe. Kim missed Zinke’s time by 0.01, while Van Velde’s gap with Miyabe was of the same size. In all, just 0.08 seconds separated first place from fourth.
The Olympic gold medal was by far Zinke’s greatest success, and it would remain that way. Earlier, he had placed well at some World Cup races, even winning two in Helsinki 1990, and collected titles in both East Germany and the reunited country. Kim, who won South Korea’s first ever Winter Olympic medal, would go on to win the 1995 World Sprint Championships. Miyabe would be among the best Japanese sprinters for several years, and would capture four World Cup wins over the years.

The result was as unlikely as it could be as Chapuis won the gold medal, leading a French medal sweep, followed by Arnaud Bovolenta and Jonathan Midol.
Despite Chapuis’s 2013 World title, he had won only one World Cup race in 32 starts, and Bovolenta and Midol had never even made a World Cup podium previously. Bovolenta’s previous best result was a sixth place earned earlier in the season at Val Thorens, while Midol’s best World Cup finish was a fourth place in 2012/13 at Les Contamines. Midol’s brother, Bastien, was much better known, having won the silver medal at the 2013 Worlds. Jonathan Midol fell shortly before the finish of the final and sprawled across the finish line for his bronze, but Leman could not contest the medal, having skidded and fallen early in the final run, conceding the medals to the French threesome.

Since placing second behind Reidar Liaklev at the 1950 European Championships, Andersen had not lost a single 10,000 m. In 1949, he had become the first man to beat 17 minutes, and in 1952 had broken the world record two more times.

He had won the 5 and 10K at the 1954 European Championships, but he was no longer the dominant skater he had been. The other most recent major titles at the distance had been won by Norwegian Knut Johannesen at the 1955 Worlds, Sweden’s Sigge Ericsson at the 1955 Europeans, and Soviet skater Oleg Goncharenko at the 1954 Worlds, who had only recently won an international meet in Davos. But also highly considered was another Soviet, Boris Shilkov, who had won the 1954 European and Worlds all-around, and had set the world record of 7:45.6 in 1955 at Medeo, bettering the previous record by 18 seconds.
Shilkov was the first favorite to start, in the fourth pair, and the mark he had to shoot at was 8:00.2 set up by the Netherlands’ Wim de Graaff. Shilkov started quickly, with by far the fastest split at 1,000 m among the contenders, and he finished just as strongly, crossing the line in 7:48.7, the second fastest time ever. The gold medal was his and nobody would approach his time, as he won by a full eight seconds. Goncharenko was next up among the contenders, but finished the sixth pair in 7:57.5, which was eventually good enough for the bronze medal. The silver went to Ericsson, skating in the eighth pair, who posted 7:56.7. But everybody held their breath as the 11th pair started, with Hjalmar Andersen. But he finished in 8:06.5 and would place only 11th.

However, competing on home soil made her one of the favourites for gold at the Tokyo Games. Arai had won the first two contests with Ippon (full point) when she faced Madina Taymazova in the semi-final. A native of North Ossetia representing the Russian Olympic Committee, her outstanding results had been bronze medals at the 2020 and 2021 European Championships. But she was able to resist Arai in a hard fight for more than 16 minutes, when the Japanese finally managed to apply an Okuri-eri-jime (choke hold) for an Ippon (full point) at 16:41 min. In the final, a foot technique called Ko-soto-gari (small outer reap) at 1:08 min earned Arai a Waza-ari (half point), which was sufficient to defeat the surprise finallist from Austrian, Michaela Polleres. But silver for the 24-year-old bronze medallist from the 2021 World Championships and 2014 Youth Olympic Games was well deserved. Due to the draw, she had to sustain one more fight to reach the final. On her way, she defeated the two top seeds, Barbara Matić and Sanne van Dijke with Waza-ari. The Dutch Van Dijke eventually claimed bronze after throwing the German Giovanna Scoccimarro after 11:44 min by O-goshi (major hip throw).
Taymazova, the second semi-final loser, suffered a serious eye injury in a previous fight, which got worse during her heroic fight against Arai. She had to go into the bronze medal contest half blinded by a swollen eye. Nevertheless, she was consoled with the medal after scoring a Waza-ari against favourite and reigning world champion Matić from Croatia. Her injury was later diagnosed as post-traumatic paraorbital hematoma (black eye).

However, the losers in heats two and three had rowed faster times than the winners of heat one and the officials wanted to conduct another qualifying heat but they were unable to contact all the teams.
The decision was made to allow the heat winners and the three fastest losing boats to compete in the final, giving a six-boat final. But the course was originally only designed for four boats, so the heat winners protested and refused to compete. The first final went off with the runner-up boat from heat two and the second- and third-place finishers from heat three. But this was satisfactory to no one and it was elected to conduct another final. This event was to be among the winners of the original three heats, and Cercle de l’Aviron Roubaix, which had won the first final.

The medal ceremony was a very unusual sight. Dill-Bundi, Bondue and Ørsted were all from nations that were protesting the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, not by boycotting, but by refusing to have their national flags at the 1980 Olympics. Thus all 3 nations were represented by the Olympic Flag, and 3 Olympic Flags were raised on the 3 flagpoles to represent the 3 medalists.

But it barely merits the name “winter,” as only two of its events, a 10 km cross-country ski race and a downhill ski race, were typical winter sports. The other three events were fencing, shooting, and horse jumping, as in the modern pentathlon. The event was decided on a point-for-place format.
The event was dominated by the Swedish athletes, who also dominated modern pentathlon in this era. Swedish skiiers took the first four places in the cross-country run, led by Bertil Haase. The shooting was then won by Gustaf Lindh, who took the lead after two events. Lindh was somewhat unusual as he was the only member of the Swedish team that never competed in another Olympic sport. Haase returned to the lead after winning the downhill skiing, with Lindh in second, and Swedish athletes in the first four places. Vincenzo Somazzi and Hans Rumpf of Switzerland then tied for first in the fencing, with seven wins but it did little to break the Swedish monopoly on the lead. In fact, going into the horse jumping final event, Lindh, Haase, and Wille Grut were tied for first with 13 points. Grut and Lindh both had perfect marks in jumping, but Lindh’s time, which was 21 seconds faster than Grut, gave him the title.
Six of the 14 competitors in the winter pentathlon competed at some time in another Olympic sport. The runner-up, Wille Grut, came back later in 1948 to win the modern pentathlon at London, and Bertil Haase also competed in the 1948 modern pentathlon, as did the Finn, Viktor Platan. The fourth Swedish pentathlete, Claes Egnell, who withdrew after the downhill, competed at London in rapid-fire pistol shooting and came back in 1952 to help Sweden win a team silver medal in modern pentathlon. British competitor Percy Legard had already competed three times at the Olympics – in 1932 and 1936 in modern pentathlon, and at Garmisch-Partenkirchen in 1936 in Nordic combined. His teammate, Derek Allhusen, who was already 34-years-old in 1948, would compete again at the Olympics in 1968 in equestrian, winning a silver medal in the individual three-day event, and leading Britain to a team gold medal.
Winter pentathlon has never again been contested at the Olympics, nor at any major international competition.

This made her only the second swimming finalist ever for Lithuania.
The final got off to a rough start when the USA’s Breeja Larson caused a stir by jumping into the pool before the start. But the official ruled that it was due to a faulty starting system in which the swimmers could not hear the )take your mark) command. She was allowed a re-start which would be a fair start. Meilutytė started the final at the same sort of pace, clear of the field at the wall, with Soni in fourth place. Soni did not make up ground until the last 15 metres when she surged and almost caught Meilutytė, but she came up short, the gold going to the young Lithuanian, with Soni getting silver. Japan’s Satomi Suzuki won bronze, over a second back of the two leaders. Larson eventually placed sixth.
Meilutytė was only 15 years, 133 days old on the day of this win, which would make her the youngest swimming gold medalist in London, just younger than Katie Ledecky (USA), who had won the 800 free at 15-137.

South Africa and New Zealand declined their invitations and Ireland, Scotland and Wales completely ignored theirs.  This left just Australia, England, and France as the participating nations.  England was originally scheduled to meet France with the winners taking on Australia but one week before the match France withdrew on the grounds that they could not raise a representative team and the two remaining teams, Australia and England, met in the only rugby match of the 1908 Games.
The Australians had no difficulty in selecting their team as their top players were already touring in England.  By the time of the Olympic rugby match, Australia had played eight matches, winning seven of them.  Conversely, the best Anglo-Welsh players were on tour in Australia and New Zealand and the Olympic match was scheduled to take place shortly after their return home.  A letter was sent to the tourists asking if they would be prepared to accept an Olympic committment so soon after an arduous tour but the letter was never received.  In the ensuing silence it was decided that Cornwall, who had won the English County Championship in March, should be Great Britain’s Olympic representatives.  During the course of their tour the Australians had already beaten Cornwall (18-5) three weeks before the Games and they scored a more emphatic victory (32-3) in the Olympic match.  The match was played on a dismal day, described by The Times as, “. . . a dark afternoon in a Scotch mist.  The ground was slippery and the footballs in a perpetual state of greasiness.”
Notable among the Australians were Danny Carroll, who won a second gold medal representing the United States in 1920, and Syd Middleton, who rowed in the Australian eight at the 1912 Games.  The Australian team continued to tour Great Britain and finished their tour with 26 wins and 5 losses, scoring 438 points, while conceding only 146.  The other members of the touring Australian rugby team, who did not play at the Olympics, were William Dix, H. Daly, Edward Mandible, Esmend Parkinson, Warden Prentice, J. M. Stevenson, Frederick Wood, Dr. Herbert M. Moran (the captain, who had injured his shoulder the previous Saturday), E. McIntyre, Kenneth Gavin, Peter H. Burge, Albert P. Burge, Norman E.

In the final, Taipale improved even more, setting two more Olympic records with his first and third throws in the final.  Duncan did not improve in the final and finished third.
The day after his discus gold medal, Taipale doubled with another gold medal in the both-hands discus competition.  In 1920, he added a silver medal in the discus to his overall record.  In 1913, he set his only world record, breaking Duncan’s mark with 47.85 at Magdeburg on 20 July 1913.  In addition to his gold medal, Taipale was the Challenge Trophy for the discus throw, which had been donated in 1908 by Mrs. G. de Montgomery.

Wichmann and Ananiev, meanwhile, raced for bronze, with the former crossing the finish line first, albeit by only 0.3 seconds. This was Ananiev’s second disappointment of the Games, as he had also come in fourth in the C-1 500. As for Patzaichin, he could not keep up to the front runners and placed fifth.

These two nations met in the opening heats, where Germany was surprisingly relegated to the semi-finals after being defeated by both Hungary and Sweden, the latter of whom could count six Olympic medals on their squad thanks to Agneta Andersson and Anna Olsson. China, the 1991 World bronze medalists, won the other, much easier heat. Germany had no trouble in the semi-finals and again faced Hungary in the medal round, where the two battled towards the finish in the final stretch of the course. The Hungarians dealt the Germans an unexpected defeat by a margin of only 0.15 seconds, claiming gold as their opponents settled for silver, while Sweden came in for bronze nearly a second and a half later.

Team/individual competitions held concurrently.",na,"The event was held concurrently with the individual competition. Teams consisted of four riders with the best three total scores counting towards the team score, thus, each nation had to have three riders complete all three phases. Nine teams completed the event. Italy had never won a medal in this event, even at Roma in 1960, but in Tokyo they won the gold medal. This was based on their endurance phase which put them ahead entering the jumping, with a third-place in the jumping phase securing the gold. Great Britain led after dressage, but could not finish the endurance course. After two phases Germany was second to Italy, with the United States third, but the US was second in jumping to move up to the silver medal, as Germany took bronze.

The Germans weren’t even favoured for the gold, as that was expected to go to either the Italians Paul Hildgartner/Walter Plaikner or the Austrians Manfred Schmid/Ewald Walch. Hildgartner/Plaikner had won the 1971 world title ahead of the Austrians, who had been champions in 1969 and 1970. But Germany entered the bronze medallists of the 1971 Worlds, Horst Hörnlein/Reinhard Bredow as well as Klaus-Michael Bonsack, reigning Olympic champion.
The competition provided the organizers with two problems. First, the starting gate malfunctioned, and the results of the first run were annulled. Then, after two runs, Hildgartner/Plaikner and Hörnlein/Bredow were tied for first place. No provisions were made for such a case, and gold medals were awarded to both teams. The Japanese lugers finished in fourth place, the best performance by a non-European luge crew at the Olympics up to 1972.

Russia was looking for medals in the event, led by 2013 World Champion Yekaterina Tudegesheva and the bronze medalist in the parallel giant slalom (PGS), Alyona Zavarzina, but the three Russian riders, including Nataliya Soboleva, all went out in the 1/8th-finals. The pre-race favorite was Switzerland’s Patrizia Kummer, who had already won the PGS, but she too failed to make the quarters.
The final came down to Austrian Julia Dujmovits against German Anke Karstens. Karstens won the first run but Dujmovits came back to give Austria its first snowboarding gold medal at the Olympics. In the bronze medal race, Amelie Kober repeated her finish at the 2013 World Championships to put two Germans on the podium, defeating Italian Corinna Boccacini.

This included the reigning World Champions Jörg Hoffmann/Jochen Pietzsch (GDR), the newly crowned European Champions Helmuth and Walter Brunner and the current World Cup champions, Hansjörg Raffl and Norbert Huber (both ITA). The pre-Olympics held in February 1983 have been won by the Austrians Fluckinger/Wilhelmer in 1:23.667 followed by Belyakov/Belousov and Lemmerer/Sulzbacher.
Competition was very close and after one run, the Soviet couple of Aleksandr Belyakov and Yevgeny Belousov led by 0.067 seconds over the West Germans, Franz Wembacher and Hans Stanggassinger. While the Germans had medalled before at international tournaments, the Soviets were yet unheralded. They were close to winning the gold medal in the second run, but made a minor error close to the finish line. This cost them one tenth of a second, enough to drop down to second place. The difference between first and second, 0.040 seconds, was the smallest since two duos had tied for first place in 1972. The gold medal for Wembacher and Stanggassinger was the first ever in Olympic luge for West Germany.

With no clear favorite, people looked to East German Roger Pyttel, silver medalist in both butterfly events at the 1975 World Championships, and in the semi-finals he posted 54.75, the second fastest time in history. The next three fastest qualifiers for the final were the American trio of Matt Vogel (54.80), the 1976 NCAA champion in the event, Joe Bottom (55.26), and Gary Hall (55.32). Pyttel could not match his semi-final effort and the final was all-USA, as Vogel led an American sweep in 54.35, followed by Bottom in 54.50, and Hall in 54.65, the 2-3-4 times in the event.
Gary Hall had come to Montréal, by defying the odds of trying to make an Olympic team while a medical student. He had been on the 1968 and 1972 teams and was a surprise in making the 1976 USA team. The US team members then selected him to carry the US flag at the Opening Ceremony, and his bronze medal capped his swimming career, as he related, “When I saw the sweep I almost came to tears.” Hall would later become an ophthalmologist and return to the Olympic pools to watch his son, Gary Hall, Jr., win 10 Olympic medals, including five gold.

For Nuesslein, the decision backfired, as he recorded a 54 and only won the bronze medal in a shoot-off. Carl Osburn had won five shooting medals at the 1912 Olympics and added six more in Antwerp, giving him 11 in all - the most ever by an American Olympian, equalled by Mark Spitz over 50 years later in 1972, and bettered by Jenny Thompson in 2004 with 12.
