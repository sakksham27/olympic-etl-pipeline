In round five Mahdizadeh defeated Gardzhev, but that eliminated Mahdizadeh as he had already accumulated 5 bad points after four rounds. In second place after four rounds was American Dan Brand, but he was eliminated when Güngör defeated him in round five, leaving Gardzhev and Güngör to meet for the title. They fought only to a draw, however, which gave the gold medal to Gardzhev because of lower bodyweight, with Güngör winning silver and Brand the bronze medal. Mahdizadeh would go on to win the 1965 World title, with Gardzhev winning again in 1966. Brand never wrestled competitively again, taking up a career as an engineer.

He qualified for the final, but would place only 14th. Józef Szmidt had won the 1958 European Championships and a few weeks before the Olympics, he won the Polish Championships with a world record of 17.03 (55-10½), the first jump past the 17-metre barrier. Szmidt won the gold medal in round one, jumping 16.78 (55-0¾), which nobody could better, except him. He did so in round three with 16.81 (55-2).

Brazil’s Robert Scheidt had won the gold medal in this event in 1996 and 2004, and then added the 2005 World Championship, his eighth World title in the class. He left this class wide-open, however, when he then switched over to the Star class, in which he won a silver medal in Qingdao. Britain’s Paul Goodison, who had been second to Scheidt at the 2005 World Championship and was a four-time European Champion, came through to win the Laser gold medal in 2008, taking a big lead into the medal race. Leading comfortably over Sweden’s Rasmus Myrgren, Goodison only had to avoid finishing last, and having Myrgren win the race, to win gold. Goodison engaged in a match race with Myrgren, preventing him from passing and pushing him back into last place, as Goodison finished ninth. This dropped Myrgren down to sixth overall, and clinched gold for Goodison. The beneficiary of this battle was Slovenian Vasilij Žbogar, who moved up to the silver medal after winning a bronze medal in Laser in 2004.

In Rio they made a further breakthrough by winning three Olympic medals and finishing top of the sport’s medal table.
In the light-welterweight division their challenge was spearheaded by Fazliddin Gaybnazarov, a world championship bronze medallist. Gaybnazarov survived a knockdown against American Gary Russell to gain a controversial split decision victory before edging another close win over Russian world champion Vitaly Dunaytsev.
His opponent in the Olympic final was a man with a familial link to the Olympics and an unusual life story. Lorenzo Sotomayor was the nephew of 1992 high jump champion Javier Sotomayor. He had been a promising youngster in the Cuban system until he met and fell in love with a visitor to Cuba, a Russian girl who lived in Azerbaijan, and followed her there. He gained Azeri nationality in time to win gold at the 2015 European Games.
The final was a difficult fight to score and opinion was divided as to who deserved to be called the winner. Judges from Sweden and Morocco were of the opinion that Fazliddin Gaybnazarov just did enough to win and thus earn Uzbekistan their third boxing gold of 2016.

She won her first match by ippon but was then pushed in the pool semi and final. In the class final she faced China’s Liu Xia. Liu was not well known internationally but had finished second in the 2004 Asian Games. The final was tight throughout, but Anno won the gold medal by ippon with only 22 seconds remaining in the match.

But in the run-up to the Games Maureen Gardner, a 19-year-old ballet dancer from Oxford, had clocked 11.2. Although not recognized as a World Record, this propelled her into the role of contender, especially in the eyes of the British media. Her main opponent would be Blankers-Koen, the reigning European Champion. Gardner struggled and stumbled through the first rounds, while Blankers-Koen equalled the World Record in the heats. In the final, Gardner appeared to move slightly before the start, causing Blankers-Koen to assume a false start. But the race went on, giving Gardner a clear lead by the first hurdle. Blankers-Koen quickly pulled next to her, racing side-to-side until the finish line. For a brief moment the runners where unaware who had won. When “God Save the King” was played, the Dutchwoman assumed she had lost. But the national anthem was played because of the arrival of the Royal Family, and the announcer then confirmed a win in World Record time for Blankers-Koen. According to automatic timing uncovered later, she had won the race by 0.05, but in 1948, both runners where given the same hand time.

By 1996, he was a prohibitive favorite, not having lost since 1994 over 200 metres, and had won the 1995 World Championships. He was looking for a 200/400 double in Atlanta. At the US Olympic Trials, Johnson finally bettered Pietro Mennea’s world record from 1979, running 19.66 to make the US team. His challengers were felt to be Namibian Frankie Fredericks, the 1992 silver medalist, and Trinidad’s Ato Boldon. Only two weeks before the Olympics, Fredericks had beaten Johnson, snapping his win streak at the distance. By the night of the 200 final Johnson had already won his 400 gold medal. Coming off the curve, there was little to choose between the three favorites, Johnson having a slight lead. But then he found another gear, finishing in 19.32, a time that seemed almost like a mistake. Fredericks held on for his second consecutive silver medal with Boldon winning bronze. Boldon later said, )19.32. That’s not a time. It sounds like my dad’s birthday.)

He seemed especially lucky to defeat European champion Joseph Ventaja in a hotly disputed semi-final bout. Zachara, a locksmith by profession, won the gold by defeating Sergio Caprari of Italy. This was the only major tournament title for the Slovakian Zachara who returned to unsuccessfully defend his title in 1956.

Allied to the fact that, for various reasons, none of the previous three world champion pilots, Felix Endrich and Fritz Feierabend of Switzerland and Guglielmo Scheibmeier of Italy were present in Cortina this should in theory have made predictions difficult.
Whether it was the local knowledge of Italian pilots Lamberto Dalla Costa and Eugenio Monti, the innovative design of their Podar-designed sleds, or just superior driving ability that conspired to give the host nation a resounding victory mattered little. The truth of the matter was that as soon as the first Italian bob reached the finish of its’ first run it was obvious that, barring a crash, a home victory was assured. Dalla Costa, who rarely competed on any track other than Cortina, led his compatriot by 0.8 seconds at the halfway stage but was four seconds clear of the third-place team. By the finish of the competition six seconds separated the Italians from the rest of the field. In comparison the battle for bronze was hard fought between Switzerland, the United States and Olympic bobsleigh débutants Spain and was only decided in favour of the Swiss on the final run. Piloting the Spanish bob was the remarkable multi-talented sporting aristocrat, the Marquis de Portago.
De Portago was the driving force behind the creation of the Spanish bobsleigh team and populated it with friends and relations. In the modern era he may well have been described as an “adrenalin junkie” because as well as his bobsleigh career he was a racing driver who was placed second at the British Formula One Grand Prix in 1955, three-times champion amateur jockey of France and a competitor in the English Grand National Steeplechase as well as being a top-class swimmer and squash player. He would pilot Spain to a bronze medal in the 1957 World Championship but would be dead by the end of the year, the victim of a gruesome crash that also claimed 11 other lives in the classic Italian sports car race, the Mille Miglia.
Eugenio Monti, a former national skiing champion, would go on to dominate this event for the next decade and won six of the next seven world titles. If bobsleigh had been contested at the 1960 Winter Games he would have started as a red hot favourite but instead he had to wait another twelve years to become Olympic champion.

Martikán had taken it in 1996 and 2008 alongside silver medals in 2000 and 2004, making him the most decorated Olympic slalom competitor, and was the individual (1997, 2002, 2003, 2007) and team (1997, 2003, 2009, 2010, 2011) World Champion a total of nine times. Estanguet was Olympic Champion in 2000 and 2004 and World Champion for the individual event in 2006, 2009, and 2010, with team victories in 2005 and 2007. The hometown favorite for Britain was David Florence, who was ranked #1 in the discipline worldwide and had won silver in the event at the 2008 Games.
Martikán exited the preliminary rounds with the fastest time, but fell to fourth in the semi-finals in a round won by Germany’s Sideris Tasiadis. Florence hit a gate during this part of the event and incurred a two-second penalty to his time, enough to drop him from seventh place to tenth and outside of the advancing field. Martikán had a solid run in the final, but was overtaken by Estanguet, who won the event. An excellent run by Tasiadis earned him the silver medal, leaving the Slovakian competitor with bronze, the first time he had ever finished below runner-up in an Olympic tournament.

The event started on 14 February but after half of the jumping was finished, it was postponed to the next day due to high winds. The next day, the Germans took the lead in the jumping, led by Georg Hettich, who had won the jumping portion of the individual event, and would do the same in the sprint a week later. Germany’s lead going into the relay was 10 seconds over Austria, 23 over Russia, and 35 over Finland. It was not enough. The German lead-off, Jens Gaiser, extended the lead to 37 seconds.

Prior to the Beijing Olympics, many endurance athletes had complained about the air pollution in Beijing but, on the day of the road race, it was relatively clear for the Chinese capital city. The first major break occurred at 60 km., with 26 riders going away. They were in front for almost 125 km. The peleton caught them with 60 km. remaining in the race, but by then two riders, Aleksandr Kuchinsky (BLR) and Ruslan Pidhorniy (UKR), had broken away. They were reeled in after only a few kilometers in the lead.
On the last lap, repeated attacks left only 20 riders in the front group. From this group six riders got into a breakaway – Samuel Sánchez (ESP), Davide Rebellin (ITA), Fabian Cancellara (SUI), Aleksandr Kolobnev (RUS), Andy Schleck (LUX), and Michael Rogers (AUS). Sánchez and Rebellin were the most aggressive riders in the break, until Cancellara tried to go off the front, but he was quickly pulled back. Cancellara was not known as a sprinter, but was a great time trialist, and he often used this strength to get away before the sprint. The final sprint was close with all six finishing within a bike length, but Sánchez was the fastest off the top of the Badaling climb, and edged our Rebellin for the gold medal, with Cancellara taking bronze, or so it seemed.
In November 2009, however, Davide Rebellin, the original silver medalist, was disqualified when his sample from Beijing tested positive for CERA (continuous erythropoietin receptor activator), which stimulates erythropoietin (EPO) production and increases hemoglobin levels for better oxygen usage. Switzerland’s Fabian Cancellara, who won the individual time trial gold medal in Beijing, was moved up to the silver medal position and Russian Aleksandr Kolobnev was awarded the bronze medal.

A heavy rain fell on the day before the phase which made things worse on the course. Only 15 of 48 starters successfully negotiated The Pond. Coincidently, perhaps, the Germans, who had trained on the course, had no problems and their horses all negotiated the fence safely, taking a wider and much longer line to the left side of the fence.
German Ludwig Stubbendorf took a big lead in the opening dressage and extended it in the cross-country by winning that phase, meaning he basically only had to stay upright in the jumping to win the gold medal, and he did so comfortably. Silver went to American Earl Thomson aboard Jenny Camp, repeating their finish together at Los Angeles in 1932. Thomson performed poorly in the dressage and was well behind, but placed fifth in cross-country, and was equal fourth in the jumping to secure his silver medal. Danish riders placed third and fourth, with Hans Lunding winning the bronze medal ahead of his teammate Vincens Grandjean.

Behind Obiri and Hassan, Ethiopian Gudaf Tsegay was also considered a medal contender.
The 5K final took place in the evening in stifling humidity, and a 24° C. (75° F.) dew point, and despite a light rain, nobody wanted to take the pace out quickly. Japan’s Ririka Hironaka led through 1,000 metres and then Ethiopian Ejgayehu Taye took the field through to 4K, as 11 runners remained in the lead pack.
At that point, Obiri knew she had to move to blunt Hassan’s kick. At the bell only five runners were left in medal contention, led by Obiri, but Hassan sprinted by her on the backstretch to take the lead, and increased her lead to 12 metres as she crossed the line for the gold medal. Obiri held on for silver as Tsegay took bronze.
Hassan was far from finished, as she would run the 1,500 final in four days, earning a bronze medal. She would come back the day after that to win the 10,000, finishing the Tokyo Olympics with a remarkable two golds and one bronze in the three distance events.

When the slalom started, Austria’s Pepi Stiegler had already won an Olympic silver medal (1960 giant slalom) and bronze medal (1964 giant slalom). He easily made it through the qualifying and led the first run of the final, followed by Austrian team leader Karl Schranz and American Jimmy Heuga in third. The second run leader was France’s Guy Périllat, who had barely finished the first run in the final, and moved up only to 12th place. The second best time was posted by American Billy Kidd, earning him the overall lead. Heuga followed three skiers later, and although he would have the third best time of the second run, he could not move ahead of Kidd overall. Stiegler was off 15th, the last of the top seeds in the run, and would finish eighth in the run, but with a time that enabled him to win the gold medal by a narrow margin over Kidd. Stiegler eventually settled in the United States, finally in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, and his daughter, Resi Stiegler, would later ski in the Olympics for the United States.
Prior to 1964, and Billy Kidd and Jimmy Heuga, no American man had won a skiing medal at the Olympics. Previously the best finishes were fourth by Brooks Dodge in the 1956 slalom and Tom Corcoran in the 1960 giant slalom.

By a strange coincidence, Wu played a bit part in a 2003 Chinese movie called “Taekwondo”, which told the story of a character winning gold at Beijing in 2008 and London in 2012 – just as Wu did. Thailand’s number two seed Panipak Wongpattanakit was dominated by Wu in 2015, but was the only fighter able to land a head kick on her.

The number two seed, Wongpattanakit, also fell at the quarter-final stage, losing 6-5 to Kim So-hui of South Korea. Remarkably, all of the top four seeds went at the last eight stage with local favourite Sing losing heavily, 14-4, to Mexico’s Itzel Manjarrez.

It was played between the United States and France.  The U.S. squad was made up of American football players from California colleges, notably Stanford, California, and Santa Clara.  The French team was composed of players from four clubs near Paris: Racing Club de France, Olympique Paris, Club Athlétique des Sports Généraux, and the Sporting Club Universitaire de Paris.  In a major upset the United States won, 8-0, despite most of the players being fairly new to the sport of rugby football.  The United States scored with a try (five points) and a field goal (three points), both in the second half.
One of the United States team members, Rudy Scholz of the University of Santa Clara, wrote about the Olympic match for a local paper, “About the game.  It started at 5 PM, (time here for all big matches) and there was a crowd of about 20,000 present, despite the fact it was raining.  At a council of war we decided that because the ground was wet and slippery and the ball likewise, we would make it a forward game.  The French tried a backfield game, and they lost although they were fast.  The slippery ball and field proved their undoing.  Our forwards outweighed the French easily, and ‘Babe’ Slater was a wonder in the line-outs, as was Mahoney, Fish, and Tilden.  We in the backfield didn’t have one passing rush, but our defense was superb, and Templeton did not have one tackle to make.  Those from Santa Clara in the final line up were [James] Fitzpatrick, [John] Muldoon, [John] O’Neil and myself.  Bill Muldoon and [James] Winston did not play.  Score end of first half 0-0.  Middle of second half our forwards dribbled to the French’s ten yard line and then we marked a kick directly in front of the goal and [“Dink”] Templeton put it over 3-0.  Latter part of second half we dribbled to their five yard line and when the French first five fumbled, [Joseph] Hunter picked it up and fell over the line.  Converted.  Final score 8-0.”
After the Olympic competition, the U.S. Olympic rugby team toured France and played four games.  On 19 September, in Lyons, the U.S. team defeated a team representing the southeast of France, 26-0.  A southern French team then lost to the U.S. team in Toulouse, 14-3, and then at Bordeaux, a southwest French team lost, 6-3.  Finally, in Paris, on 10 October, a French national team defeated the U.S., 14-5.
Rugby football had been contested at the 1919 Inter-Allied Games, with a round-robin tournament between France, Romania, and the United States.  Both France and the United States defeated Romania, and France then defeated the United States, 8-3, on 29 June 1919 to win the event.

The 1999 title went to American Michael Bennett, who was the United States’ 2000 representative in this class. Savón’s 1997 World title was somewhat questionable as he lost in the final to Uzbeki Ruslan Chagayev, but Chagayev was disqualified when it was revealed that he fought some professional bouts in the United States. In an odd ruling in 1998 he was reinstated to the amateur ranks when the fights were declared exhibitions, and he was in Sydney.
But it mattered little. Chagayev lost in the quarter-finals, and Savón was unstoppable. He pummeled Bennett in the quarter-finals before the ref stopped the fight near the end of the third round. Savón then won two easy decisions to win his third consecutive gold medal, joining Hungary’s László Papp and his countryman, Teófilo Stevenson as the only Olympic boxers (through 2008) with three gold medals. After the victory ceremony, Savón announced his retirement.

One concern in 1996 was the effect on the horses of the extreme heat of the southern United States summer in the eventing endurance phase. The Organizing Committee took significant measures to prevent the horses from overheating, including starting the endurance competition at 0700. The endurance course distance was reduced from 26,950 metres to 19,695 metres. Mesh covers were placed over large portions of the course, to block direct sunlight, and misting stations wet and cooled the horses at several locations. There were multiple veterinarians and ambulances available, but due to the precautions, there were no major injuries to the horses.
There was no clear favorite as, in recent years, several different riders had won the three main events at the Badminton Horse Trials, the Burghley Horse Trials, and the Rolex Kentucky International. New Zealand had entered Mark Todd, the 1984 and 1988 gold medalist, but shortly before the event started, his horse pulled a muscle, so his teammate, Blyth Tait, bronze medalist in 1992, was substituted. After the endurance phase, Tait moved into the lead, 3.6 points ahead of her teammate, Sally Clark. Clark rode first in the jumping and went clear, forcing Tait to do the same. At the 12th jump, of 15, Tait’s horse Ready Teddy hit the top rail hard, but it stayed up, and they finished the course cleanly to win the gold medal, as Clark took silver. The bronze medal was closely fought as well, as American Kerry Milliken and France’s Jean Teulère were tied going into the jumping, just over one point ahead of Milliken’s teammate, David O’Connor. All three had difficulty in the jumping, but Milliken’s 6.50 faults was good enough to bring her the bronze medal as Teulère finished fourth and O’Connor fifth.

At 10 km, Zimyatov was in the lead, 13 seconds ahead of the Swede Thomas Wassberg. Lying third, to everyone’s surprise, was Bulgarian Ivan Lebanov, 1977 Junior World Champion, 19.5 seconds behind the leader. And the young Bulgarian continued to impress. At the halfway mark he had moved up to second place, 36 seconds behind the leading Zimyatov, but he was closely followed by Wassberg and Soviet Vasily Rochev. Zimyatov continued to push the pace, at 20 km he had widened his lead to 40 seconds, but behind him it was very close: Wassberg now second, Lebanov third and Rochev fourth, all three within 8 seconds. Rochev, starting first of the favorites, was fastest over the last 10 km and finished in impressive style. Zimyatov, starting one minute behind Lobanov, caught the Bulgarian 5 km from home, and they finished together. Zimyatov came in half a minute ahead of his countryman Rochev, and Lobanov was now in bronze medal position. Wassberg, starting last of all, could not match Lobanov’s speed over the last kilometers and had to be content with fourth place.

Only in the semi-final did either of the duo suffer the risk of elimination. Denis Dmitriyev of Russia took race one of the semi-final against Kenny, becoming the first non-British rider to win a heat against a British rider since 2004, but Kenny recovered to win in three races.
The final was an anti-climax as Kenny’s superior track craft proved too much for his less experienced opponent and he won with a heat to spare. Dmitriyev’s match against Australian Matthew Glaetzer was equally as one sided in the Russian’s favour. Kenny became only the third man to retain an Olympic title in this event after Daniel Morelon and Jens Fiedler.

Ice in the run-in made the conditions difficult, and in the first round the jumpers were given reduced speed. The highly favored Norwegian team consisted of four jumping specialists, led by defending Olympic Champion Jacob Tullin Thams who also was the winner of the World Championships in 1926. After the first round, it looked like a new triumph for the Norwegians with Alf Andersen leading with the longest jump of the round of 60 m ahead of Sigmund Ruud  and Thams. The fourth Norwegian, Hans Kleppen, was out of contention after a fall. The most dangerous threat to the Norwegians was the winner of the Nordic Combined jumping event, Rudolf Burkert, and the home favorite Gérard Vuilleumier.
In the break between the two rounds the Middle Europeans, led by the Swiss jumpers Vuilleumier and Bruno Trojani, requested top speed for the in-run, but the Scandinavians and US jumpers protested and argued that on the icy and fast snow this would be too dangerous. The quarrel lasted for 40 minutes, and in the end the Middle Europeans got what they wanted. The two leading Norwegians, Andersen and Ruud kept their head cool and left the tower in standing position to avoid full speed. They produced the two longest standing jumps of the competition with 64.0 and 62.5 m.  Defending champion Thams, however, was furious. Instead of taking a safe jump to win a medal, he was provoked by the Swiss jumpers taunting him about his cowardice, and gave full speed to produce a magnificent jump of 73.0 m. without a clean landing. Ironically, both Vuilleumier and Trojani became victims of the high speed and fell after jumps of 62.0 and 63.0 meters.
The competition ended with gold and silver for Norway. Alf Andersen became Olympic Champion, and Sigmund Ruud, the eldest of the famous Ruud brothers from Kongsberg, was second. Rudolf Purkert won the bronze medal, the first ever medal for his country in the Winter Olympics.

Before the race, Soukup’s best finish in the sprint in international competition was 27th at the 2013 World Championships. Also surprising were several of the names missing from the podium, including Frenchman Martin Fourcade, who finished sixth, and Norwegian Emil Hegle Svendsen, who placed ninth.

With a decorated past as a track cyclist that included six gold medals at the World Championships and four at the Olympics, his more recent successes as a road cyclist included second place in the time trial at the 2011 World Championships and an overall win of the Tour de France less than two weeks prior. This made him the favorite to capture the gold in the 2012 Olympic Time Trial, but he had to contend with Tony Martin, the reigning World Champion and perhaps the only rider who could truly challenge Wiggins for the top spot; Martin’s injury-plagued season, however, left his ability to challenge for the gold in doubt. The defending Olympic champion Fabian Cancellara was a potential challenger as well, but the crash he suffered during the road race several days earlier hampered his speed during the time trial and he was never a factor for the podium.
There were no surprises in the race: Wiggins dominated the course throughout and Martin came in with a comfortable second-place finish. Wiggins’ teammate Christopher Froome, who had come in second overall at the most recent Tour de France, took home the bronze. Wiggins’ victory gave him the highest lifetime total of medals for a British Olympian with seven, although the man he surpassed, rower Steven Redgrave, still held the title of most successful Olympian with five gold medals compared to Wiggins’ four.

Now that professionals were eligible, they returned to competition and won the 1994 European Championships shortly before the Olympics. The 1993 World Champions had been Maya Usova and Aleksandr Zhulin, the 1992 bronze medalists. A married couple, they pioneered a highly sensual dance style, some would say erotic. The second best Russian pair featured Oksana “Pasha” Grishchuk and Yevgeny Platov. Off the ice, Pasha Grishchuk was the sensual, erotic one. She wanted to be an actress, and also had designs on Usova’s husband, Aleksandr Zhulin. They began an affair together, which resulted in a confrontation in a Los Angeles restaurant, when Usova punched Grishchuk. The Russian figure skating federation tried to split up Grishchuk and Platov, but they left their assigned coaches and again began skating together. With that background, the 1994 ice dance event was highly anticipated.
In the compulsory dances, the two Russian couples split being ranked first, and were tied for first after the compulsories, with T&D third. Torvill and Dean won the optional set pattern dance, which moved them into a virtual tie with Usova and Zhulin, although T&D were ahead based on a tie-breaker. Grishchuk and Platov were close behind in third, but whoever won the free dance would win the gold medal. Usova and Zhulin skated first and received scores of all 5.8s and 5.9s. Torvill and Dean were next, skating to Irving Berlin’s Let’s Face the Music and Dance. They skated well, and the audience loved them, but the judges did not feel the same. They received five scores of 5.7 and one of 5.6 for technical merit. High artistic impression scores could not bring them above Usova and Zhulin. Grishchuk and Platov were the last on the ice, skating to Rock Around the Clock. Their scores ranged from 5.7 to 6.0 and it was difficult to choose between them and Usova and Zhulin. In the end, the younger couple won the gold medal, Grishchuk and Platov ranked first in the free dance by five judges, Usova and Zhulin by three, and the British judge giving their vote to T&D.

Gyarmati would lead Hungary to medals at the next five Olympics and is usually considered, with Spain’s Manuel Estiarte, one of the two greatest water polo players of all-time.
There were several matches in early rounds that were replayed after protests against referee decision, notably Hungary vs Egypt, and Italy vs Yugoslavia. After the Egyptian protest, the Hungarian Ministry of Education cabled the London Organizing Committee that “Hungary would withdraw from the Games if there are further anti-sporting manifestations such as the annulment of the Hungarian-Egyptian water polo match.” Newspapers reported that the Egyptians eventually withdrew their protest but a new match was still held, with basically the same result. Yugoslavia protested the first match against Italy for refereeing decisions, including “raising the wrong foul flag.” In Group D, Australia protested before their match against Italy about the corks and guidelines marking the playing area, and the referee noted that the match was “played under protest.”

In doing so he reversed the standings from the most recent World Championships and broke the 48-year stranglehold that Hungarian sabre fencers had on the Olympic title.

Pawłowski’s story is one of contrasts.

What was not known in his homeland until after he had retired from the sport was that Pawłowski, a major in the Polish Army, had been a spy for the CIA for over a decade. He was revealed as a spy in 1975 and was sentenced to 25 years in prison. After 10 years he was pardoned by the Polish government and released.

Both were little known, although Bikov had won the clean & jerk at the 1971 Worlds, and Tarabulsi had won a bronze in the snatch at the 1970 Worlds. When Bikov jerked 185.0 kg, the gold medal was his, with Tarabulsi taking silver, just ahead of Italian Anselmo Silvino, who had also been overall bronze medalist at the 1971 World Championships. Through 2016, Tarabulsi’s medal in 1972 is the only Olympic medal won by a Lebanese lifter.

In the final, Nomura faced Italy’s Girolamo Giovinazzo, who was a former European Champion (1994) and had twice been Mediterranean Champion. Giovinazzo led for much of the match but with less than 30 seconds remaining, Nomura used seoi-nage to win by ippon. Though Nomura’s gold medal was considered a major upset, he would soon dominate this class, winning three consecutive Olympic gold medals and the 1997 World Championship. Giovinazzo never won another major title after his 1994 European gold, but was a very consistent performer at the Europeans, six times placing on the podium.

The impressive showing of the young Olympic Athletes from Russia Nataliya Nepryayeva, Yuliya Belorukova, the only individual female medal winner from Russia at these Games, Anastasiya Sedova and Anna Nechayevskaya took them to the bronze medal.
Right from the start, the Russian youngsters set the pace, with Norway’s Østberg having a hard time to be close on Nepryayeva’s heels. At the first exchange, surprisingly, Anamarija Lampič kept Slovenia in second place. For Sweden, one of the two favorites, Anna Haag, had a slow start and was in fifth place. On the second leg, it was Charlotte Kalla, who ran the fastest time, and made up 24 seconds on Belorukova. On the other hand, Jacobsen was Norway’s weakest link on the second position. She had an illness at the beginning of the Games and at the end of the leg exchanged in fourth place, some 30 seconds behind the Olympic Athletes from Russia, who held the lead from Sweden, Finland’s Kerttu Niskanen holdng third, 20 seconds ahead of Jacobsen, when the freestyle skiers took over.
Now it was Ragnhild Haga’s turn to close the gap on the O.A.R. and Sweden. She clocked the fastest time, and finished on third place, just three seconds behind the leading duo of Sedova and Sweden’s Ebba Andersson. The chasing “group” of Switzerland with Nathalie von Siebenthal and Finland with Riitta-Liisa Roponen had already lost the chances of a medal with a 40-second gap between them and the top three teams. On the last leg, the race boiled down to a duel between distance skier Bjørgen, and sprint gold medalist Stina Nilsson. The Norwegian kept up a high pace, but could not shake off Nilsson. However, Nechayevskaya succumbed to Bjørgen’s pace, and in the end was desperately trying to hold Finland’s top skier Krista LPärmäkoski at bay for the bronze medal position. In the lead, Bjørgen further increased the pace leaving Nilsson no chance to attack on the last kilometre. At the finish line, Sweden was just two seconds behind.
The teams from Finland and the United States were not strong enough to do better than fourth and fifth eventually. On the home stretch, Germany passed Switzerland for an honorable sixth place.

The 1972 champion György Gedó, who became the first boxer to appear at four Olympics, fell to Ramos in the quarter-finals as both the Cuban and Soviet had straightforward paths to the final. The gold medal bout was a frantic affair with Sabirov holding the centre of the ring as the fleet footed Ramos circled him attempting to jab through his guard. Sabirov’s defence held and he picked off the Cuban as he moved into close quarters. The Russian was awarded the verdict and the title but only by a 3-2 majority of the judges.

Hungarian Katinka Hosszú had probably been the world’s best all-around swimmer in the last few years but struggled in Tokyo and never swam to her potential.

If Jamie Anderson, the two-time Olympic gold medalist in snowboard slopestyle won the big air title she would become the first woman to earn three gold medals in snowboarding. Julia Marino was one of the most progressive women in the sport over the last few seasons and one of the athletes who helped make doubles a competition standard in this event.

Van der Weijden’s victory was amongst the most emotional triumphs of the entire 2008 Games as his promising career has seemingly ended in 2001 when he was diagnosed with leukemia. With the aid of stem cell treatment he had returned after a two-year absence to resume his swimming career. Van der Weijden had won bronze at the 2006 European Championships in the 10K. At the 2008 World Championships in open water swimming, he won the gold medal in the 25 km. In 2018 he attempted to swim the entire course of the famed speed skating race through canals, the elfstedentocht, to raise money for cancer research, a 200 km swim. Van der Weijden swam sections of the course over 3 days but finally had to stop due to illness only 10 km from finishing the entire course.

Golovkin had a remarkable record in the amateur ranks and at the start of the Athens games had only lost 3 of his 300+ fights.  After an untroubled run to the semi-finals he saw off the challenge of the fancied American Andre Dirrell to set up a meeting with Sydney Olympic finalist Gaydarbek Gaydarbekov of Russia for the gold medal. 
Gaydarebekov had recently won the European Championships at the middleweight limit but it was still a surprise when he recovered from a four-point deficit at the end of the 1st round to dominate the last half of the fight and become the 1st Russian to win gold in the this division since [Vyacheslav Lemeshev] won for the Soviet Union in 1972. This was the high point of Gaydarebekov’s career and he drifted into retirement shortly after the Games ended.
Golovkin suffered a shock defeat at the 2005 World Championships and afterwards decided to embark on a career as a professional. By 2013 he was established as one of the stars of the sport and has held the WBA world title since 2010.

Mathis had impressed as much with his hand speed as his power in the US trials and he seemed a certainty for Olympic gold but Mathis never got to travel to Tokyo, let alone fight for gold. A hand injury forced his withdrawal and he was replaced by Joe Frazier, the man he defeated to clinch a place on the Olympic team. Frazier took his opportunity with gusto and made quick work of his first two opponents. A sterner test appeared to wait in the shape of Soviet sailor Vadim Yemelyanov in the semi-final but the only difference this time was that the humiliation lasted an extra round and that Yemelyanov was a resilient punch bag. Opposing Frazier in the final was the experienced Hans Huber of Germany.  Huber had noted Frazier’s performances and attempted to use his speed and footwork to negate the American’s punching ability. The fight reached the final bell and two of the judges agreed that Huber had succeeded in his mission but the three others voted in favour of Frazier and the American took the gold medal home.
Frazier turned professional in the aftermath of the Games and, though overshadowed by the exploits of Muhammad Ali, established himself as one the all-time legends of his sport. He became heavyweight champion of the world in 1967, ironically by beating his old rival Buster Mathis, and four years later became the first man to defeat Ali in the “Fight of the Century“ at Madison Square Garden in New York. He lost his crown and his undefeated record to George Foreman in 1973 and lost a rematch to Ali early the following year. A third fight with Ali, “The Thrilla in Manilla“, is perhaps rated as the greatest, and most brutal, fight of all time.

But he had been beaten in July by Tanzania’s Filbert Bayi who had moved up to this event from the 1,500/mile. Bayi, a noted front runner, took the lead from the start and was on world record pace thru two kilometres. He had a 30-metre lead on Malinowski by then, but the Pole slowly closed the gap, coming to five metres back at the bell. Malinowski took the lead over the water jump on the final lap and won quite easily, Bayi hanging on for the silver medal. This was the last time the steeplechase was not won by a Kenyan, thru at least 2016..

In the round-robin the Americans led with four wins and one loss, followed by Denmark, with three wins and two losses. Those two boats had also been 1-2 in the fleet racing. Germany and Great Britain were the other two crews moving on to the semi-finals. Chalk held in the semis as both the US and Denmark won their matches, 2-0. The favored Americans, however, lost two straight races in the final, as Denmark won the gold medal. Great Britain defeated Germany, 2-1, in the bronze medal races.

In the opening round, Australia and France were indeed victorious in their heats, the latter in the round’s best time, but Denmark struggled and finished last in a heat won by Italy.  The Danes survived by winning the repêchage, but lost to the Italians again in the semi-finals, albeit not by anywhere near as large of a margin. Australia and France, meanwhile, met in this round and had an exhilarating race, with the former edging the latter out by a mere 0.03 seconds at the finish line. In the final, however, it was France who gained the upper hand and won by a slightly more comfortable 0.41 seconds, leaving the Australians with silver. Denmark, meanwhile, finally managed to get the best of the Italians, but not by much, capturing bronze by a margin of only 0.26 seconds.

Toscani’s passage to the final took him past Ludvigsen (Denmark) and the Swede Kjällander in the early rounds then on to a semi-final meeting with Belgian Leonard Steyaert. Winning the decision over Steyaert he found himself pitted against the Czech Jan Heřmánek. Heřmánek had reached the final with a victory over Fred Mallin, brother of the double gold medalist Harry Mallin.
Reports suggest Toscani was extremely lucky to have been awarded the decision over Heřmánek in the final and the Czech contingent in the hall were convinced an injustice had occurred. The losing fighter’s supporters picked him up, carried him round the hall and eventually put him down in front of the judge’s table. Heřmánek then had a frank discussion with the judges whilst the demonstration turned to a violent protest in the arena. Not for the first time at the tournament, the police had to step in to restore order.

Prior to the Games, she might have feared stiff competition from compatriot, Anni Friesinger, winner of the only 5,000 m World Cup race earlier in the season. But Friesinger had not done well in the Olympic 3,000 m, while Pechstein had won that race.
Instead competition for Pechstein came from two women who had only recently picked up speed skating again. Canadian Clara Hughes had been a speed skater before choosing a cycling career that earned her two Olympic bronze medals in the 1996 Games. She had picked up her old sport again in 2001, and had set a time of 7.00,10 at the Canadian Olympic Trials. Gretha Smit had been the surprise of the Dutch Olympic Trials. Dominant in women’s marathon skating, she had taken a stab at long track skating, and had overwhelmingly won the 3,000 m and 5,000 m at the selection competition.
Skating in the first pair, Smit shattered Niemann’s world record, which had been set in March 2001, lowering it to 6:49.22. Only in the sixth pair did Hughes manage to approach the time with 6:53.53, mainly due to her steady final laps. Undaunted by these times, Pechstein set off faster than Smit. This appeared to have cost her, as she fell behind the Dutchwoman at 1,800 m and started to lose more time in the ensuing laps. The gap increased to 2.76 seconds at 3,400 m, but Smit’s final 33 and 34-second laps left room for improvement. Pechstein seized that opportunity, turning around her deficit at the bell to a sizable margin of victory at the finish line.

This was the second time that the team jumping required a jump-off at the Olympics, the first time occurring in 2004. The first three American riders – McLain Ward, Laura Kraut, and Will Simpson – went clear, giving the US a team score of 0.00 for the jump-off. Canada had only three riders, after Mac Cone’s horse Ole was injured and could not compete. When Canadian Jill Henselwood missed an obstacle, the gold medal went to the United States. Canada was led by Ian Millar, who was competing in his ninth Olympics, which tied the Olympic best held by Austrian sailor Hubert Raudaschl. This was Millar’s first medal, and he would return in 2012 and compete at his 10th Olympic Games, a record.
Switzerland won the bronze medal, as noted, but originally Norway had finished ahead of them. However, Norway was disqualified when Tony André Hansen’s horse Camiro tested positive for capsaicin, a topical anti-inflammatory medication often applied to horses’ legs so they do not hurt when they hit obstacles. Without his scores, Norway dropped to eighth place. Germany was also affected by drug controls when Christian Ahlmann’s horse, Cöster, also tested positive for capsaicin. Two years later another German, Marco Kutscher, would be disqualified for a positive doping test in the event, which meant that Germany did not officially have three riders finish the course in either round, although they had originally tied the Netherlands for fourth place.

Pellegrini’s heat swim was a statement of intent and she shaved a tenth off Manadou’s world record in the process. The main challenge to Pellegrini came not from Hoff but from Slovenia’s Sara Isakovič who, earlier in 2008, had won the European title in the absence of the Italian. Pellegrini avoided the tactical mistakes of her 400 freestyle swim and took the lead over the second 50 and, swimming well under world record pace, pulled away from field. She touched the wall in 1:54.82 which was over half a second under her own world record but only just ahead of Isakovič and Pang Jiaying of China both of whom were also well below the previous best time. Pellegrini maintained her place as one of the greatest of freestyle swimmers by repeating the 200/400 double at both the 2009 and 2011 World Championships.

Back in November 2021, in Stavanger (NOR), she had held off Isabelle Weidemann and Ragne Wiklund, two medal contenders. Also considered were world record holder Nataliya Voronina and 10-time world champion, and two-time Olympic champion, Martina Sáblíková.
Voronina was the first to beat seven minutes in the race, but her time of 6:56.99 didn’t show any echoes of her marvelous world record and world title race in 2020 – it would eventually land her in seventh place. Sáblíková, the great Czech champion, had been less successful in recent years, having been plagued by recurring back injuries. In January 2022, she had a serious fall while training in Collalbo (ITA), requiring stitches in her thigh and missing the European Championships. Having just missed out on a medal in the 3,000 m, she delivered a very steady race now, delivering all 32-second (or faster) laps, leading to a 6:50.09 final time.
After a slightly slower start, Weidemann in pair five set out for a pace slightly faster each lap than Sáblíková had been. Wiklund trailed the Canadian closely until about 3,000 m, but she faded quickly while the Weidemann ended in 6:48.18, guaranteeing her second medal of the Games after bronze in the 3,000 m. The other two 3K medalists once again faced-off in the final pair. Again, Francesca Lollobrigida took off quickly, while Schouten started a bit slower than Sáblíková. Before the halfway point, Schouten had passed Lollobrigida as well as Sáblíková’s splits. Racing a “negative split”, she recorded a faster second half of the race, bringing her well below the times of her rivals, finishing in 6:43.51, well below the 2002 Olympic Record.
For Sáblíková, her seventh medal made her the undisputed most successful Olympic athlete for the Czech Republic, beating out Kateřina Neumannová on gold medals won as well as total medals.

He rarely raced over 100 metres or the Imperial equivalent of 110 yards, but he held the American records for both 100 and 150 yards.  The world record at the beginning of 1912 was held by Hungary’s András Baronyi, who had posted 1:18.8 at Budapest on 17 July 1911.

Schiele was in Stockholm and competed in this event, but he was disqualified in heat one of round one.
Fahr’s world record was not threatened in any round.  But the final came down to him and Hebner.  After a false start, Hebner took an early lead and held off Fahr to win by slightly over one second.

Liddell was devoutly religious and when he heard that the 100 final would be held on a Sunday, he withdrew from the 100 metres. But this was fabricated. Liddell knew about the Olympic schedule several months in advance and never intended to run the 100 in Paris. He focused instead on the 200 and 400, adjusting his training for the longer sprints.
Besides Liddell the other favored athlete in Paris in 1924 was the defending champion, Charlie Paddock, of the United States. In the 100 final, Abrahams faced four Americans, Paddock, Jackson Scholz, Loren Murchison, Chet Bowman, and New Zealander, Arthur Porritt. Abrahams won the race, as depicted in the movie, becoming the first European winner of the 100 metres. Scholz won the silver medal with Porritt in third, and Paddock a well-beaten fifth.

Terliuga won pool B, despite winning only two of her four contests, with Bettina Plank (AUT) finishing as runner-up in the group.
Goranova won a close semi-final bout against Plank, building up a lead of 3 yukos, before Plank scored an ippon with 17 seconds left. Another yuko, however, meant that Goranova was a 4-3 winner.

It was renamed right after Sochi, but the format was still the same with one downhill run and one slalom run. Only one World Cup event was held in the ongoing season in Lenzerheide and it was won by Wendy Holdener, followed by Marta Bassino and Ana Bucik. Holdener was also the 2017 World Champion and the Alpine Combined Crystal Globe winner from 2015/16. The Alpine Combined World Cup winner in 2016/17, Ilka Štuhec, did not compete in PyeongChang due to an ACL injury to her left knee that she sustained in October 2017.

In addition to Holdener, Mikaela Shiffrin, Michelle Gisin, runner-up at the 2017 Worlds, and Petra Vlhová were considered medal contenders.
The first phase saw Lindsey Vonn in the lead after the downhill, but she was not considered a medal favorite as she no longer competed or trained for slalom. Following her was Ragnhild Mowinckel in second, but 0.74 seconds behind. From the medal contenders Gisin preformed best, finishing in third place and she was a full 1.21 seconds in front of sixth-placed Shiffrin. Holdener was in 10th, 1.97 seconds behind Gisin, and Vlhová was farther back in 13th. From only 28 starters 22 qualified for the second run and, as in the technical events, they started in reverse order which meant that Vlhová, starting 10th, was the first of the favorites to compete. She had a good run, which would be the second fastest run time, but at the end finished outside the medals in fifth. The fastest run time was set by Holdener and she took the lead until Shiffrin bettered her overall time. With three skiers to go Gisin took advantage of her comfortable lead and easily topped the results. Mowinckel was not able to threaten the top three and placed fourth, while Vonn did not finish the slalom run.
Michelle Gisin became the first ever female Olympic champion in Alpine Combined for Switzerland and followed her sister Dominique, who won gold in downhill four years earlier, to win a second gold medal for the Gisin family. Rossignol, with Gisin, won their second gold at this Games, Shiffrin used Atomic, and Holdener skied Head.

She was heavily favored in Innsbruck. Her biggest challengers were expected to be Soviet Tayana Averina, who had set two world records at the distance, and her teammate, Leah Poulos, who had won the 1974 World Sprints when Young had fallen in one race. Of the favorites, Young was the first to start, in the fifth pair, and she recorded 42.76 to move into the lead ahead of Canada’s Cathy Priestner, who had skated in the pair before her and posted 43.12. Poulos started in the eighth pair, but could not match either time, finishing in 43.21, which would eventually place her fourth. In the next pair, Soviet Vera Krasnova put a scare into Young with a very fast 100 in 10.64, 0.18 ahead of Young’s start, but she could not maintain that pace and would finish fifth. When Averina finished the 12th pairing in 43.17, the medals were set, with Young winning as expected, Priestner getting silver, and Averina the bronze. A few weeks later, Young would win all four races at the 1976 World Sprints.

Morandi was far from the most experienced finalist, however, eclipsed by the qualification of Yordan Yovchev of Bulgaria, who had first appeared at the 1992 Summer Games. Yovchev tied a record set just days earlier by Oksana Chusovitina by competing in his sixth Olympics as a gymnast.

Morandi nearly caught up with him midway through the competition, posting a score of 15.733 and sliding into second place. With only Arthur Zanetti of Brazil left to go, Chen remained in the lead, but was not yet assured of the gold. Zanetti, who had had the highest execution score but qualified in fourth based on a lower difficulty, was the most recent World Championship runner-up and selected a difficulty equal to Chen’s for his final routine. The Brazilian’s routine was excellent and it earned him a total score of 15.900, sufficient to capture the gold and his nation’s first Olympic medal in the sport. Chen settled for silver and Morandi won bronze, his first Olympic medal in three editions of the Games.

Williams managed to hold onto the lead after the second run, although Germany’s Kerstin Szymkowiak moved up to second place with the fastest time in the second run. Hollingsworth moved up to third place, just 0.03 seconds ahead of Anja Huber (GER), but Rudman and Trott were pretty much out of the medals by that time. In the third run Williams extended her lead to 0.52 seconds with the fastest time, with Hollingsworth and Szymkowiak exchanging positions. On the final run, Rudman finally found her form with the fastest time of the run to finish sixth overall. A relatively conservative run by Williams, the fourth fastest of the run, ensured that she would win Britain’s first ever gold medal in skeleton. In winning silver and bronze medals Szymkowiak and Huber won Germany’s first ever Olympic medals in this discipline. Williams won Great Britain’s first individual winter gold medal since Robin Cousins in figure skating in 1980, and the first by a woman since Jeannette Altwegg in figure skating in 1952. Hollingsworth was in second after three runs, but placed only 11th on the final run, dropping her from the medals, and she publicly apologized to her Canadian fans.

This resulted in the full withdrawal of the Indonesian (and North Korean) Olympic team. The remaining 15 teams played in two round-robin pools, with the past two champions - India and Pakistan - emerging as the number one teams. India, however, had to allow two draws against Germany and Spain, while Pakistan won all six matches. Both squads met each other in the decider for the third time in a row. The match was played at a blistering pace, but remained goalless for a long time. Play had to be suspended briefly after a quarrel between some of the players. A penalty corner by India’s Prithipal Singh was illegally stopped by fullback Munir Ahmed Dar, which resulted in a penalty shot. Mohinder Lal converted it, clinching the match for India.

Both skaters had already played a feature role in the 1988 edition. Mey had won the title in Calgary, while Jansen had fallen, distracted by his sister’s death earlier on the day of the race. In the 1992 season, the two had fought out fascinating duels. In the six 500 m World Cup races held before the Olympics, they had finished first and second on all occasions, once even tying for first. Of the remaining races, Mey had won three and Jansen two. In addition, both had bettered the world record during the season. First, Mey had finally bettered his 1988 Olympic time at Davos, only to see it taken away by Jansen a week later, who lowered the mark to 36.41. Behind these two contenders, the Japanese had been most consistently in front, notably Toshiyuki Kuroiwa and Yasunori Miyabe.
Weather conditions were not good, with rain and flaky winds disturbing the competition. The soft ice was also not in favor of heavier skaters, like Jansen or World Sprint Champion Igor Zhelezovsky. Jansen was the first of the favorites to go. With a flaky final curve, he clocked 37.46, just 0.01 below the rink record. It was soon clear this was not good enough for the gold, as Junich Inoue, a completely unknown Japanese skater, beat the time by 2 tenths in the very next pair. Miyabe and Mey then faced eather in pair four. Mey got off to a 9.78 start, well ahead of Miyabe and Inoue’s split. This opener proved decisive, and Mey finished first in 37.14. That time was only to be approached by Kuroiwa, who had a better full lap, but came out 0.04 second short.

If so, the maximum length of the foil blade was 34 inches (86 cm). The target area was the body “within the limits bounded by the collar of the fencing jacket, the median line, the hip, and a line drawn from the hip to the posterior limit of the armpit, around the front of the arm and along the crest of the shoulder to the collar”. The “median line” referred to a vertical line running down the middle of the front of the torso which meant that touches were valid only to the half of the torso on the side of the fencing arm. Touches to the other side of the torso were not valid. Touches to the back were also not valid.
As was common in Europe, the winner of a foil bout was not determined by the number of touches scored but rather based on the evaluation by the judges. They would have been using a head judge and either two or four side judges for each of the bouts. The fencers bouted for four minutes of actual fencing time, switching sides after two. At the end of the bout: “Each judge without consulting his fellow judges shall award 100 points or any part thereof to each contestant at the end of the bout. The score shall be the average of the sum of the points obtained. The award of each judge shall be announced at the end of each bout.” The fencer whose average score was the highest was the winner of the bout. So, no touch counts are shown in the results because they were not used to determine the winners.
This had the largest field of any 1904 fencing event with nine competitors, which required two preliminary pools to advance four fencers to the final round. There were also fencers from four nations – Cuba, Germany, Great Britain, and the United States. Cuba’s Ramón Fonst went undefeated, winning all four of his pool matches and all three bouts in the final, to win the gold medal. Fonst also won gold in St. Louis with the épée, and had won that weapon at the 1900 Olympics in Paris, and in team foil in 1904. Albertson Van Zo Post won the silver medal, one of five fencing medals he won in St. Louis. He would also compete again at the 1912 Olympics for the United States, but won no medals in Stockholm.

Despite a decline in the national game in recent years, 2016 represented Brazil’s best chance of winning that elusive title, particularly with them having home advantage and the likes of world class players Neymar of Barcelona, Lazio midfielder Felipe Anderson, Paris St Germain defender Marquinhos and the rising young stars of the Brazilian game, Gabriel Barbosa and Gabriel Jesus in their squad. The past three winners of the Olympic title had all been from the Americas (Argentina in 2004/ 2008 and Mexico in 2012) and that too was to give the Brazilians a slight edge, but there were a host of teams waiting to spoil their party.
Germany, who also have an impressive World Cup record without winning the Olympic title, were another of the fancied teams in Rio. They qualified after reaching the semi-final of the European Under-21 Championship and coach Horst Hrubesch kept faith in the youngsters that got them to Rio and his side included the Bender twins, Lars and Sven, World Cup winner Matthias Ginter and Arsenal’s Serge Gnabry. Also heading the European challenge was Sweden, winners of their first UEFA Under-21 tournament in 2015. The team they beat on penalties in the final, Portugal, were riding on a wave of national pride their senior team brought to the country by winning the UEFA European Championship in 2016 – their first major international success. Jordan Larsson, the son of former Feyenoord, Celtic and Barcelona forward Henrik Larsson, was pulled out of the Swedish squad just two weeks before the start of the Olympics by the manager of his club side Helsingborgs, because he claimed the club had just one fit striker so they could not afford to let him go to Rio! The Helsingborgs manager was… his father Henrik.
Colombia, with 2014 World Cup star Teo Gutierrez, along with Argentina and the defending champions Mexico, who beat Brazil in the final at London 2012, were all considered to be in with a chance and one could never write off the likes of the 1996 champions Nigeria, who benefited from having Chelsea’s John Obi Mikel in their very young squad. At the start of the Games they had three 19-year-olds, two 18-year-olds and one 17-year old in their squad but, it must be remembered, the great Pelé made his World Cup début at just 17! Argentina won the South American Under-20 tournament to qualify for Rio and their squad contained Atlético Madrid’s Angel Correa and Giovanni Simeone, the tournament’s top scorer with nine goals. He is the son of Atlético Madrid manager and former Argentina international and Olympian Diego Simeone.
The Nigerian squad nearly never made it to Rio. En route, they were stuck in Atlanta, USA, the day before the men’s competition started, with a problem over payment for a flight, and then they had to wait for a replacement plane because the original one was too small to take them down to Manaus for their opening game in the Amazon Rain Forest region. They arrived just hours before the scheduled kick-off. It didn’t do Oghenekaro Etebo any harm as he scored four goals in a 5-4 win over Japan in the first Olympic men’s match to see nine goals scored in it since 1964, when the UAR beat South Korea 10-0. In another high-scoring opener Seung-Woo Ryu scored an hat-trick as South Korea beat Fiji 8-0 in the highest scoring men’s game since the Soviet Union beat Cuba by the same score in 1984.
Brazil were booed off the pitch after their opening match, which saw them held to a goalless draw by 10-man South Africa, and they were jeered by their own fans again in the second game against the débutant outsiders Iraq, as they were held to a goalless draw again. They were in danger of being eliminated and, with it, the chance of that elusive Olympic gold medal, but they eventually gave their fans something to cheer when they beat group leaders Denmark to set up a meeting with their fellow South Americans Colombia in the knockout stage.
In their second group game, Erick Gutiérrez scored four second half goals for the defending champions Mexico, to turn around a 1-0 half-time deficit against Fiji. Sweden, one of the favourites finished bottom of their group but another of the European hopefuls, Portugal, qualified and set up an interesting last-eight clash with Germany. Like Brazil, Germany went into their final group game winless after two draws but that all changed when they beat Fiji 10-0, with Nils Petersen  scoring five goals and Max Meyer bagging a hat-trick. It was the biggest win at the Olympics since that UAR win back in 1964.
At last Neymar got onto the score-sheet as Brazil beat Colombia in an ill-tempered match as they reached the semi-finals, and Germany, like Brazil, moved closer to their first Olympic title with a comfortable 5-0 win over Portugal in the quarters, with Serge Gnabry maintaining his record of scoring in every game. Nigeria reached their third semi-final in seven Olympics, and completing the last four line-up was Honduras, which assured them of their highest ever finish and the hope of their first ever Olympic medal in any sport.
Sadly for the Hondurans their first medal was not to be gold or silver, as there was no stopping the now rampant Brazilians, as Neymar opened the scoring after just 14 seconds of their semi-final encounter. It was the fastest ever Olympic goal, beating by six seconds the one scored by Janine Beckie of Canada in their opening Rio match against Australia two weeks earlier. Neymar scored again in the final minute as they ousted the plucky qualifiers 6-0. Having seen their women qualify for the final the day before, the German men beat Nigeria thanks to an early goal from Lukas Klostermann and an 89th minute a second goal from Nils Petersen as they became the first country to contest both men’s and women’s finals at the same Olympics.
Nigeria won their first medal of the Games by beating Honduras 3-2 in the bronze medal match. At 3-0, thanks to goals from Sadiq Umar (2) and Aminu Umar, it looked all over, but Anthony Lozano pulled one back for Honduras in the 71st minute and Marcelo Pereira headed home a second four minutes form time to make it a nervous final few minutes. The Africans held on, however, for that first medal in Rio and their third football one to go with the gold they won in 1996 and silver in 2008.
The final, played in front of 79,000 fanatical Brazilians in the Maracanã, saw Brazil and Germany dish up a feast of non-stop football, which was a complete contrast to the last time these two teams met in a major competition, the semi-final of the 2014 FIFA World Cup, when Germany won 7-1. By the time Neymar opened the scoring for the hosts in the 27th minute it could well have been Germany who were in the lead as they had hit the woodwork several times. Far from feeling down at conceding, Germany kept coming at Brazil, but had to wait until the 59th minute before Max Meyer broke them down and equalised. It was the first goal Brazil had conceded in 509 minutes of football at these Games. Both sides continued to press for the winning goal in the remainder of the 90 minutes and the period of extra-time that followed but, despite some very tired legs towards the end, it remained 1-1 and it was down to penalties to decide the first men’s Olympic final to go to a shoot-out since Cameroon beat Spain in 2000.
Germany took the first spot-kick and like each of the first eight, was converted. Each side had one kick left before a possible sudden-death but Freiburg striker Nils Petersen saw his kick saved by Wéverton. It was now down to Neymar, the Brazil captain who, along with his team-mates, had been jeered and booed by the home fans after their first two lacklustre performances to become a national hero. That status was achieved by converting that final spot-kick as he gave Brazil their first ever Olympic football gold medal. Of course, Brazil wanted to win as many medals as they could on home soil, but the one medal they desperately wanted more than any other was the elusive football gold, and they got it.

Three of the reigning European champions, Gerd Cintl, Horst Effertz, and Michael Obst, competed in Rome and were joined by Klaus Riekemann and Jürgen Litz. Similarly, three members of Italy’s 1956 Olympic champions, Romano Sgheiz, Franco Trincavelli, and Ivo Stefanoni, were joined by Fulvio Balatti and Giovanni Zucchi. Since 1956, however, the Italians had not appeared on a European Championship podium and no nation other than Germany had won more than one medal of any kind at that tournament. England had won the event at the 1958 British Empire and Commonwealth Games, but only one member of that crew, Simon Crosse, rowed at the 1960 Olympics.
In the opening round, Germany’s stature as the favorites increased as they completed the heats with a time over four seconds faster than their nearest competitor, the Soviet Union. Italy and Germany were the quickest in the semifinals as well, although France, who had not medaled at the Europeans since 1947, was less than a tenth of a second behind Italy’s time, which was made even more surprising by the fact that the nation had only survived the opening round by winning its heat in the repêchage. Its performance in the final was even more astonishing: although they could not quite catch the Germans to win the gold medal, the French crew captured silver by outperforming the defending champion Italians, who in turn settled for bronze.

The 2011 World Champion was Botswana runner Amantle Montsho, the first international-class female runner from that African nation. Defending champion Christine Ohuruogu also qualified for the final and would be cheered on by the British fans. The best time of the year belonged to Russian Antonina Krivoshapka, with 49.16. She posted the fastest semi-final, winning the third heat in 49.81, just ahead of American DeeDee Trotter.
The final saw Krivoshapka take the lead at 100 metres in 11.8, barely up on Richards-Ross. The Russian kept it up through 200 metres, passing that in 23.2, leading Richards-Ross by 0.5 seconds, followed by Trotter, Francena McCorory (USA), and Montsho. But Richards-Ross was running a patient race and reeled in Krivo just past 300 metres to take the lead, with her teammates close behind. Ohuruogu was well back in fifth as they entered the straight. On the homestretch, Richards-Ross maintained her lead, increasing it slightly over Trotter, as Krivoshapka faded, eventually placing sixth. Ohuruogu closed the fastest, but was a metre back of Richards-Ross at the line, with Trotter just edged out for silver, and Montsho barely missing the podium.

The tiebreaker for the Original Program was the Required Elements score, while the tiebreaker for the Free Skating was the Technical Merit score.  Thus, if a pair was ranked first by a majority of the judges, that skater was placed first overall for that section.  Ties were broken by a Subsequent Majority rule. The tiebreakers were then, in order, 1) Number of Majority Placements, 2) Total Ordinals of Majority, 3) Total Ordinals.  Final placement was determined by factored placements.  The placement for the Original Program was factored by 0.5 (33.3%), and the placement for Free Skating was factored by 1.0 (66.7%).  The sums of the factored placements were then used to determine final placement, with the Free Skating being the tiebreaker.",na,"The best pair in the last year had been Canada’s Jamie Salé and David Pelletier. They had won the 2001 World title, and had a nine-event winning streak coming into Salt Lake, including three victories over Yelena Berezhnaya and Anton Sikharulidze, the 1998 silver medalists and World Champions in 1998-99. In the short program, there was little to choose between them until the end, when Salé slipped and fell during their final pose, pulling down her partner with her. Berezhnaya and Sikharulidze were given seven first place votes to two for the Canadians. They skated first in the free program and performed well. But their technical scores of 5.7 and 5.8 gave plenty of room for Salé and Pelletier. The Russians artistic scores were almost all 5.9. Salé and Pelletier performed a flawless routine to the theme from Love Story, and the audience seemed convinced that they were the champions. All their scores, technical and artistic, were 5.8s and 5.9s. But then the score came on the screens, and Berezhnaya and Sikharulidze had won, five first-place votes to four for the Canadians. The Canadian Olympic Association demanded an investigation.
The five judges who voted for the Russians were from Russia, China, Poland, Ukraine, and France. The French judge was Marie-Reine Le Gougne and speculation focused on her. A few days later, it was found that Le Gougne had told British referee Sally-Anne Stapleford that she had been pressured to vote for the Russians, in exchange for Russians judges favoring the French ice dance team. She later retracted this claim but the damage had been done. Four days after the competition ended, IOC President Jacques Rogge held a press conference in conjunction with the International Skating Union (ISU) and announced that it was decided to place both pairs joint first, and award two sets of gold medals. Le Gougne was suspended from figure skating judging for three years. It should be noted that even without Le Gougne’s altered scores, Berezhnaya and Sikharulidze may have won the event, as figure skating experts noted their great speed and higher technical difficulty during the long program.
In July 2002, Uzbeki mafia chieftain Alimzhan Tokhtakhunov was arrested at his home in Italy. He had been investigated by the United States FBI for years for links to drug trafficking and illegal arms sales. Wiretaps had shown he was closely connected to many top Russian athletes, among them Marina Anissina, the Russian-born ice dancer who competed for France, as well as several Russian tennis players. Tokhtakhunov was imprisoned in Italy for a year, but was never extradited to the United States, and eventually returned to Russia. Anissina denied any involvement or knowledge in the schemes connected to the judging scandal.
The scandal led to major changes in the sport of figure skating. The entire judging system, for over a century based on majority placements, was scrapped in favor of a points system, in which skaters accumulated points to determine their final score, rather than starting with a perfect 6.0 and seeing points deducted for errors. The nine judge system was jettisoned in favor of 12 judges, with only nine scores to be selected at random, and the nine selected judges were not revealed. Thus the new system was actually less transparent. What the ISU did not count on was that the scandals, the controversies, the perfect 6.0s, and the old system, was part of the intrigue and interest in figure skating. Since television had discovered figure skating in the 1960s, it had been the perfect winter sport. And with the Hardigan scandal in the 1994 women’s event, figure skating had taken off, and been a boom sport. But after 2002, its popularity dropped precipitously, and many people felt the new scoring system, which nobody could understand or follow, was part of the problem. Through 2020, the sport has not yet really recovered in the United States and Europe, although Asian success has led to the sport becoming very popular there.

She confirmed her status in Sydney, winning the 100 final by an insulting .37 margin over Greece’s Aikaterini Thanou. But the story would not end for several years. In 2000 Jones was married to shot putter C. J. Hunter and during the Sydney Olympics it was revealed that he tested positive for steroids several times earlier in the year. They later divorced, and she then married sprinter Tim Montgomery.
In 2003 Jones was found to have participated with the BALCO Scandal and was banned for two years by the IAAF. In 2006 Jones almost tested positive for the only time in her career, with a sample showing use of eryrthropoietin (EPO) after the US Championships. But her B sample was negative and it was not considered a positive drug test. Shortly thereafter Montgomery was charged in a check-kiting scheme, Jones was implicated as well, and they later divorced. She then married Barbadian sprinter Obadele Thompson, who had, at least, no drug charges against him.
In October 2007, Jones admitted to federal prosecutors that she had lied to them and had used steroids in the months prior to the Sydney Olympics. Her 2000 results were stricken by the IAAF and the medals were returned to the IOC. She was found guilty of lying to federal prosecutors and was sentenced to six months in jail, which she began serving in early 2008.
The disposition of the other medals was not so easy. Thanou was the original silver medalist, and could have been upgraded to a gold medal. However, because of her actions just prior to the 2004 Olympics, when she and Greek sprinter Kostas Kenteris evaded a drug test by faking a motorcycle accident, the IOC did not upgrade Thanou to the gold medal, leaving her with silver. They did upgrade the bronze medalist, Tayna Lawrence, to silver, however, and Merlene Ottey, the original fourth place finisher, to bronze, giving the event no gold medalist but two silver medalists.

The bronze was surprisingly taken by Spain, which had never before made the semi-finals.
The tournament set-up, in which all placements were decided, was apparently disliked by several teams, as Germany, Poland and Denmark did not complete the matches for the places between 5th and 16th. In contrast, Australia played two extra matches. In a match for places 5 through 8, Australia and Kenya were tied after 40 minutes of extra time, when the match had to be suspended because of nightfall. The referee tossed a coin and awarded the match to Australia, which proceeded to win the 5th place game against New Zealand. A Kenyan protest was awarded by the jury of appeal, and a replay was ordered. The Australians won again, but also had to re-play New Zealand, this time losing 0-1.

Gert Fredriksson of Sweden, however, had gained a reputation for his success in smaller European events and was considered the favorite in both this event and the K-1 1000, which he would go on to win the following day. Despite the time that had elapsed, three participants had won medals at the previous Olympics or World Championships: Ernie Riedel of the United States (bronze in the 1936 K-1 10000), Henri Eberhardt of France (silver in the 1936 Folding K-1 10000), and Czesław Sobieraj of Poland (silver in the 1938 K-1 10000). The Swiss entrant, Emil Bottlang, had also competed in the 1936 Folding K-2 10000, although he had not won a medal.
Due to the fact that the Henley could only accommodate a limited number of boats, and the International Canoe Federation forbade heats in races of this distance, the competitors began at intervals of 30 seconds. According to the Official Report, “[t]his decision, although inevitable, was not popular, since it is impossible for a competitor to judge his position relative to the others, and he is forced to race to the clock, an extremely difficult technique.”  Fredriksson was the star of the event and won a well-deserved gold medal, and he was followed across the finish line by Finland’s Kurt Wires and Norway’s Eivind Skabo, who took silver and bronze respectively. Wires collapsed upon completion of the event and was not made aware of his second-place finish (due to the staggered start) until he was revived by Denmark’s Knud Ditlevsen, who came in fourth.

Lööf and Ekström had a disastrous day in the medal race, placing last of the 10th crews, and dropping back into a tie with Brazil for second place. Percy and Simpson placed only fifth in the medal race but it was enough to bring them the gold medal. Percy had won Olympic gold in the Finn class back in 2000, and was the 2002 Star World Champion. He and Simpson would return in 2012 and add a silver medal in this class.
Brazil won the silver medal, based on having placed ahead of Sweden in the medal race. This was Scheidt’s fourth consecutive Olympic medal, having won gold in the Laser in 1996 and 2004, and silver in 2000. Prior to 2008 only two Olympic sailors (Paul Elvstrøm of Denmark and Valentyn Mankin of the Soviet Union) had won four consecutive medals, but four sailors would match this feat at Qingdao.
In 2012 it came to light that Peter O’Leary, Irish sailor who finished in 13th in this event, had actually bet 300 Euros on Great Britain to win the gold medal, eventually winning 3,600 Euros at 12-1 odds. He was given a warning by the IOC for violating their rules on betting on Olympic events, but no further sanction was given because his bet did not affect the outcome of the event.

The big question of the 2002 Olympic luge doubles concerned whether the home track advantage of the American pairs would be enough to topple the Europeans and earn a first US Olympic gold in the sport. The answer was to be no but the margin of victory for the German pair of Alexander Resch and Patric Leitner was small.
Resch and Leitner, the 2004 world champions, set the best time of the first run with Clay Ives and Chris Thorpe leading US teammates, the Mark Grimmette / Brian Martin combination, for second and third. The Americans were both faster than the German leaders over the final run but not by enough to overhaul them for the gold medal. Grimmette and Martin were fast enough to put themselves ahead of their compatriots and into the silver medal position.

His semi-final win over Frenchman Alexis Vastine was controversial as Vastine was twice penalized for holding, which gave the bout to Díaz, 12-10. After the semi-finals, AIBA delegate Rudel Obreja held a press conference in which he alleged that there was bias in the selection of referees.

A good example of this is the boxer Ted Morgan. Although he had been born in England, his family had emigrated to New Zealand when he was a baby and had never left his adopted country since. On the long boat journey to Europe a lack of exercise meant that he gained enough weight to force him to move from the lightweight division, in which he was national champion, to the welterweights. Arriving in England, where the New Zealanders had based their training camp, he suffered a potentially serious setback when sparring with English professional Ernie Rice. His left hand smacked into Rice’s elbow and he suffered a dislocated knuckle. Although treatment by Arthur Porritt, the former New Zealand sprinter and 100 m bronze medalist in Paris, mitigated the effects of the injury he was unable to use his left hand to full effectiveness throughout the tournament.
Despite his injury, he dispatched Johansson of Sweden via a second round knockout in his first contest; he also outpointed French and Italian opponents on his way to the final. Morgan’s opponent for the gold was Raúl Landini, an Argentinean noted for his ability to knock out opponents. The New Zealander never allowed his opponent enough room to tee off his punches and comfortably outboxed Landini to claim the decision. Morgan had other reasons to remember his Olympic adventure, a shipboard romance with fellow New Zealand competitor Norma Wilson led to one of the first marriages between Olympians.
The American entrant in this division was New York’s Tommy Lown. Lown was noted for singing “Mother Macree”, a popular song of the time, after winning his contests. In Amsterdam he lost his first bout and remained silent.

Other athletes who qualified were the winner of the 2015 UIPM World Cup final plus the top three finishers at the World Championships in Berlin.

At first it was moved to Friday, but the Super G was scheduled for that day, and the IOC preferred not to postpone races from the original schedule, so the super combined, which differs from the former combined event as only one slalom heat is raced, was contested on Sunday, 21 February.
The favorites were Aksel Lund Svindal, after gold in the Super G and silver in the downhill, he was also the reigning world champion in super combined, and Bode Miller, after a silver in the Super G and bronze in the downhill, and having won the World Cup super combined at Wengen earlier in the winter. Ivica Kostelić, who finished the downhill event on Monday in 18th place, and Benjamin Raich were also considered challengers. Kostelić won silver at Torino in 2006, had finished third in the 2009-10 World Cup super combined, which finished before Vancouver, and had won the last combined event at Kitzbühel about one month prior to the Games. Raich had already won the 2009-10 World Cup in the event and had one win at Val d’Isère. The first of the four combined events held in the seasonal World Cup was won by Carlo Janka at Beaver Creek. Janka had also won the combined World Cup in 2008-09 and placed second in 2009-10. Silvan Zurbriggen, second in the 2008-09 combined World Cup, and Ted Ligety, gold medalist from Torino, were also given a shot. The 2006 bronze medalist Rainer Schönfelder (ACL tear) as well as 2007 World Champion Daniel Albrecht, who had crashed horrifically in the downhill at Kitzbühel in January 2009, failed to compete in Vancouver.
The downhill saw Aksel Lund Svindal leading with 1:53.15, 0.39 seconds ahead of Dominik Paris and 0.50 seconds ahead of Carlo Janka. Ted Ligety, who finished 15th in the downhill section, set the standard in what would be the fastest slalom time, resulting in a combined time of 2:45.82. His lead held until Ivica Kostelić, starting with a 0.86 second advantage ahead of Ligety, raced to a combined time of 2:45.20 on the slalom course designed by his father. Starting two skiers later, Bode Miller skied an almost perfect slalom to take over the lead by 0.33 seconds ahead of Kostelić. Silvan Zurbrigen, skiing next, posted a combined time of 2:45.32 to put him into the bronze medal position. The final four skiers were, arguably, more downhill specialists, and had big leads over Miller after the downhill section. The first of the four, downhill gold medallist Didier Défago went out after missing a gate. Janka threatened for a while, but his time of 2:45.54 finished just outside the medals. The final two skiers, Paris and Svindal, both missed gates and failed to finish, so Bode Miller won his first Olympic gold medal at his third Games. With Miller Head won its third gold medal (and eighth in total) at this Games, while Kostelić won the first medal for Fischer with silver and Zurbriggen won bronze for Rossignol.

Seto was coming off a six-month suspension in 2020 by the Japanese Swimming Federation for an ethics violation, having admitted to an extramarital affair. Seto’s biggest challenger was expected to be American Chase Kalisz, the silver medallist at both the 2016 Olympics and the 2019 World Championships. Kalisz had won the US Olympic Trials in 4:09.09, close behind’s Seto’s best 2021 mark.
Seto versus Kalisz never materialized as Seto shockingly finished ninth in the preliminaries and did not make the final. The prelims were led by Australian Brendon Smith with New Zealander Lewis Clareburt second, followed by Kalisz. Kalisz would lead most of the final, taking over on the second leg, the butterfly, although Clareburt took a brief lead at the end of the butterfly. Kalisz regained the lead on breaststroke and held it to win comfortably by almost a second. Behind him, his teammate Jay Litherland surprised by coming in for silver, despite having been fourth for most of the splits. Brendon Smith had likewise trailed badly most of the race but had the fastest finish and garnered the bronze medal, as Clareburt struggled in the freestyle, eventually finishing seventh.

Bullish reports from the British camp had even suggested that they were producing practice times that were under their existing world record in the weeks before the Games began. The Aussies had been the most consistent team since the London Games, but Great Britain had recently regained the services of Bradley Wiggins since his retirement from road cycling. The British were the penultimate starters in the qualifying round and they immediately threw down a challenge to the rest of the world by posting a time only marginally outside their own world record. Up next were the Australians who could not match the British time and only narrowly avoided having to meet them in the semi-final.
The semi-finals were contrasting affairs.  Great Britain set a world record in their crushing victory over New Zealand in the first, but the second was a classic. Denmark and Australia traded the lead over the course of the race and there was only a tenth of a second in favour of the Aussies when they crossed the line for the final time.
Having been three seconds slower than the British in their previous rides, Australia decided to gamble in the final and set off at a speed they had not approached previously. For 3.5 km they led but the effort proved just a little too much for them and they faded over the last two laps. Even then there was nearly a final sting in the tail. With both teams reduced to three riders on the final lap the British began to drop their final counting rider. A huge effort brought him back to the other pair and it was enough to shave another three tenths of a second off the world record. Australia’s time would have been the world record at the start of the day. Denmark, meanwhile, had little trouble defeating New Zealand for the bronze medal. For Bradley Wiggins this was his eighth Olympic medal over the course of five Olympic Games, a British record, and fifth Olympic title. Another member of the GBR team, Ed Clancy, became the most successful rider in the history of the event on winning his third successive gold.

Kelly had also been the runner-up in 1946, while Séphériadès was the 1947 European Champion. Wood, meanwhile, had represented his nation in the coxed eights at the 1936 Games. Another notable competitor was Hans Jakob Keller of Switzerland, the 1947 European bronze medalist.
Width restrictions at Henley meant that only three boats could compete at one time. When the waves had calmed after the round one repêchage, the only surprising absentee was Keller; all the other major contenders had advanced with ease. The three-boat limit meant that only the medalists would advance to the final, and Séphériadès had the misfortune of being placed in Wood’s head, where he was defeated handily. More surprising was Eduardo Risso of Uruguay’s victory in the semi-finals, since he edged out Kelly by 0.4 seconds after coming up dramatically from behind (Kelly’s time, however, would not have been sufficient to best any of the semi-final winners). Taking the first semi-final heat was the equally-unheralded Romolo Catasta of Italy, who recorded the fastest time of the round and finished ahead of Argentina’s Tranquilo Capozzo (who would earn a gold medal in the double sculls in 1952) by over seven seconds.  The final, meanwhile, was no contest: Wood finished nearly 14 seconds ahead of Risso, who in turn was over 13 seconds ahead of Catasta. Risso’s silver was an improvement on Uruguay’s previous best rowing result at the Olympics; Guillermo Douglas had won bronze in the single sculls in 1932.

Since then, however, they had only managed bronze at the 2015 World Championships and silver at the 2013 European Championships (Germany had also won silver in 2016, but with a different crew). They were therefore prime targets for the new Hungarian duo of Gabriella Szabó and Danuta Kozák who, together, possessed 32 Olympic, World, and European Championship titles. Most recently, they had been the 2014 and 2015 World Champions and the 2014 and 2016 European Champions. While these two nations were the strong favorites for gold, Poland’s Karolina Naja and Beata Mikołajczyk were contenders for the final podium spot.

The reigning World Champions, they had a strong showing in the pre-season, winning two of the three World Cup races, while placing second to Russian in the third. Not only did the Canadians have several star skaters, they had also trained exhaustively for the event, still relatively new. But the competition delivered surprise after surprise.
First, the strong Russian team suffered a shock quarter-final defeat at the hands of Poland, after one of the Russians fell behind in the later stages of the race. Then, it was the unheralded Americans who silenced the Canadian crowd by beating the favorites. Canada had been leading with ease, but had not paid attention to the splits of their opponents, and had failed to accelerate.
The second semi-final provided even more excitement. Defending champion Germany was facing the Americans, and they had a solid lead for most of the race. But their star skater, Anni Friesinger-Postma, who had almost been left out of the team due to poor shape caused by injury, struggled in the final lap. While trying to close the gap with ther team mates, Friesinger fell in sight of the finish line. With swimming motions and by turning her skates towards the line, the Germans nevertheless managed to finish ahead of the Americans.
In the final, Germany faced Japan, which had reached the final with relative ease. The Japanese opened up a large lead over the Germans, who raced without Friesinger. But the three Asians totally collapsed in the final lap, resulting in a photo finish. Germany came out the winners, with just 0.02 separating gold and silver. The bronze medal race was also remarkable. The Americans brought in Catherine Raney-Norman, which eventually cost them the bronze. She couldn’t follow the pace of the Americans, who were leading up to that point. The Polish team, of which even the best skater (Katarzyna Bachleda-Curuś) rarely featured in the top-10 of international competitions, thus won a completely unexpected bronze medal. It was the first bronze medal since 1960, when Poland had claimed two medals in the sport’s début for women.

Turner was furious, claiming the referees had been after her following her alleged misbehaviour in the 500 m final.
Turner’s exit still left most of the favourites in contention. World Champion and World Record holder Nathalie Lambert qualified for the final, as did 500 m silver medallist Zhang. Two South Koreans made it to the last round: Jeon I-Gyeong, runner-up at the 1993 World Championships, and Kim So-Hui.

72274,"Single Sticks, Individual, Men",1904 Summer Olympics,3,Fencing,/editions/3/sports/FEN, 8 September 1904,"Physical Culture Gymnasium, Washington University, St. Louis",3 from 1 countries,na,na,"Single stick fencing was a form of fencing using either a single wooden stick or similar to sabre but with a wooden stick replacing the metal blade. Instead of a metal guard to protect the hand, a wicker basket or thick leather guard was usually used. The single stick was used initially as a way to train fencers using equipment that was less expensive and less subject to breakage but evolved into a competitive event.
As sword fighting on the battlefield became rare, soldiers in the Army were taught foil fencing because they were only likely to need to know sword fighting for formal duels. Sailors in the Navy were taught sabre fencing because they were likely to need sword fighting when boarding enemy ships where sabre techniques would be more beneficial. Sabres made out of metal, though, were expensive and prone to breakage because of the state of metallurgy at that time and so fencing techniques were usually taught using single sticks. By the early 1900s, the boarding of ships and hand-to-hand combat were no longer being done and so single stick fencing ceased being practiced. Single sticks was only contested at the Olympics in 1904. There were only three competitors and it was won easily by Albertson Van Zo Post who scored 11 touches against 8 by the runner-up, William Scott O’Connor.

In June he entered the Finnish Olympic trial, but announced to the official he would stop at around 40 km., because of an Achilles’ tendon problem. His time to there was just over 2-22, equivalent to about a 2-29 marathon, which would have won the race by six minutes. Nurmi made the trip to Los Angeles but did not run the Olympic marathon. Three days before the Olympics began, the IAAF suspended him for having accepted excessive expense money during some of his tours. He was declared a professional and was not allowed to compete in the Olympics.
The 1932 Olympic marathon course started and finished at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, but was a loop course around Los Angeles. The best known runners in the race were two Britons, Sam Ferris and Duncan McLeod Wright. Also highly considered was the winner of the Finnish trial, Armas Toivonen. The Americans had no top contender but interestingly, an Argentine, Juan Carlos Zabala, had run in two of the American trial races, having come to the United States to acclimate himself. In the race, a stretched-out pack of five led thru 24 miles, which included Zabala, Ferris, Wright, Toivonen, and Japan’s Seiichiro Tsuda. Zabala took the lead but was struggling. Ferris, in fourth, was the freshest and closed quickly as they neared the stadium. But he had not started his surge soon enough, and Zabala won on the track by 19 seconds, with Ferris second, and Toivonen third. Zabala attempted two more marathons in his career, but never again finished the race.

Ties broken by lightest bodyweight.,na,"The 1985-86 World Champion was Bulgarian Naum Shalamanov, who was actually born Naim Suleimanov. Suleimanov was a prodigy who began setting world records at age 15, and when only 16-years-old he became the second lifter to lift three times his body weight in the clean & jerk. He had Turkish ethnicity and was approached by Turkish lifting officials to change his nationality and compete for their country, but he refused. In 1984-85 the Bulgarian government began a crackdown on Turkish minorities and when Suleimanov returned from a training camp in Australia, his passport was conviscated and his name was changed to the more Bulgarian sounding Naum Shalamanov. This was the impetus he needed and at the 1986 World Cup competition in Melbourne, he left his team and sought asylum at the Turkish consulate. He then chose the Turkish name of Naim Süleymanoğlu.
Olympic rules require an athlete to wait three years after changing nationality before representing the new nation at the Olympics, unless the two affected nations agree on a waiver. This waiver was “given” in the form of over $1 million (US) transferred from the Turkish government to allow Süleymanoğlu to compete as a Turk at the 1988 Olympics. He came to Seoul as an overwhelming favorite in the featherweight class.
Süleymanoğlu did not disappoint his new nation, winning the gold medal by 30 kg over Bulgaria’s Stefan Topurov, who had won the 1987 World Championships when Süleymanoğlu was not yet eligible to compete. In Seoul Süleymanoğlu broke the world record in the snatch, the clean & jerk, and the total, lifting 342.5 kg, which also would have won the lightweight class, and was a remarkable 55 kg ahead of the bronze medalist, China’s He Yuanming. His total in Seoul is the highest total ever lifted using Sinclair Coefficients, which compares lifters of differing weights, and remained a world record until the weight classes were changed. He would return to win the gold medal at Barcelona in 1992 and Atlanta in 1996. During his career he won three Olympic Championships, seven overall World Championships, two overall European Championships, and set 46 world records. Through 2012 he remains the only lifter to snatch 2½ times his bodyweight, and he is usually considered the strongest lifter ever, pound-for-pound.

After three events, the totals were re-scored counting the marks among only the 12 qualifiers for the final two events. Ties were broken using the decathlon scoring tables.",na,"At the eastern U.S. Olympic Trials on 18 May 1912, held in New York, Jim Thorpe won easily, setting what is considered the first world record in the pentathlon with 3,656.980 points (3,372 on the 1985 tables).  He was considered the American favorite in the Olympic pentathlon, but it was difficult to handicap the field as the event had never been contested internationally.
Thorpe solved the problem rather simply by winning four of the five events contested.  Only in the javelin throw was he beaten by any athlete, as both Sweden’s Hugo Wieslander and Oscar Lemming posted longer javelin throws.  Thorpe’s dominance was almost complete.  Using 1912 scoring tables, his margin of victory was over 400 points.
But as in the decathlon, Jim Thorpe only kept his pentathlon gold medal until early 1913 when he was disqualified for professionalism.  The gold medal reverted to Norway’s Ferdinand Bie.  For a complete description of the Thorpe controversy, see his bio on Olympedia.  Thorpe has also been awarded the Challenge Trophy for the pentathlon, which had been donated by the King of Sweden.
In 1982, after research by Bob Wheeler and Florence Ridlon, it was discovered that Thorpe’s medals should not have been removed, as any dispute as to eligibility had to have been made within 30 days after the end of the 1912 Olympics, but his medals were removed about 6 months later. The IOC restored Thorpe as the gold medalist but he was listed as the co-gold medalist with Ferdinand Bie in the pentathlon and with Hugo Wieslander in the decathlon.
Finally, in 2022, the IOC restored Thorpe as the sole gold medalist and would now list Bie and Wieslander as co-silver medalists. The official announcement from the IOC on 15 July 2022 was as follows: “On 15 July 2022, on the day of the 110th anniversary of Thorpe’s medal in decathlon, the IOC announced its decision to display the name of Jim Thorpe as the sole gold medallist in pentathlon and decathlon at the Olympic Games Stockholm 1912. The IOC explained in its communication that this development was possible after the engagement of the Bright Path Strong organisation, supported by IOC Member Anita DeFrantz, who had contacted the Swedish Olympic Committee (SOC) and the surviving family members of Hugo K. Wieslander, who had been named as the gold medallist in decathlon when Thorpe was stripped of his medals in 1913. The family had confirmed that Wieslander himself had never accepted the Olympic gold medal allocated to him, and had always been of the opinion that Jim Thorpe was the sole legitimate Olympic gold medallist. The same declaration was received from the Norwegian Olympic and Paralympic Committee and Confederation of Sports, whose athlete, Ferdinand Bie, was named as the gold medallist when Thorpe was stripped of the pentathlon title.”

In the first run of the final, the three leaders were all Chinese, with Li in second place, behind Guo Xinxin leading, and the 1998 Olympic silver medalist, Xu Nannan, in third. Camplin was in fourth, and Leu fifth, while Cooper could not repeat her qualifying success, and would eventually place eighth, falling on both of her jumps. In the second round, Leu had by far the best run, with her back full-full-full, and moved up to win the gold medal. Li held onto second place, while Camplin moved up to a bronze medal, with Xu dropping down to fourth. In 2007, Cooper would return to win her fourth World Cup title, the most ever by a freestyle aerials skier.

For Kaiser Grenoble would be a horrible Olympic experience. Even a bigger favorite in the 3,000, she would also win bronze in that event, and left France with no gold medals. She would return to the Olympics in 1972 and win a gold in the 3,000 and silver in the 1,500. Geijssen had won the 1966 Dutch All-Around, but usually finished behind her teammate.

There was enough interest that odds were published the morning of the race with Edmond Jacquelin and Harry Meijers favored at 2-1, followed by Anton Huber at 4-1, and Tom Cooper and Charles van den Born at 6-1.
The large field required seven rounds of competition, with 12 heats in round one, all with four or five riders. There were eight heats in the quarter-finals with the winner of each heat advancing to the semis. All other riders went through a series of repêchages, with only the winner of the repêchage, Paul Bourrillon, advancing to the semi-finals.
The first semi-final matched Jacquelin against top American Floyd McFarland, but he was no match for Jacquelin who advanced to the final. Semi-final two saw favored Harry Meijers easily ride off Bourrillon. The final semi-final saw an upset as American Tom Cooper defeated Charles van den Born by ½ length in the sprint. In the final, Cooper led at the strategic run-up to the final sprint, but Meijers shot by him as they started the sprint. Jacquelin chased but could not get by Cooper and Meijers won comfortably. Jacquelin said after the race, that because of the wind he had chosen to change his transmission from 8 to 7½, which was the reason he did not win.

The winning team consisted entirely of Scots, including father Willie Jackson and his son Laurence. Willie, the team’s skip, later became the president of the RCCC.
The 1924 curling competition has probably one of the highest average competitor ages of all events in Olympic history. The youngest known competitor is Laurence Jackson, who was 23, but most of the players were over the age of forty. Ödlund’s teammate Carl August Kronlund was the oldest in competition, with 58.
Although the Swedes only played two matches, eight players competed, with only a completely different team in both matches. One of the Swedes, Johan Petter Åhlén, was an accomplished businessman. Starting out with a small-town mail-order business, he eventually founded a department store chain and a publishing house, both bearing his name to this day.
A few days after their victory, the Olympic champions played a friendly match against a team of American jockeys engaged in the annual Sankt Moritz winter horse race meetings and were shockingly defeated by the novice team which included Epsom Derby winners Frank O’Neill and Matt McGee. It was not until after the British team had paid their forfeit of a lavish dinner for the winning team that McGee revealed the secret of the American success – he has surreptitiously coated the underneath of their opponents’ stones with a “good and plenty” amount of glue.

Éva Székely set the pace in the final but her butterfly technique soon faltered and the duo of Van Vliet and Novák moved away from the rest of the field. The race developed into a duel between the two and it was not until the final length that van Vliet moved clear of her rival. In third place at the start of the final 50m was Lyons.

Her closest challenger was probably her compatriot Deng Linlin, 2009 World Champion and runner-up at both the 2010 World Championships and the 2010 Asian Games. The reigning European Champion was Cătălina Ponor of Romania, who had also won the title from 2004 through 2006 and was a three time Olympic gold medalist from the 2004 Games (including the balance beam). Her compatriot Larisa Iordache was also a contender, having come in second at the most recent European Championships. Many eyes were also on the Americans as potential podium finishers, after they had won gold and silver at the 2008 Olympics.
Sui finished first in the qualifying rounds, bolstering her status as a favorite to win the gold medal. Viktoriya Komova of Russia, the reigning World and European Champion in the uneven bars, finished a surprising second in the event, tied in score with American Gabby Douglas. Deng finished in fourth, Ponor in seventh, and Iordache in eleventh, but Diana Boulimar, who finished eighth, fell from the beam and injured herself, which gave her spot to team reserve Iordache. In the final Sui went first and set the bar with a score of 15.500 after an excellent routine of high difficulty. Ponor went next and finished nearly half a point behind, after several mistakes, at 15.066. After a fantastic routine by Deng, with an even higher difficulty than Sui’s, the reigning World Champion was bumped down on the podium and it seemed as if Ponor was all but out of medal contention. After falls from Iordache, Douglas, Komova, and a low-difficulty routine from Kseniya Afanasyeva of Russia, however, Ponor remained in third place with only one gymnast remaining, Aly Raisman of the United States. Raisman completed her routine and initially received a score of 14.966, just below Ponor. Her coach appealed the difficulty score of 6.200, however, which seemed far too low for what she had performed. He was successful in this attempt, raising the difficulty by 0.1, which was sufficient to tie her with Ponor. By virtue of Raisman’s superior execution points, the appeal gave her the final podium spot, ending a gymnastics event in somewhat controversial circumstances for the second time in the Games. Earlier, in the men’s team all-around, a similar last minute appeal lowered the penalty for an error committed by Japan’s Kohei Uchimura, which raised his nation’s standing from fourth to second place.

Nikita Nagorny of the ROC was hoping to add a third medal to go with his team gold, and individual all-round bronze.
The pace was set by Nagorny, who was second man on the bar, and his 14.533 was going to be a challenging score. It was not until the sixth gymnast, Tin Srbić of Croatia, that anybody came close to Nagorny’s mark, and the Croat surpassed it with a 14.900.

As the Norwegians had hoped for, Kolterud was able to advance to 4th place, beating the best non-Norwegian Sven Eriksson (later Selånger) clearly. Kuriyagawa turned out to be a decent jumper, but a fall in the first round relegated him to 20th place, and his countryman Tsukokawa had the shortest jumps of the day and placed 15th overall.

The only top runner missing in Moskva was American Don Paige, who would have challenged in both the 800 and 1,500. Coe was the world record holder, having recorded 1:42.4 in Oslo at the 1979 Bislett Games. He had also broken the 1,500 and mile world record in 1979, but in 1980, Ovett bettered both those marks prior to the Olympics. Coe was a slight favorite with Ovett considered better over the longer distance. The pace was very slow in the final, led by Brazil’s Agberto Guimarães on the first lap. Soviet Nikolay Kirov then took the lead thru 600 metres when Ovett moved up on the final curve. He had the lead at the start of the stretch, with Coe far back and unable to make up enough ground, although he closed quickly to get the silver medal.

In his absence the medal race in middleweight was wide-open, but the Soviet chosen, Viktor Kurentsov, had recently set a world total record.

China had already won the first three men’s events in Tokyo and, as only four athletes per gender were allowed to compete, this was the last men’s event with a Chinese athlete entered and it was ex Olympic champion Lu Xiaojun. He had won gold in 2012 and silver in 2016, when beaten only by bodyweight in the 77 kg class. Lu, the winner of many titles, was the back-to-back world champion, winning at the last two editions in 2018 and 2019. He was also the reigning Asian champion, winning the title in April 2021, and was also the world record holder in clean & jerk (207 kg) and total (378 kg). His strongest opponent was his compatriot Li Dayin, who was almost 15 years younger. Li was the Asian champion in 2019 and World Championship runner-up in 2019 and was also the world record holder in snatch (175 kg), set at the last Asian Championships. Due to the one athlete per nation rule, however, Li did not compete in Tokyo, and it was Lu who was selected. The challengers to Lu for gold were Antonino Pizzolato, season best 370 kg, and winner of the last two European championships, Brayan Rodallegas, season best 363 kg and winner of the last two Pan American championships, Zacarías Bonnat, season best 360 kg and second at the last two Pan American championships, and Rejepbaý Rejepow with a qualification best of 363 kg.
After the snatch element, Lu led with 170 kg followed by Pizzolato (165 kg) and Rejepow (164 kg), who both failed to improve their results when they failed their last lifts. As Rodallegas also failed with his last attempt, he finished fourth together with Bonnat and Ritvars Suharevs who all lifted 163 kg. Lu started the clean & jerk element with a solid 197 kg lift, Bonnet followed with a 198 kg, and Pizzolato and Harrison Maurus both lifted 200 kg. Rodallegas missed his last attempt over 200 kg, which left him without a medal. Bonnat was able to clear 202 kg and then 204 kg, which gave him 367 kg in total and brought him to second place. Lu had previously also cleared 204 kg for a clear lead. When Maurus failed to lift 205 kg in his last attempt the bronze medal was already secured by Pizzolato, so he tried to go for gold with the new world record weight of 210 kg, but he did not make it. Lu also tried this weight, but also failed.
The Olympic Standard for Olympic records was 168 kg for snatch, 201 kg for clean & jerk, and 365 kg for total. Lu set the only Olympic record in snatch with 170 kg, while in clean & jerk Bonnat first set the Olympic record with 202 kg, for it only to be bettered by Lu with 204 kg. New in total Olympic records were set by Lu with 367 kg and 374 kg.
Lu became the first Chinese weightlifter to win three Olympic medals and also became the oldest ever Olympic weightlifting gold medallist at 37 years 4 days. He was almost a year older than Rudolf Plyukfelder, who won gold back in 1964. With the fourth gold medal for the Chinese men’s weightlifting team they finished unbeaten in Tokyo. This was the first time that a men’s weightlifting team had won four gold medals since 2008, when it was also China, but with six lifters competing. The last time a men’s weightlifting team won more gold medals was in 1992 when the Unified Team won five golds, with ten starters. Also competing in Tokyo was Amur Al-Kanjari who got a Tripartite Commission Invitation to become the first Olympic weightlifter representing Oman.

The course was noted to be almost ridiculously difficult and it cost the lives of two horses. In addition, the Roma organizers did not provide adequate veterinary care. The Danish horse Rolf II was badly injured and bleeding. Rolf II had been trapped after a fall in a ditch, and was rescued by Italian Piero D’Inzeo, who was not competing in the event, but D’Inzeo sent for ropes and a block and tackle to pull the horse from the ditch, taking ½-an-hour to remove him. He lay bleeding for almost 2½ hours before a veterinarian appeared to help him. His rider, Poul Erik Bæk, tenderly placed the horse’s head on his saddle, and he and spectators covered Rolf II with a blanket and gave him ice cubes while they waited.
This was better than what happened to the Romanian horse Mures II, who somehow finished the course despite a fatal injury, dying shortly after he crossed the line, but the OCOG did not have this contingency planned for and Mures II lay there for hours before he was removed.
In this setting the results of the competition become secondary. It was won by Australia’s Lawrence Morgan, with the silver going to his teammate Neale Lavis.

Baker was trained at the Kodokan, the world’s oldest and most prestigious Dojo (judo school). In his first three matches in Rio, he defeated his respective opponents by an Ippon (full point) after approximately two minutes of each contest. In the semi-final, it took him 4:40 min to apply a Kesa-gatame (scarf hold) for an Ippon to beat Cheng. In the final, however, he fought very defensively after scoring a Yuko (advantage) after 2:17 min. To the displeasure of the crowd, Baker carefully held on to this minimal lead although he conceded two penalties for defensive posture. The desperate Lip’art’eliani, however, also failed to score, and thus the Georgian had to settle for silver.
Korea’s reigning World Champion Gwak lost his semi-final against Lip’art’eliani but at least claimed bronze, along with China’s Cheng. Refugee Olympic Athlete Popole Misenga, who defected from the Democratic Republic of Congo, gave a good performance.

Soryan was a five-time World Champion (2005-2007, 2009-2010) and a strong prospect to win Iran’s first Olympic gold medal in Greco-Roman wrestling. He had taken the past season off, however, allowing Bayramov to claim the title of reigning World Champion. Both were veterans of the 2008 Games, but had never met at the Olympics, as Soryan was defeated by eventual gold medalist Nazyr Mankiyev in the quarterfinals. Bayramov had survived to the final match, although he too was outclassed by Mankiyev and forced to settle for silver.  With Mankiyev having bowed out of defending his crown, the opportunity was ripe for either wrestler to capture the crown.
Up through the final, Bayramov never suffered a single point in his matches, making him appear to be the strongest contender for gold. Soryan struggled somewhat against his first opponent, Arsen Eraliyev of Kyrgyzstan, but managed to avoid taking any more points in the quarter or semi-finals. The first period of the final went scoreless for 90 seconds, necessitating a par terre finish where Soryan was able to score for two points. In the second period, Soryan converted one of Bayramov’s attacks into a point advantage, which was all he needed to claim his nation’s first Olympic Greco-Roman crown.
In the first bronze medal match, Hungarian Péter Módos defeated Denmark’s Håkan Nyblom in three periods. Each round went to par terre and, although the Dane successfully defended in the first period, he was penalized for a leg grab and lost the round 0-3. Módos was unable to defend when on the bottom, giving the second round to Nyblom and extending the match to a third period. Scoreless at the end of 90 seconds, and with their points and cautions tied, a ball was drawn to determine which competitor would choose the positions in the final par terre. Módos won and chose to be on top, successfully scoring on Nyblom and earning the podium spot. The second bout, between Mingiyan Semyonov of Russia and Choi Gyu-Jin of South Korea, was more straightforward but far more aggressive. After a heated exchange in the first period, which Semyonov won 3-1, the Russian clenched the bronze medal by successfully defending in the second period’s par terre.

After trying ice speed skating for the first time in 2016, she seriously converted the following year. After only a few months in the sport, she qualified for the 2018 Olympics, where she finished in 24th place in the 500 m.
At the 2019 Worlds, she improved to 15th and then was seventh at the 2020 edition. Choosing not to attend the “COVID bubble” of Heerenveen in 2021, she emerged as one of the surprises when the World Cups resumed with a full field in the 2021/22 season. She won the first three World Cup races of the season, adding a fourth in Salt Lake City, as well as two more podium finishes.
These performances made Jackson one of the pre-Games favorites, but she still had to place among the top two at the US Olympic Trials. Midway through her race, she had an unusual miss-stroke, briefly losing pace and finishing in third. Normally, this would have cost her a spot at the Olympic Games, but teammate Brittany Bowe, who had won the trial race, decided to give up her spot. Long-time friend Bowe, like Jackson, hailed from the Florida town of Ocala, and both had learned inline speed skating there as children.
Although Bowe’s gesture ultimately had no effect on herself (she was allowed to skate the 500 m after the US was granted a third quota spot), the action was widely praised, including naturally by Jackson herself.
In Beijing, Jackson produced a fitting conclusion to her journey. Racing in the penultimate pair, she clocked 37.04, good enough for a gold medal. This made her the first female Black skater to become Olympic champion, and only the second Black skater after Shani Davis. Joining her on the podium were the surprising Miho Takagi, who had earlier won silver in the 1,500 m, and 2021 World Champion Angelina Golikova. Plagued by back injuries earlier in the season, 2019 World Champion Vanessa Herzog recorded a second consecutive fourth place.

Paul Manning had retired from competition to coach and Bradley Wiggins had saved his strength to train for other events, so they were replaced by Steven Burke and Peter Kennaugh. This quartet had proven successful in the lead up to the Games, winning the 2012 World Championships in world record time. Many felt that the Olympics would be a rematch of the World Championships, with the strong Australian team racing against the Britons for gold while the Russians challenged New Zealand for bronze.
The qualification round got the event off to a blistering start, with the British squad shaving nearly a second off of their world record time from earlier in the year. The only minor surprise was that Denmark outclassed the Russians by nearly a second in the qualifications, finishing fourth overall. Russia got its revenge in the semi-finals, however, beating the Danes by nearly two-tenths of a second and confirming many analysts’ predictions about the competitors in the final matches. In fact, it turned out that the podium results were exactly the same as in the World Championships:  New Zealand took home bronze in a victory over Russia and Great Britain took nearly another second off of the world record that they had set the day before on their way to winning the gold medal, leaving Australia once again with silver.

Born an ethnic Albanian in Kosovo, when it was still part of Serbia, she had to compete for Albania in 2012. Alhough still not recognized by many countries after declaring independence, the NOC of Kosovo was acknowledged by the IOC in 2014. This paved the way for Kelmendi to compete for her home country. Her gold medal was Kosovo’s first Olympic medal of any colour.
Early in the competition, she met Christianne Legentil from Mauritius, to whom she had lost in 2012. Again she had to struggle, but eventually defeated the African on penalties. In the semi-final Kelmendi had another tough fight, when she edged out three-time World Champion Misato Nakamura by just one penalty. In the final against Italy’s Odette Giuffrida she scored a Yuko after 29 seconds, which was enough to clinch the gold. Giuffrida’s silver came as a bigger surprise than Kelmendi’s gold. Her only previous international medal was a bronze at the 2015 European Games, but she advanced to the Rio final after defeating the top ranked Romanian Andreea Chițu. As at Beijing in 2008, Nakamura had to take consolation with a bronze medal alongside Russian Nataliya Kuzyutina. In the elimination round, Nakamura defeated Kuzyutina in the longest bout with an Ippon (full point) 3:39 minutes into the Golden Score period.
Allegations were raised that Joud Fahmy of Saudi Arabia deliberately forfeited her first-round match against Legentil to avoid meeting Israeli Gili Cohen in the second round. These were rejected by Saudi Arabian officials stating that Fahmy was injured and advised by medical staff not to compete.

Arno Kamminga of the Netherlands had won silver at Tokyo in the 100 breaststroke and was also highly considered.
Chupkov and Kamminga both qualified for the final but the heats and semi-finals were led by Australian Zac Stubblety-Cook, who led the world list coming into Tokyo with his 2:06.28 at the Australian Olympic Trials (Stubblety-Cook and Kamminga actually co-led the preliminary round in 2:07.37).
Kamminga took the final out fast, leading at the 50, 100, and 150 metre marks, as Stubblety-Cook lingered back in sixth and fifth place, and Chupkov was eighth and last for much of the early going. However, Kamminga died on the final lap, recording the slowest split of the finalists and barely hung on for the silver medal. Stubblety-Cook recorded the fastest final 50 split in the final by over 7/10ths of a second and came on for gold, as Chupkov was touched out for bronze by little known Matti Mattsson of Finland.

Austria thus settled for silver while Savina snuck ahead of van der Anker-Doedens to claim bronze. Svendsen, meanwhile, was fifth. One other notable participant was Therese Zenz who, representing the French protectorate of Saar (1947-1956), finished ninth, which was her nation’s second-best performance at the Games (behind Erich Schmidt’s joint-eighth in lightweight Greco-Roman wrestling).

Fate then intervened as teammate Dario Mangiarotti sustained a foot injury and Cantone was chosen to replace him. Cantone qualified for the final pool easily enough although he was by no means the most impressive of the qualifiers and went on to lose to the two Italian compatriots early in the decisive phase but then something strange happened. As Cantone notched up victories, the rest failed to take advantage of his early defeats and no one else could post better than a 5-4 win loss record. Since he was no more than the 4th or 5th ranked of the Italian fencers, his victory was clearly unexpected as was the silver medal gained by Oswald Zappelli of Switzerland.

With Russia out of the weightlifting competition at the 2016 Rio Games, one of the favourites for gold, the two-time World and European champion and 2012 Olympic bronze medalist Ruslan Albegov, was also out.
But this was a deeply talented category anyway, with the defending Olympic champion Behdad Salimi of Iran, the 2015 World champion Lasha Talakhadze (promoted to 1st place after Russia’s Aleksey Lovchev failed a doping test), Mart Seim of Estonia and Armenia’s Gor Minasyan, the 2015 World silver and bronze medalists respectively.
The lead bounced around in the snatch with Salimi opening at 206 kg, then had a 211 kg snatch. Talakhadze then broke Salimi’s snatch world record when he lifted 215 kg, only to have Samili re-set it at 216 kg a minute later, and entered the clean & jerk narrowly in the lead by 1 kg, with Talakhadze right behind him.
Salimi, the Olympic champion was desperately trying to defend his title, but could not complete any of his three attempts on the clean & jerk and bombed out. While he disagreed with the judge’s ruling on his first two attempts, he didn’t have the energy to complete the third.
Talakhadze, who had six good lifts on the day, had a clean & jerk lift of 258 kg, 11 kg  more than his second, and it gave him the surprise Olympic title, against what could have been a distracting backdrop.
Security forces were called in after Iranian coaches reacted furiously to Talakhadze’s win over Salimi where he and the head coach of Iran’s team, Sajjad Anoushrivani, were yelling, screaming and angrily approaching the jury, claiming there was a conspiracy led by an Iraqi on the jury.
With Talakhadze’s 473 kg total, he surpassed the 472 kg world record mark of Iranian, Hossein Reza Zadeh, set 16 years ago at the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney.
Minasyan finished 22 kg behind Talakhadze and won Armenia’s third silver medal of the Games, after wrestler Migran Arutyunyan, and weightlifter Simon Martirosyan.

She sustained an open tibia fracture with personal nerve damage and, as she later recalled, “[t]he muscles on the outside of my right leg were peeled back and hanging down to the ankle … the doctors thought I would never row again.” She did, however, manage to recover enough to compete in Barcelona, albeit walking with a cane and wearing a brace on her leg during competition, but was no longer promulgated as the favorite. That distinction now went to Romania’s Elisabeta Lipă, a three-time Olympic medalist in the double and quadruple sculls, the 1989 World Champion, and the runner-up at the most recent World Championship. Other contenders included Annelies Bredael of Belgium, the most recent World bronze medalist, and Anne Marden of the United States, the defending Olympic runner-up. Two other competitors had medals from the 1988 Games, albeit in different events: Bulgaria’s Violeta Yordanova had won bronze in the double sculls and Germany’s Beate Schramm was a champion in the quadruple sculls.
The opening round heats were won by Marden, Bredael, and Lipă, while Laumann put forth a valiant effort in Marden’s heat and came in second, with the third-fastest time overall, behind Marden and Lipă. An even bigger surprise came in the finals, when Laumann not only won a heat against Bredael, Schramm, and Yordanova, eliminating the latter two, but did so in Olympic record time, over a second ahead of Lipă, the other heat winner. In the final, Lipă won gold and Bredael won silver, but the true victory went to Laumann who, in only two months, had transformed a career-ending injury into an Olympic bronze medal. In Bud Greenspan’s official film of the Games, he attributes the following quote to a Canadian journalist: “Canada won four gold medals and one bronze medal at Lake Banyoles. Let the word go out that on this day the bronze shone as brightly in the Barcelona sun as any of the gold.” Lipă, meanwhile, gained her fourth and fifth Olympic medals with gold and silver in the single and double sculls respectively.

Very little has been written about this tournament. In fact, prior to research by one of the MADmen (Mallon), team rosters had never been given for the three teams that lost in the first round. They were all given in Journal des Sports. One of the rosters, that of the German team, differs from the normaly seen team roster given in one well-known Germany source. There is also some controversy about the team composition for the champion Osborne Swimming Club of Manchester (see below); the Brussels Swimming and Water Polo Club of Belgium; and the Pupilles de Neptune de Lille team, which lost in the semis to Osborne.
The Osborne Swimming Club was the class of the tournament. They won their three matches by 12-0, 10-1, and 7-2. However, descriptions of the matches make it appear that they won as they wished, and the margins could have been larger, had they pressed the matter.
Traditionally, the British team is listed as composed of Thomas Coe, John Derbyshire, Peter Kemp, William Lister, Arthur Robertson, Eric Robinson and George Wilkinson. However, only one contemporary source listing a roster is known, which gives the seven names listed below (Henry, Crawshaw, Jarvis, Stapleton, Lindberg, Coe and Kemp). Of the “traditional” roster, Lister certainly did not compete: he died of typhoid fever in the Boer War two weeks before the Games. Wilkinson played in a match in Walsall during the Olympic tournament, and Robinson and Derbyshire played in Manchester two days after the final match. This leaves only Robertson, but there is no evidence he was even selected for the Olympic team.

As such it seemed an obvious prediction that two time World Champion Tatjana Hüfner and compatriots Natalie Geisenberger and Anke Wischnewski would be the sliders to beat in Vancouver. The main threat to German victory came from a pair of North Americans. In February 2009 American Erin Hamlin had broken the 15-year run of German victories in major global championships by becoming the first World Champion from the USA whilst Alex Gough of Canada, 8th in the 2009-10 World Cup, had more experience on the track conditions than any other slider.
Following the tragic death of Nodar Kumaritashvili in practice it was decided that the women’s course would be over a shorter distance than originally planned, namely the junior course. This brought criticism particularly by the Canadian team, that some thought a little tactless considering the circumstances, that the contest would be turned into a lottery.
While this change was thought to favour those lugers with a more powerful start this proved only partially to be the case.  The angle of the start, designed for junior races, was not designed for the power of the senior races.  The racers had to make a compromise between the need to carry the speed of a powerful start and the necessity to negotiate a difficult corner without being forced up high onto the ice wall and losing all the advantage gained.
The Germans Tatjana Hüfner and Natalie Geisenberger were favoured to take the first two medals but, rather surprisingly Nina Reithmayer (AUT) led after the first run in a track record time of 41.728 seconds. However Hüfner clawed her way back to take the lead after the second run and retained her lead for the rest of the competition to take the gold medal with the fastest runs in the 2nd, 3rd and 4th runs. Reithmayer managed to hold on to the silver medal place ahead of Geisenberger who, despite having only the 7th best time on the final run, held on to take the bronze from fast finishing Tatyana Ivanova (RUS). World champion Erin Hamlin failed to cope with the changes to the circuit and placed a lowly 16th as European athletes took the first 14 places in the finishing order.
The safety of the competitors was paramount after the tragic death of Nodar Kumaritashvili on a training run but the women’s event was not entirely free of injury. Violeta Strămăturaru of Romania was knocked unconscious during a training run and the ensuing concussion forced her to withdraw from the Games.

Add to that list the English Premier League players Douglas Luiz (Aston Villa), Gabriel Martinelli (Arsenal) and Richarlison (Everton), and was obvious Brazil had a team that would take some beating.
Spain was regarded as the best of the European nations, and were hoping to end their 21-year drought without an Olympic medal. They qualified for Tokyo 2020 after winning the 2019 UEFA European Under-21 Championship in Italy. Experienced players like Dani Ceballos, Mikel Merino, and Marco Asensio, were joined by six members of their Euro 2021 squad who headed to Tokyo two weeks after reaching the semi-final at Wembley. The six were Mikel Oyarzabal, Unai Simon. Pau Torres, Eric García, Dani Olmo, and Barcelona’s 18-year-old Pedri González, who became the youngest Spanish player to appear in the European Championships finals in 2021 when he started against Sweden aged 18 years and 201 days.
After being runners-up to Spain in the 2019 UEFA European Under-21 Championship, Germany were also fancied, while another European team in with a chance was the young French squad, with five members of their 22-man squad under the age of 20, including the tournament’s youngest player, Ismael Doukoure of Valenciennes, who was 18 on the day after the Tokyo opening ceremony. If any team was capable of springing at surprise in Tokyo it was the Australian “Olyroos”. They were led by Graham Arnold, who was no stranger to the Olympics as he was a player at Seoul in 1988, assistant coach at Athens in 2004, and head coach at Beijing four years later, which was the last time Australia qualified.
The opening day of the men’s tournament saw Spain and Egypt get the competition under way, but the most eagerly awaited match of the day was that between the 2016 champions Brazil and beaten finalists Germany. Remarkably, Brazil raced to a 3-0 lead within half-an-hour, thanks to a hat-trick from Everton’s Richarlison. Brazil missed a penalty on the stroke of half-time before letting Germany back into the game with two second-half goals, but the defending champions scored a late goal to win 4-2.
The surprise of the opening day saw Thomas Deng lead Australia to a 2-0 win over the fancied Argentinians. Deng was born in Kenya and, when he was six, his family was granted refugee status in Australia to escape the crisis in Sudan. German captain Maximilian Arnold, Francisco Ortega (Argentina), and Aboubacar Doumbia (Ivory Coast) all received their marching orders on the opening day of the men’s tournament.
After the second round of group matches only the hosts Japan had maximum points while South Africa and Saudi Arabia were pointless. The Saudis came close to a shock, however, when they came from 2-0 behind to Germany to draw level before losing 3-2. Germany had a player dismissed for the second match in succession when Amos Pieper received his marching orders in the 66th minute. Brazil were also down to 10 men when Douglas Luiz was sent off after 13 minutes, but they managed to hold out for a goalless draw against Ivory Coast, who had Manchester United youngster Amad Diallo in their midfield. Spain and France both left it late to secure wins, France doing so in the 82nd minute after coming from behind three times to beat South Africa 4-3.
The final round of group matches saw Brazil qualify for the last eight with ease thanks to a star performance and two more goals from Richarlison in a 3-1 win over Saudi Arabia. This group also provided a shock with Germany making an exit after being held to a 1-1 draw by the Ivory Coast, and a third-place finish meant they were eliminated. South Korea won their final game 6-0 against Honduras with the help of three penalties and the other team to qualify in from this group was New Zealand.
The only team to reach the last eight with a 100% record was Japan, who rounded off their group fixtures with a 4-0 win over 10-man France. One of their goals was scored by Real Madrid’s Takefusa Kubo, who had netted in each of Japan’s first three games, as he became the first Japanese player to score in three consecutive games at the Olympics. France followed Germany in exiting the competition at the group stage. Former champions Argentina were also eliminated after a 1-1 draw with Spain and lost out on second place to Egypt on goal difference. Of the eight teams that made up the quarter-finals only Brazil, Mexico and Spain had won the title before.
Spain kicked off the quarter-finals in dramatic fashion the Ivory Coast. They were level at 1-1 until Max Gradel scored in the 91st minute for a seemingly victory for the Africans, but two minutes later Rafa Mir levelled for Spain a minute after coming on as a substitute, to take the game to extra time. Mikel Oyarzabal scored from the penalty spot after 98 minutes before Mir added two more goals deep into the extra period as Spain ran out 5-2 winners and set up a semi-final meeting with Japan, who beat New Zealand 4-3 on penalties after a goalless 120 minutes of play.
Egypt reached the last eight, despite being without the experience of Liverpool’s Mo Salah, and put up a good showing in their quarter-final match against Brazil, before succumbing to a solitary goal in the 37th minute from Matheus Cunha of Bundesliga side Hertha Berlin. Brazil, winners in 2016, set up a semi-final meeting with the 2012 winners Mexico, who ran riot in their quarter-final, beating South Korea 6-3.
Mexico’s luck ran out in their semi-final in a re-run of the 2012 final, when Brazil won 4-1 on penalties after a goalless 120 minutes. Brazil came close to snatching victory in the 82nd minute when a Richarlison header hit a post. The other semi-final saw Japan in the last four for the second time since 2012, while Spain were in their third semi-final, and first since 2000. The Spaniards had most of the play and like the first semi, it also went to extra time and the game was not resolved until five minutes from the end of the added period when Mallorcan-born Asensio of Real Madrid scored the winning goal.
The match for the bronze medal was a repeat of the 2012 London Olympic semi-final. Mexico beat Japan 3-1 that day, and that was the repeat outcome in Tokyo as the Japanese were denied the chance of adding to their solitary men’s medal, a bronze won at Mexico in 1968. Victory for Mexico gave them only their second men’s Olympic medal after the gold they won in 2012.
The two finalists were hoping to add to the solitary gold medal each had won previously, Brazil in 2016 and Spain back on home soil in 1992. The game was played in the Yokohama International Stadium, at a fast pace, and with both sides looking capable of winning but, at the same time, with neither wanting to lose, it was always going to be close contest.
The game came to life towards the end of the second half when Brazil were awarded a 38th penalty after a lengthy VAR review, but Richarlison put the spot kick high over the cross bar. Then, in the third extra minute at the end of the first half, Cunha put Brazil 1-0 ahead. A terrific volleyed goal from Real Sociedad’s Mikel Oyarzabal in the 61st minute put the teams level. Both sides went for a winning goal in regulation time, and Spain hit the bar twice in the last five minutes but it ended 1-1, and for their third game in succession, Spain were playing extra time.
The deadlock was broken in the 108th minute when Antony released a long cross-field ball to the substitute Malcom, who ran onto it and beat the advancing Spanish goalkeeper Simon to put Brazil back in front. Instead of sitting back on their lead, Brazil went for a third goal while the Spaniard’s went in search of the equaliser but there was no further score and Brazil, led by 38-year-old Dani Alves, became the fifth country, and the first since Argentina in 2008, to win back-to-back men’s finals.

Radcliffe had run the marathon in Athina, but dropped out in that race, held five days earlier. Still hurting, she was not a factor in the 10K, although she led the early kilometres. She lost contact on the 15th lap and stopped on the 19th. That left the lead to the Ethiopian team of Ejegayehu Dibaba, 1992 and 2000 champion Derartu Tulu, and Werknesh Kidane, China’s Xing Huina, and Kenya’s Lornah Kiplagat. Xing was somewhat unheralded but had set a world junior record of 30:31.55 at the 2003 Worlds. This group stayed together until the last lap, when Dibaba took off, chased by Xing. Off the last turn, Xing pulled ahead for the gold medal, but it was Dibaba who celebrated. Dibaba did not realize that Xing was on the same lap, thinking she had been lapped. She raised her hands joyfully as she crossed the line, but it would only be for the silver medal.

At the Calgary World Cup in December 1997, the record was lowered to 1:16.07 by Catriona Le May Doan, only to be bettered by Chris Witty the very next day. The third skater to have won international competitions that season was Franziska Schenk (Germany), winner of 3 World Cup races and bronze medalist at the 1997 Worlds. After her victory in the 1,500 m, Marianne Timmer was also highly considered. She had taken the 1997 World Championships, and was one of the early adopters of the clap skate, but had not yet medaled internationally in the Olympic season.
After 16 pairs, the former World Record and Olympic Record by Rothenburger was still unbeaten. But 500 m champion Catriona Le May Doan again bested the old record, clocking 1:17.37. This was enough to hold off Sabine Völker (second at the World Sprints), but not Timmer. She trailed her opponent, Schenk, at the first split, but Schenk fell in the next corner. Timmer then improved on Le May’s time by 8 tenths, lowering the Olympic Record to 1:16.51. The only remaining contender was Chris Witty, who matched Timmer’s split times, but not her final lap, to finish in 1:16.51.

The latter, reigning world champion, and a winner this year in a Championship Tour event, was expected to shine with his renowned aerial prowess. Medina, two-time world champion, was also peaking, having made four of five finals in 2021 World Surf League events and winning two of them. Other strong medal hopefuls were Japan’s Kanoa Igarashi, 2019 world ranked number six, a native of California but of Japanese parentage, whose father had surfed at Tsurigasaki Beach while growing up in that country, and American veteran surfer, John John Florence, former two-time world champion. Another veteran hoping to make the podium was Australia’s Owen Wright, past winner of four World Surf League events, who had suffered a devastating brain injury in 2015 during competition, requiring him to relearn how to talk, walk, and surf again.
Florence was the first of the favourites to fall once competition began, being eliminated in Round 3 by fellow countryman Kolohe Andino. Medals days offered very difficult conditions, due to the offshore storm, but promised some stellar wave conditions. In the quarterfinals, the remaining top favourites moved through, with Japan’s Igarashi dispatching the United States’ Andino. The semifinals provided a set of exciting contests, with Igarashi defeating Brazil’s Medina by the narrowest of margins, and the latter’s countryman, Ferreira, closing out Australia’s Wright in another close result. The bronze medal event continued the nail biters with Owen Wright emerging the winner by .20 points, capping a truly remarkable career comeback. The gold medal contest was a bit anticlimactic as Ferreira decisively trimmed Igarashi, and that despite breaking a board and requiring a replacement. The win cemented his standing in surfing circles, with the Olympic gold medal added to his World Surf League Championship Tour title, and World Surfing Games gold medal, both in 2019.

In the butterfly final, Biondi went out ahead well ahead to the wall. He led the race until the last stroke, but as he neared the wall, he was between strokes and elected to kick in, only to be slightly farther out than he realized, and this allowed Suriname’s Anthony Nesty to pass him and win the gold medal by 1/100th of a second. Nesty was not unknown, having placed fourth at the 1986 World Championships, and winning gold at the 1987 Pan American Games, but this was an upset, and it was the first Olympic medal ever won for Suriname, and also made Nesty the first black swimmer to win an Olympic gold medal.
Nesty had trained and lived and went to college in the United States for several years. But he considered Suriname home and returned to a hero’s welcome, being showered with gifts. He would return to Barcelona four years hence and add a bronze medal in this event. Biondi recovered fairly well from his poor start in Seoul, winning five golds in his last five races.

Ties broken by lightest bodyweight.,na,"This class had been contested since the 1980 Olympics with a weight limit of ≤100 kg, but the International Weightlifting Federation (IWF) changed the limit to 99 kg, in their “cleansing” of the world record lists that had been so affected by doping in 80s and 90s. When women were added to the Olympic weightlifting program in 2000, the men were cut back to eight classes, and this was the last time this class was held at the Olympics. The favorite was Akakios Kakiasvili, a Georgian-born Greek who had won the middle-heavyweight class in 1992 when representing the Unified Team. Kazakh lifter Anatoly Khrapaty had been the middle-heavy gold medalist in 1988 for the Soviet Union, but had not medalled internationally since 1990. He was back in Atlanta, also moving up to the heavyweight I division. Ukraine’s Tymur Taimazov had been the silver medalist in 1992 but he also moved up in weight in Atlanta, competing as a heavyweight II.
Khrapaty took the lead in the snatch with 187.5 kg, tied with Ukrainian Denys Hotfrid, as Kakiasvili trailed with 185.0 kg. However, Kakiasvili dropped everyone with a world record 235.0 kg in the clean & jerk and won the gold medal with a 10 kg margin over Khrapaty as Hotfrid won the bronze medal. Kakiasvilli would win his third consecutive gold medal in 2000, but again as a middle-heavyweight.
