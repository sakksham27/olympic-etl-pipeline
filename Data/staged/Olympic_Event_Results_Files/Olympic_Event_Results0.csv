Reza Zadeh led after the snatch with 210.0 kg, and then lifted a world record 262.5 kg in the clean & jerk, matching his world record total of 472.5 kg. His clean & jerk was re-measured at 263.5 kg for record purposes. German Ronny Weller had been the silver medalist in this class in 1996 and 2000, and had won medals at the last four Olympics. Attempting to become the first weightlifter to win five medals, he injured himself on his second snatch, and dropped out of the competition. Latvia’s Viktors Ščerbatihs won silver, although well behind Reza Zadeh, and he would return in 2008 and add a bronze medal in the class.

The heavy favorite was France’s Karine Ruby, who had won all but one World Cup event in 1997-98, and had won the 1996 FIS World Championships. On the first run, she overwhelmed the field, leading by 1.95 second over her teammate, Isabelle Blanc. On the second run Ruby boarded carefully to protect her lead but still won the gold medal by almost two seconds over Germany’s Heidi Renoth. Blanc had the silver medal in her grasp when she missed the final gate on her second run, and fell, sliding across the finish line. Ruby would compete again at the 2002 and 2006 Winter Olympics, winning a silver medal in 2002 in parallel giant slalom, and switching to boardercross for the 2006 Winter Olympics. She then began training to become a mountain guide and was killed in late May 2009 when she fell into a crevasse on Mont Blanc. Isabelle Blanc returned in 2002 to win the gold medal in the parallel giant slalom.

The strength of the East German team was shown from the fact that the reigning World Champion and 1972 bronze medallist, Wolfram Fiedler, did not make the cut. This left 1973 World Champion Hans Rinn as the clear favourite. But he made a serious error in the first run, putting him 0.6 seconds behind Dettlef Günther, who had been the 1975 European Champion, but had only managed a 7th spot at the World Championships. Günther would also win the 3rd and 4th run, giving him a comfortable lead. Only West German Josef Fendt could seriously challenge him, but even the former World Champion (1970, 1973) had to concede half a second in the final standings.
The unluckiest slider in Innsbruck was without a doubt Huang Liu-Chong. He was actually the best non-European, as shown by his performances in the first and fourth run, but he finished last because of two crashes in the other two runs. Remarkably, he did finish both times, but ended up more than one minute behind the next-to-last luger – a huge gap in luge terms.

962,"1,500 metres, Men",1928 Winter Olympics,30,Speed Skating,/editions/30/sports/SSK,14 February 1928 — 9:00,"Olympia-Eisstadion Badrutts Park, St. Moritz",30 from 14 countries,na,na,"There was little doubt that the Olympic 1500 m title would be retained by Clas Thunberg. He had clocked a 2:18.8 nine days earlier in Davos, and all of the other season best times were at least 1.8 seconds slower. In fact, Thunberg had not lost a 1500 m all season, winning this distance at the Finnish, European and World Championships. Behind him, the Norwegians were expected to divide the medals, with the Americans as outsiders.
The Americans opened, with Eddie Murphy (2:25.9) and Irving Jaffee (2:26.7) setting the pace. The third American, John O’Neil Farrell, was beaten by Roald Larsen of Norway, who also moved in front. Two more Norwegians followed, Olympic 5000 m champion Ivar Ballangrud and Wollert Nygren. The latter, a substitute for the sick Staksrud, had done well in Davos, but disappointed in St. Moritz. Not so for Ballangrud, who took the lead with a very decent 2:22.6. He didn’t have to wait long to see what that time was worth. The very next race paired Thunberg and Bernt Evensen, the fastest of the Norwegians in the )metric mile). The two fought a great race, and were still level coming out of the final bend. Thunberg then emerged as the better sprinter, winning in 2:21.1, eight tenths ahead of Evensen.
The twelfth place of Charlie Gorman is somewhat contentious. He showed up late for the start, but was allowed to skate against Siem Heiden in the final pair, but out of competition. The Official Report mentions that “his time would be noted, but would not count”. Yet, he is listed as 12th in several newspapers, while other 1928 sources do list him as out of competition.

Martikán was the 2007 and 2008 European and 2007 World Champion, as well as the 2006 European and World runner-up and the 2005 World bronze medalist. Estanguet, meanwhile, was the 2006 European and World Champion and the 2005 and 2007 World runner-up. Another strong contender was Rob Bell of Australia, the 2005 World Champion and 2007 bronze medalist.
Martikán came out on top of the standings in the qualification round, followed by Jan Benzien of Germany, the 2002 World runner-up and European bronze medalist, and Great Britain’s David Florence, while Estanguet and Bell were sixth and seventh respectively. The Beijing Olympics introduced a one-round semi-final for the remaining 12 participants, which Martikán won, while Estanguet was surprisingly eliminated alongside Benzien. Florence and Bell were fourth and fifth respectively, behind Martikán, Stanislav Ježek of the Czech Republic, and Poland’s Krzysztof Bieryt. Ježek was the 2006 World bronze medalist, as well as the 2008 European runner-up, while Bieryt was the 2004 European runner-up. These five men had the same rankings after the first run of the final, but Ježek and Bieryt were sixth and eighth respectively in the second run, allowing Florence and Bell to claim silver and bronze respectively behind Martikán, who regained his title after 12 years and without having lost a single round.

At 20 km there will still a number of skiers in contention, but after ski changes Kowalczyk and Bjørgen began to pull away from the field, until only these two were in contention for the gold and silver. Bjørgen made the first move, pulling ahead of Kowalczyk with a few kilometres to go and gaining around a 6-second advantage, but the lead was never decisive and Kowalczyk caught up with her on the final climb. It then came down to a sprint to the line which Kowalczyk won, covering the course in a time of 1-30:33.7, just 0.3 seconds ahead of Bjørgen. The bronze medal was won by Aino-Kaisa Saarinen (FIN), her finishing time being over a minute behind the other medallists, but comfortably ahead of fourth placed Evi Sachenbacher-Stehle (GER). After the race, Kowalczyk apologized to Bjørgen for her accusations, “I am sorry, because it wasn’t such a good time for such a question and opinion. It wasn’t an attack on Marit. She is a very good athlete, but I was trying to talk about the asthma problem we have in cross-country, there are a lot of athletes sick with asthma.” Bjørgen also addressed the issue after the race, “That annoyed me a little bit, but for me it’s already yesterday’s news. I was a little bit disappointed in the beginning when she started this, but I have to forget it.”

But he turned professional in 1975 and was not in Montréal. A bronze medalist from the 1974 Worlds was there, however, one Leon Spinks of the United States. An ungainly fighter with powerful hands, but seemingly little skill, Spinks made it to the final and entered the ring shortly after his brother, Michael, had won a gold medal in the middleweight final. In the final Leon met Cuba’s Sixto Soria, who had not fought the distance in any bout in Montréal, winning his quarter-final and semi-final in the first rounds. But the final was no contest, as Spinks battered Soria all around the ring for three rounds, with the referee mercifully stopping the bout at 1:09 of the third. Soria would come back in 1978 to win the World Championship.
Leon Spinks turned professional after the 1976 Olympics, and after only seven fights, faced Muhammad Ali for the world heavyweight title, in what was considered to be a mismatch. Inexplicably, Spinks won a 15-round decision to become world champion, but in a re-match seven months later, Ali won easily, and Spinks had seen the best of his career. He fought through 1995, a punching bag near the end, ending with a professional record of 26 wins, 17 losses, and 3 draws. He later had a brief career as a pro wrestler, and then, his financial life in ruins, spent time on the streets as a homeless person. His son, Cory Spinks, also became a professional world champion.

The Canadian, however, posted the fastest times in both the heats and the semi-finals, drawing attention away from Hoff. In the final van Koeverden took an early lead and maintained it for the first 750 metres, but a strong push from Larsen in the closing quarter of the race saw the Norwegian make up nearly an entire length of distance between the two. Leaving the rest of the pack behind them, Larsen and van Koeverden went neck and neck in the final stretch, with the Canadian being just edged out by the Norwegian’s experience and technical prowess in the final metres. Larsen thus reclaimed the title he had lost in 2008 and van Koeverden took home silver, his fourth Olympic medal after having won gold and bronze at the 2004 Summer Olympics in the K-1500 m and K-1000 m respectively, and silver in the K-1500 m in Beijing. Hoff covered the open water between Larsen and van Koeverden and nearly stole second place from the Canadian, but had to settle for bronze after coming up short by just under six-tenths of a second.

Koga had briefly retired after the 1992 Olympics but came back for the 1995 Worlds. He had won five consecutive Kodakan Cups and six consecutive All-Japan championships. Koga made it to the final easily, where he faced France’s Djamel Bouras, whose previous biggest accomplishment was a bronze at the 1995 Worlds. The final was a defensive battle, with Koga leading until he was penalized for passivity with only 12 seconds remaining. This brought the match to hantei, with all three judges giving the decision to Bouras for the gold medal. Bouras would win a silver medal at the 1997 Worlds, while Koga would continue to compete thru 2000, but was never again a major factor at internationals.

Imre Mándi of Hungary and Cook of Australia were also expected to put in  strong performances.
Mándi’s victory over the US boxer Chester Rutecki was hotly disputed by the American team management, Mándi hit the canvas in the first round and was warned for fouling on four occasions but won the decision. US boxing coach Johnny Behr was quoted as saying “This beats the Olympic record for terrible decisions” and the US boxing team withdrew from the Olympics, only to reconsider their decision an hour later. Another controversy occurred in the very first bout of the competition, when Uruguay’s Costanzo was disqualified in his match against Tritz of France, his supporters surrounded the ring and threatened to slit the referee’s throat.
Finland’s Sten Suvio was not blessed with an easy draw, he faced Cook and Mándi in successive rounds but managed to gain the decision over both. After a semi-final victory over the eventual bronze medal winner, Pedersen of Denmark, he found himself facing Murach in the final. Very much the outsider in the final, Suvio bided his time in the first three minutes as Murach launched his attacks. Suvio’s opportunity came halfway through the second round; a hard right hand stopped the German in his tracks and changed the course of the fight. The Finn began to dominate, landing punch after punch and Murach briefly visited the canvas as he tired badly. Suvio’s victory was the first gold medal victory by a Finnish boxer.
Micheal Murach went on to defeat Mándi in the final of the 1937 European Championship but was to die fighting on the Eastern Front in 1941, Sven Suvio fought in the Finnish army but survived to resume his modestly successful career as a professional.

Raisa Smetanina was the reigning World Champion, and also won silver at the inaugural event in 1978. The big question was if Marja-Liisa Hämälainen could win a clean sweep and take her third individual gold medal in Sarajevo. The 27-year old Finn, nicknamed the “Iron Maiden” by the Norwegian press, started in a controlled way, lying third at 3.5 km, 6.6 seconds behind the leader, Smetanina, but only 0.1 seconds behind Brit Pettersen from Norway, who was second. But Hämälainen soon took control of the race. At the halfway point, she was 13 seconds ahead of her Soviet rival, with Pettersen further behind but still in third place. At 13.5 km Smetanina was still in contention, only 12 seconds behind. Moving up from seventh to third was Czechoslovakia’s Blanka Paulů, but too far behind the leaders to fight for the gold medal. Norway’s Anne Jahren was five seconds behind Paulů, closely followed by Marie Risby, Lyubov Lyadova and Pettersen, all about ten seconds from the bronze medal position.
Jahren, with start number 4, took the early lead at the finish, and Lyadova, Paulů and Risby failed to beat Jahren’s final time, the Czech skiier finishing just three seconds back. Then Hämälainen finished strongly as usual, having beaten Jahren by half a minute over the last 6.5 km. Smetanina could not respond to Hämälainen’s finish, and won her second silver medal at the Sarajevo Games, beaten by over 40 seconds.
Marja-Liisa Hämälainen had made it, winning all three individual distances in the 1984 games. She had participated both in the 1976 and 1980 games without success, finishing 18th at 10 km in 1980 as her previous Olympic best. Now she was definitely the cross-country queen of the 1984 games. Later in 1984 she married her teammate Harri Kirvesniemi, and, under her new family name, participated in three more Winter Olympic Games, being the first woman to participate at six Winter Olympics.

His biggest challenger was expected to be Russian Sergey Shubenkov, running for the Russian Olympic Committee team, but he tweaked his Achilles’ tendon warming up for the event and could not start.
The heats only solidified Holloway’s favorite status as he ran 13.02 to win his first-round heat, the fastest ever heat time. Two of the semi-finals were won by Jamaica’s Daniel Levy and American Devon Allen, with Holloway winning the third.
The final was run on a very hot morning and Holloway took off, leading through six hurdles. He then had two overly high clearances and was suddenly challenged by Jamaican Hansle Parchment, who was on nobody’s form chart coming into Tokyo. Holloway still led after nine hurdles, but Parchment had a perfect clearance over the final hurdle and outleaned Holloway for the gold medal, as Levy took the bronze medal.
Parchment had been the bronze medalist in 2012 at London, and won silver at the 2015 World Championships, but had few top results to speak of since that time. He was also fortunate to even make it to the final. Parchment took the wrong bus on the morning of the final and it took him to the wrong venue. He needed to take a taxi to the athletics stadium but had no money on him. An Olympic volunteer, named Tijana Kawashima, loaned him the money for the taxi ride and he made it to the stadium in time to win gold.
The next day, Parchment tracked down Kawashima, re-paid her, showed her his gold medal, and gave her a Jamaican tee-shirt. The Jamaican government also later invited Kawashima and a guest to visit Jamaica for an all-expense paid full week vacation.

In the round-robin portion of the competition, Switzerland and Sweden led the field, with the former losing only once, to Sweden, and the latter only falling to Great Britain and host China. The ROC team won only once in a major disappointment, and there turned out to be a real log jam in the middle of the field, prompting the final two teams moving through to the medal round to be decided by the new tie breaker format. Canada, Great Britain, and Japan all finished with 5-4 records, and since they all went 1-1 during head-to-head meetings, their respective average distance during the week’s pre-game two throw draw to the button settled their placements, with Canada being the odd team out. The first semi-final between Sweden and Great Britain was a classic, with lots of rocks in play, and plenty of big ends. Great Britain looked to be in real trouble after giving up four points in the first end, but fought their way back and surged into the lead with four of their own in the ninth end. Sweden attempted to rally with three in the 10th, but fell short in a 12-11 final.

Chinese Taipei secured the bronze medal with a 5-3 victory against Italy.
Particularly unlucky losers were Aida Roman from Mexico and Carolina Aguirre from Colombia. Under time pressure, Roman shot only a five with her last regular arrow.

In the final, Flanagan improved on his last throw to 170-4¼ (51.92) to repeat his victories of 1900 and 1904.  Flanagan commented on his victory 20 years later, )It was, without doubt, one of the most satisfying competition wins of my life.  Matt McGrath tended to be a little arrogant and I had the feeling he believed he was certain to win.  When it all came down to my last throw I knew I had to put everything into it and as it turned out I did.  If I have any regret at all now, it is that I was not competing for Ireland on that day.)
John Flanagan had won the Olympic title in 1900 and 1904 and was then considered the greatest hammer thrower of the 20th century.  He set 18 marks considered as world records between 1896 and 1909.  Flanagan would win seven AAU hammer championships and six titles with the 56-lb. weight.  Of Irish birth (Kilbreedy, County Limerick), he had emigrated to the United States in 1897.  Amazingly for a man of his size (5’10” [1.78 metres], 220 lbs. [100 kg.]), he finished second in both the high and long jump and the all-around at the 1895 Irish Championships.
By 1908, Matt McGrath (USA) was becoming Flanagan’s rival for hammer throw supremacy.  He first appeared on the national scene in 1907, finishing 2nd in the AAU championship, but he was a world-class hammer thrower until 1928, winning seven AAU titles (the last in 1926), setting two world records, and winning three Olympic medals - silvers in 1908 and 1924, and a gold in 1912.  In his defense, it was noted that he had injured his knee in the spring of 1908 and was not fully recovered from that by the time of the Olympics.
Interestingly, all three medal winners were born in Ireland and with Scotsman, Tom Nicolson, finishing in fourth place, it was a memorable day for Celtic throwers.  The bronze medalist, Con Walsh, had been born in Carriganimma, County Cork, but spent most of his athletic career in Canada, and may have had the most potential of any of the throwers.  The 1920 Olympic hammer champion, Paddy Ryan (USA), commented on Walsh in a 1958 interview, )Con liked the good life and as far as he was concerned training was not part of the good life.  He could have beaten the lot of us but he never bothered with any serious training.  He was lazy but thoroughly enjoyed competition and was a wonderful man to know at all times.)

It returned for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, but with some caveats. The women and the men, who played baseball, would have only six teams in their tournaments, to keep the number of athletes smaller. To avoid requiring the Organizing Committee to build an extra new facility, softball was played on a baseball diamond, with the baseball pitchers’ mound strangely located between second base and the softball mound. Outfield fences were artificially moved in, which meant there was no warning track for outfielders.
The six teams in the Olympic Tournament were Japan, the United States, Canada, Mexico, Australia, and Italy. They played a round-robin tournament that advanced the top two, the USA and Japan, to the gold medal game, while the 3rd- and 4th-place finishers, Mexico and Canada, played for the bronze medal.
The bronze medal game was held first on 27 July. Canada scored two runs in the second inning and added another in the fifth. Mexico chipped away with runs in the third and fifth innings but could not score in the top of the seventh, and Canada held on for the win and the bronze medal, 3-2.
The pitching match-up for the gold medal game was Japan’s Yukiko Ueno facing American Cat Osterman. Osterman had played at the 2004 and 2008 Olympics and had come out of retirement to play in Tokyo at 38-years-old. Osterman was pulled in the third inning, after loading the bases, although Ally Carda got her out of the jam in relief. She gave up runs to Japan in the fourth and fifth innings and was replaced by Monica Abbott but it was too late for the Americans, who never scored. Miu Goto relieved Ueno in the 7th inning and closed out the game for a 2-0 shut-out and a Japanese gold medal. Japan actually defended their gold medal, as they also won in 2008.

The surprise 1982 World Champion at the distance, Sweden’s Thomas Eriksson, was not able to qualify for the 1984 Olympics. Nikolay Zimyatov, the triple gold medalist in cross-country skiing at the 1980 games, was not on the Soviet team for the 1982 World Championships, and kept a low international profile in the years before the 1984 Games, but in January 1984 he won the Soviet 30 km Championships, and was selected for the Olympic team. At 30 km, the opening distance of the 1984 Games, Zimyatov showed that he was a man for big Olympic occasions. At the first intermediate time (6.8 km) he was in the lead, 17 seconds ahead of his teammate Aleksandr Zavyalov, with another Soviet skier, 22-year-old Vladimir Sakhnov, in fourth place, 32 seconds behind the leader. The only man who was able to split the Soviet trio was Sweden’s new cross-country star, Gunde  Svan, lying third two seconds ahead of Sakhnov. For the rest of the race the situation among the leading quartet was unchanged. At the last intermediate point, 8 km from home, Zimyatov had extended his lead to 46 seconds over Zavyalov, Svan only nine seconds behind. Zimyatov comfortably won his fourth Olympic gold medal with a margin of 27 seconds over his teammate Zavyalov. Svan, with the strongest finish, was only nine seconds behind Zavyalov in third place. Finland’s best was Aki Karvonen in fifth place, over two minutes behind the winner, and the silver medalist from the 1982 World Championships, Norway’s Lars Erik  Eriksen followed in sixth, almost another half a minute behind.
With four Olympic gold medals in cross-country skiing, Zimyatov was now equal to two other cross-country skiers: the great Swede Sixten  Jernberg (1964) and the cross-country queen of the 1970s, Galina  Kulakova.

This made Schmidt the favorite at the 1988 Summer Olympics, but she could expect at least a challenge from Bulgaria’s Vanya Gesheva, the 1986 World Champion in Schmidt’s absence. Gesheva set an Olympic record in the first opening heat, with Andersson coming in third behind Poland’s Izabella Dylewska-Światowiak, the most recent World runner-up. Schmidt, meanwhile, was second in her heat behind Denmark’s Yvonne Knudsen, the 1986 bronze medalist, who bested Gesheva’s record. Hungary’s Rita Kőbán took the third heat. Schmidt, Knudsen, and Dylewska-Światowiak defeated Gesheva, Andersson, and Kőbán respectively in the semi-finals, while the medal round came down to a fantastic battle to the finish between Schmidt and Gesheva, which the latter won surprisingly by only 0.12 seconds, leaving Fischer with silver. Kőbán had a similar battle with Dylewska-Światowiak in the final stretch, in which the latter emerged victorious by 0.2 seconds. Schmidt’s disappointment would not last, as she would go on to win the K-2 500 later that day and the K-4 500 the next, while Gesheva would complete a set of medals by taking silver and bronze in those events respectively.

Koss was the defending champion, and he had won the pre-Olympic World Cup on the Hamar rink back in December. But he faced stiff competition from both his own country and the Netherlands. Koss’ team mate Ådne Søndrål, had won two World Cup races earlier in the season, and had finished second behind Koss in the Albertville Games. Of the Dutch skaters, Falko Zandstra and Rintje Ritsma had the best chances. Zandstra had won the Davos World Cup, while Ritsma had won the distance at the European Championships in January in Hamar. Ritsma had then bettered the world record - which still dated from the 1988 Olympics - to 1:51.60.
Koss was the first of these favorites to race. Skating a final lap that was unheard of (29.38), he managed to beat Ritsma’s world best mark by 0.31 seconds, setting it at 1:51.29. Next up was Søndrål. While a sprinter, he couldn’t match Koss’s splits early on, and never came close to his compatriot’s time, despite setting a personal best of 1:53.13. In the next pair, it was Zandstra. At the bell, the Dutch World Allround Champion was about equal with Koss, but his final lap was over a second slower than the Norwegian’s. Ritsma, going in pair six, met with the same fate. Leading by two tenths at 1,100 m, he lost a lot in the last 400 m, ending up with 1:51.99, slightly outside his own former world record. At the victory press conference, Johann Olav Koss announced he would donate his victory reward to the victims of the war in Bosnia, and especially Sarajevo, the host of the 1984 Winter Olympics that had been ravaged by war.

Hungary and Bohemia were the only world class soccer nations who did not take part in the 1908 Games. Their late withdrawal reduced the number of competing teams to six and the Official Report gives the reason for their absence as “political troubles in the Balkans” though newspaper reports in their countries site “financial reasons”.  This was a rather laconic way of describing the annexation of Bosnia and Herzegovina by Austria, an action which ultimately led to the outbreak of World War I six years later. It was suggested that the Austrian government put political pressure on them to withdraw although the two nations were widely represented in other sports in London.
Similar to hockey, each country was allowed to field four separate teams. This was seen as a way of encouraging the host nation to field teams for England, Scotland, Ireland and Wales. Membership of FIFA (Fédération Internationale de Football Association) was not required to enter the Olympic tournament - only that the nation had a functioning Football Association. France had left FIFA earlier in the year but entered three teams and fielded two in London. Scotland, Ireland and Wales declined to participate so England were left to carry British hopes alone.Denmark, Holland and Sweden completed the entries.
The early rounds produced some high scoring matches and with their 17-1 defeat of France A, Denmark set an Olympic scoring record which has never beaten.  The Danish centre-forward, Sofus Nielsen, also set an Olympic record by individually scoring 10 of the goals in Denmark’s overwhelming victory.
Before a crowd of 8,000, Great Britain met Denmark in the final.  In a classic match, Britain scored a goal in each half to give them a 2-0 victory but the Danes were highly praised for their skill and commitment.  In a playoff match for third place Holland beat Sweden 2-0.  Great Britain and Denmark maintained their pre-eminent position in world soccer and met again in the 1912 Olympic final when Britain were again the winners (4-2).
Six Danes and two Britons played in both the 1908 and 1912 finals and as the Danish players, Charles Buchwald and Oscar Nielsen, had also played in the 1906 final they became the only male players in history to take part in three Olympic soccer finals.

Da Costa had a tentative start in pool B, losing his second pool match to Abdel Rahman Al-Masatfa (JOR), who would eventually finish with the bronze medal.
Da Costa won his semi-final against Assadilov after going behind early on a waza-ari. However Da Costa recovered with an ippon and waza-ari to record a 5-2 victory. The second semi-final was a much closer contest with Şamdan winning against Al-Masatfa with two yukos for a 2-0 victory.

However, the Soviets did not compete in the 1962 event, held in Colorado Springs, Colorado, and then easily won the 1963 World Championship.  They were heavy favorites at the 1964 Winter Olympics, and they did not disappoint, winning all 7 games, and outscoring their opponents 54-10 in the final round.  But it was actually closer than that.  The final game matched Canada and the Soviets, and if Canada won, they would have identical 6-1 records, and Canada would win by virtue of the head-to-head victory.  Canada led 2-1, near the end of the second period, but the Soviets scored to tie it up heading into the locker room.

This dropped Canada into a three-way tie for second with Sweden and Czechoslovakia. The tiebreak rule, announced before the tournament, was that in such a situation, the goals differentials would be used in games involving the tied teams. But the IIHF ruled late during the tournament that goal differential for all games would be the deciding factor. Under either rule, Sweden earned the silver medal. But under the original rule, Canada would be the bronze medalist, while under the revised rule, the bronze went to Czechoslovakia. In 2005, the IIHF corrected this problem by awarding bronze medals to the Canadians as well, for the concurrent 1964 World Championships, although the IOC has never done this.

The other medals went to Soviets Lyubov Rusanova and Marina Koshevaya, as Nitschke faded near the end to drop off the podium and place fourth.
In The Complete Book of the Olympics, David Wallechinsky tells Nitschke’s story, “At the 1977 European Championships, Carola Nitschke was awarded a gold medal in the 4 x 100 metre [medley relay].

In 1998 Nitschke became the first doped athlete to return her medals and ask that her name be removed from the record books.”
One other woman not in Montréal was East German Renate Vogel, who had set two world records in the 100 breaststroke in 1974 and that year also won the European Championship in both the 100 and 200 breast. But by the end of that year she was continually injured and tired of the training, and the various drugs she was required to take, so she quit swimming at the end of 1974, defected to West Germany in 1979, and later told the whole story of the East German swimming program and how they manipulated athletes and surreptitiously gave them performance-enhancing drugs (PEDs).

Fogh would compete in six Olympics, from 1960-72 for Denmark and in 1976 and 1984 for Canada, adding a bronze medal in 1984 in the Soling Class while representing Canada.
Lunde, making his Olympic début, was only 18-years-old, but would compete in four Olympics, also winning a silver medal in the Star Class in 1968. His family is one of the renowned in Olympic sailing history. His grandfather, Eugen Lunde, won a gold medal in the 1924 6-metre class, and his father and mother, Peder and Vibeke, won silver medals in the 1952 5.5 metre class. Peder, Jr.’s daughter, Jeannette, competed in Alpine skiing at the 1994 and 2000 Winter Olympics. His wife and sister-in-law also competed in Alpine skiing for Norway at the Olympics.

The opening heats were won by East Germany and Bulgaria, the latter of whom had captured silver at the 1975 World Championships with almost the same lineup that they brought to Montreal. These two nations also had the two best times overall in round one. In the final, however, the East Germans demonstrated the prowess that they had displayed at the World Championships and took gold with ease, over three seconds ahead of the Bulgarians. The Soviet Union, who had not seen a major international podium in the event since they won the 1972 European Championships, captured bronze.

For 2022, Morris was paired up with Rachel Homan, no stranger to Olympic competition herself, having represented Canada as skip of the 2018 women’s team. Also returning to compete for Olympic gold were 2018 silver medalists Jenny Perret and Martin Rios of Switzerland, and Norway’s Kristin Skaslien and Magnus Nedregotten, runners-up at the 2021 World Mixed Doubles Championships. Of the other doubles teams, Jenn Dodds and Bruce Mouat of Great Britain were considered a definite medal threat, based on their victory at the 2021 World Mixed Doubles Championship over Norway.
One doubles team who were overlooked as potential medalists in the run up to the Games were Stefania Constantini and Amos Mosaner of Italy, perhaps based on that country’s record as never having medaled at a World Mixed Doubles Championship, which were inaugurated in 2008. That oversight was unfortunate, because as the Olympic event unfolded, they soon proved themselves to be the class of the field. The Italian pair sailed through the round-robin in unblemished fashion, winning the majority of their games by fairly comfortable margins. The other favourites tried to keep pace behind them, but Switzerland struggled right out of the gate, losing their first three games, and defending gold medalists, Canada, stumbled near the end of the round-robin, losing their last two matches, one being to Australia, who had ironically been coached by Morris in the run up to the Olympics.
With the defending champions being eliminated from the medal round, Italy, Norway, Great Britain, and Sweden, represented by Almida de Val and Oskar Eriksson, were left to square off. In the semi-finals, Italy continued their winning ways by rolling over the Swedes 8-1, while Norway edged Great Britain 6-5 in a tight match. The bronze medal game turned out to be no contest for Sweden, as they handily defeated Great Britain 9-3. The gold medal match started well for Norway as they stole two points in the first end, but Italy soon took control, scoring 6 points over the next three ends, including a critical steal of three in the fourth, which allowed them to cruise home with an 8-3 win. This was the first ever Olympic medal in curling for Italy, and Constantini became the youngest person to win a gold medal in Olympic curling. The Italian duo were also only the fourth team in Olympic curling history to emerge undefeated in event competition.

Final placement was determined by a Majority Placement rule.  Thus, if a pair were ranked first by a majority of the judges, that pair was placed first overall, and the process was repeated for each place.  Ties were broken by a Subsequent Majority rule, i.e., if the pairs were ranked for the same position by the same number of judges, Majority Placement for the next higher position for each pair determined who was ranked higher.

The Protopopovs – Lyudmila Belousova and Oleg Protopopov – had won the gold medal in 1964 and 1968. They had been surpassed by younger Soviet pairs, notably Irina Rodnina and Aleksey Ulanov. Rodnina and Ulanov had won the last four European titles and were World Champions in 1970-71. They dominated the competition in Sapporo, winning both the short program and free skate over their teammates, Lyudmila Smirnova and Andrey Suraykin. But there is a bit more to that story. Rodnina was considered the stronger skater of her pair, and Ulanov, who was weary of her mocking him, became romantically involved with Smirnova. They would eventually marry and after 1972, Rodnina and Ulanov split as a pair skating couple. In Sapporo, knowing what was to come, Rodnina, who had once had strong romantic feelings for Aleksey, left the ice in tears after their free skating performance.
Irina Rodnina would soon begin skating with Aleksandr Zaytsev and together they would win the next two Olympic pairs gold medals, six World Championships, and seven European Championships. This would give Rodnina three consecutive Olympic pairs gold medals. She and Zaytsev would later marry, although they eventually divorced.

It differed from the men’s version in that there were three riders instead of four and the distance was 3,000 m instead of 4,000. Since the sport had been introduced to the World Championships in 2008, Great Britain had won the title every year except for 2010 and were considered not only the favorites, but in a league all of their own. Of the three riders in London, Joanna Rowsell had been to every World Championship, except in 2011, while Dani King and Laura Trott had joined the squad in 2011. The Australians had been the only nation to take the world title away from them and, although only Josephine Tomic remained from that trio, that nation was considered the most likely challenger to Britain at the Games.
Britain proved their dominance throughout the event, setting world records in every round of competition. The United States team, consisting of Sarah Hammer, Dotsie Bausch, Jennie Reed, had unexpectedly won a silver medal in the discipline at the 2011 World Championships and continued to surprise by posting a faster time than Australia in the qualifying heats. In the semi-finals the United States caused one of the biggest upsets in the cycling tournament by edging out Australia by just over eight one-hundredths of a second and stealing their spot in the gold medal match. Bausch was perhaps the star of the American team; a former runway model, she had abused drugs and suffered from anorexia for many years before turning her life around following a suicide attempt where she walked into highway traffic in the middle of the night. She took up cycling as part of her recovery and found moderate success as a professional road racer prior to shifting focus to track cycling and boosting the Americans’ performance abroad since 2009.
In the final Reed was replaced by Lauren Tamayo, in hopes that a fresh rider would give the Americans a chance at the gold, but it was to no avail. The British women posted their third world record time in the event, a blistering 3:14.051, and won the race by nearly six seconds, an incredible margin of victory for a gold medal match in the discipline. The bronze medal match was much closer, with the Canadians denying Australia a podium position by nearly two-tenths of a second. Notably, both teams posted faster times in this round than the Americans did in the final, but Canada would still have been just shy of four seconds slower than Great Britain.
After the final, inspired by the presence of Sir Paul McCartney in the velodrome, the crowd broke out into an impromptu version of “Hey Jude” in honour of the victorious British trio,

In the first round the 21-year-old Swiss Hansjörg Sumi, made a mighty jump of 117.0 m, taking the lead ahead of Jouko Törmänen from Finland and Austria’s Hubert Neuper. In fourth place, to everyone’s great surprise, was Steve Collins, a 15-year-old Ojibway Indian from Canada, a jumper totally unknown outside his homeland. Innauer was in sixth position, almost 9 points behind Sumi.
In the second round, Neuper was starting first of the favorites and was in a clear lead after a good jump of 114.5 m. Finland’s Jari Puikkonen, lying fifth after the first round, was in second position when his teammate Törmänen impressed with another 117.0 m jump, taking over the lead. First of the challengers was Innauer, but a jump of only 107.0 m placed him behind Puikkonen and outside the medals. Next was the leader after the first round, the Swiss Sumi. He could not duplicate his first jump and landed at 100.0 m, 17.0 m shorter than his first jump. Last to jump was the 15-year-old Collins, a jump of 108.0 m would put him in the bronze medal position. However, the young Collins could not control his nerves, as his 102.5 m dropped him from fourth to ninth.
Finland had fought back against the Austrian/East German dominance in ski jumping, winning gold and bronze. The Austrian team jumped well, placing second, fourth and fifth, but for the East Germans the Large Hill event was a great disappointment, their best Henry Glaß ending as a distant 11th.  Steve Collins won the Junior World Championships in Örnsköldsvik, Sweden five days later. Nine days after that he showed that his first jump in Lake Placid was not just luck, being the youngest ever winner of a World Cup ski jumping event in Lahti, Finland, four days before his 16th birthday.

The clear winner in this event, which only featured five competitors, was Markus Ramsauer of Austria. Ramsauer had already won a gold and a silver medal in the Geilo 1980 Paralympics, in the now defunct 2A class. In Innsbruck 1984, he would win two more medals (including one gold), although he would fail to finish the giant slalom.

With just one first place in the World Cup, a 10 km pursuit in Ruka, Finland, earlier this season under her belt, Ragnhild Haga was the unlikely winner in PyeongChang. The Sochi 10 km gold medalist Justyna Kowalczyk was competing in her fourth Olympcs but, at 35-years-of-age, was obviously past her prime and did not even compete in this event.
Haga, a former Junior and U23 World Champion, won the race with an impressive 20.3 seconds margin ahead of silver medalist Kalla, and 31.9 seconds ahead of third-placed Bjørgen. Clocking exactly the same time as Bjørgen, Krista Pärmäkoski from Finland joined her on the podium to as two bronze medals were awarded.
In a race contested under excellent conditions, with little wind, and bright sunshine, Marit Bjørgen crossed the finish line as the first of the favorites to set a mark. Then it looked like another triumph for skiathlon gold medalist, Charlotte Kalla but, at the 5 km mark, it became obvious that Haga, who started at a relatively modest pace, could actually outperform the two favorites. She took the lead between km 5 and 6, gradually increasing her lead. Pärmäkoski was in fifth or sixth place throughout the race, but a strong finish closed the gap to Bjørgen, equaling her time, and winning the second of her of three medals in PyeongChang. Diggins, still on third position at the last intermediate, lost five seconds to Bjørgen, and eight seconds to Pärmäkoski, to drop out of the medal positions. Nathalie von Siebenthal, from Switzerland, could repeat her remarkable sixth place from the skiathlon and Austrian Teresa Stadlober, who was to become a tragic figure in the 30 km, added another top ten finish.

The rules of all 1948 Olympic art competitions stated that “Works submitted must have been executed during the course of the XIII Olympiad, that is, after the 1st January, 1944, and must not have been entered for the Art Competition of any previous Olympiads..” This was cleary not the case for the gold medallist, Italian Giani Stùparich. His work, “La Grotta” (The Cave) was first published in 1933, although Stùparich later edited it several times. Stùparich is best known for his novel, “L’Isola” (The Island), which he wrote in 1942.

But he had no significant major titles since 2008, and was not considered a medal favorite. He would fail to make a fair mark in qualifying. The two favorites were Australia’s Mitch Watt and Britain’s Greg Rutherford, with Watt given a slight edge.
The lead in round one went to Britain’s Chris Tomlinson, who jumped 8.06 but that was his best mark and he would eventually finish sixth. On the second round, Rutherford took the lead with 8.21, a mark that would have been good enough for the gold medal, but he would better that with 8.31 in round four and win gold. Watt was only fourth after three jumps, having only one fair jump with 7.97 in round two, but he improved to 8.13 in round five and 8.16 in the final round to get silver. The bronze went to surprising American Will Claye. Claye was actually on the US team in the long and triple jump in London and was considered better in the triple. He would win silver in the triple jump five days later, the first such medal double since 1936, when Japan’s Naoto Tajima medalled in both events.
Rutherford’s victory came on the second night of athletics at the Olympic Stadium and it was a magic one for British fans. His best jump came at about the time that Jessica Ennis started her 800 metres to finish what would be her heptathlon gold medal. Later that evening, Mo Farah would win the 10,000 metres to give Great Britain three gold medals on a surreal Saturday night.
The long jumping performances were less than seen in recent years. Some of this was attributed to difficult, shifting winds, but also to the fact that there was no single dominant long jumper in 2012. Only Rutherford surpassed 27 feet, and only 14 of 60 attempts were past the 8-metre barrier, or just 26-3 in Imperial measure.

While also the 2005 World Champion, Kato had far from dominated the 2005/2006 season, with World Cup wins going to Jeremy Wotherspoon (2003 and 2004 World Champion), Lee Gang-Seok, Yu Fengtong, Dmitry Dorofeyev and Joey Cheek. The latter two skaters had also surprisingly finished 1-2 at the most recent World Sprint Championships, winning one 500 m race each.
After the first run, the winner already seemed certain. American Joey Cheek was the only skater to beat 35 seconds (34.82), and led with a huge margin of 4 tenths over Dmitry Dorofeyev. The fight for bronze was close, with Lee (35.34), Yuya Oikawa (35.35), Wotherspoon (35.37) and Yu (35.39) within 0.05 seconds of each other. World record holder Kato was back in 11th and out of medal contention.
The second run showed pretty much the same picture. Cheek was again the only one under 35 seconds (now with 34.94), and Dorofeyev consolidated his second place, despite being a bit slower than Lee. Cheek proved a popular Olympic champion, especially after he announced to give away his $25,000 award from the US Olympic Committee to charity (“Right to Play”, founded by Johann Olav Koss). Medals won by Dorofeyev and and Lee were the first speed skating medals for their countries since 1994 and 1992, respectively. Dorofeyev’s 2006 successes were a remarkable departure from his earlier results, having only a 1999 World Cup victory as a notable prior achievement.

These strengths were clearly visible at the end of the qualifying round, where six of the top seven competitors (the other being Aiko Uemura of Japan) were North American. The event was particularly significant for the Canadians who held Heil to be one of their best hopes in breaking their gold-medal drought in Olympics hosted in their country.
Some were worried that the finals might be delayed, or even canceled, as the weather worsened on the hill, but the skiers began on time, competing in intermittent rain and an increasingly soggy course. The event went as expected until American Michelle Roark, who had finished seventh in the qualifying round, crashed out and was soon followed in this regard by Richards and McPhie, leaving Bahrke as the front runner in the competition up to that point, followed by Uemura and Chloe Dufour-Lapointe of Canada. A great run by Heil placed her ahead of Bahrke by a slim margin, leaving only Kearney to challenge her for the gold. Kearney rose to the challenge and produced an amazing run, which left little doubt in the end that she had claimed victory in the event.

Azerbaijan’s Hacı Əliyev, the two-time World champion, had to drop down to 57 kg because his normal weight class (61 kg) was not on the Olympic programme and he found himself wrestling with Khinchegashvili, the reigning 57 kg world champion, in the quarter-finals. This match of two reigning World champions going head-to-head had Khinchegashvili narrowly winning the bout 5-3, but Aliyev wrestled back through the repêchage to win one of the bronze medals.
The second bronze was won by Rahimi who recovered from his loss to Higuchi to pin Bonne in the bronze medal match with about a minute left on the clock.

At the start of 1964 not one of the four men who win medals in Tokyo could even be considered as favourites to be selected for their national Olympic teams. As often happens one of the most important bouts happened in the first round when Artur Olech put out European Championship medallist [Stefan Panayotov] of Bulgaria on a split decision. Olech comfortably reached the semi-finals  and was joined by Fernando Atzori of Italy and Bob Carmody of the USA. The fourth quarter final was a memorable affair albeit for the wrong reasons. Stanislav Sorokin of the Soviet Union was awarded the fight when Jo Dong-Gi was disqualified for holding his head too low. The Korean refused to leave the ring and sat down in his corner for nearly an hour before he eventually left. Sorokin could not benefit further from this decision because he was forced to withdraw from his semi-final with Olech due to an eye injury. Atzori won his semi-final on a 4-1 judges decision against Carmody then won another 4-1 decision over Olech in the final despite being hampered by a cut eye. The Italian went on to a professional career and held the European flyweight title between 1967 and 1972 and again in 1973. Bob Carmody’s life ended just three years after his Olympic appearance when, serving with the US Cavalry in Vietnam, he was killed when his company was ambushed by the Vietcong.

The Canadians, meanwhile, were the defending Olympic champions, and two returned to the 1996 Games to help defend the crown: Darren Barber and Andy Crosby. With many distinguished rowers on each crew, the event promised to be an exciting one, but the Dutch squad was in control for the entire tournament, qualifying with the fastest time in the opening round and winning gold by a comfortable margin of almost two seconds. Among their lineup were three Olympic medalists in the double sculls: Ronald Florijn, champion in 1988, Henk Jan Zwolle, who earned bronze in 1992, and Nico Rienks, who had been both of their partners. The United States had won the other heat in round one, albeit in a slower time than the Canadians had finished in the Dutch heat, but it was the Germans who put up the strongest fight against the Netherlands in the final and thus earned silver. Somewhat more surprising was Russia’s performance, as they stole bronze from the Canadians by a margin of nearly a second and earned their first Olympic rowing medal as an independent nation (or, at least, not as the Soviet Union) since Mart Kuusik had won bronze in the single sculls in 1912 (and Kuusik was ethnically Estonian).

The 2018 bronze medalist had clocked three sub-34-second races in the season, and set an unofficial world record at the Tomaszów-Mazowiecki World Cup, opening in 9.32 seconds. Gao, however, had plenty of contenders to fight off. Reigning World Champion Laurent Dubreuil was also leading the World Cup standings, and two of Japan’s entries – Wataru Morishige and Tatsuya Shinhama – had also won races earlier in the season. Missing from the field was world record holder Pavel Kulizhnikov. The three-time World Champion had had a poor season and did not qualify for the strong ROC team in this event.
As he had not raced in all World Cup races, Gao was the first of the favorites to start, and he immediately set a tough target for the others. Following a 9.42 opening, he bested the Olympic Record with 34.32. In the tenth pair, 2018 silver medalist Cha Min-Gyu recorded the best full lap of the field (24.75), which landed him at 34.39, second behind. After him, many the outsiders for a medal fell short – Michalski (35.52), Arefyev (34.56), Murakami (34.57). Only in the penultimate pair did Morishige come close to the leading times, 34.49, guaranteeing Gao a medal. The final race between Dubreuil and Shinhama then saw the Canadian controversially false start. Replays showed no signs of a false start, while earlier Gao had not been completely still. Possibly affected, Shinhama then stumbled in the first metres, throwing away his shot at a medal. Dubreuil did continue at full pace, but with 34.52 just fell out of the podium.
With Gao’s gold, Cha’s silver and Morishige’s bronze medal, all the medalists were from Asia, the second time this had occurred, the first time being in Vancouver 2010.

Both were back in London and both made the final. Phelps’ best stroke was the butterfly and he had won the 100 and 200 butterfly at the 2011 World Championships, as he had done at the 2004 and 2008 World Championships. But he had earlier faltered in the 200 fly in London, winning “only” silver behind South African Chad le Clos.
The final saw the early lead taken by Čavić and German Steffen Deibler, with Phelps seventh at 50 metres, leading only Le Clos. But the final lap was all Phelps as he finished in 51.21 to three-peat in the event, with Le Clos also coming on strong to finish in a second-place tie with Russian Yevgeny Korotyshkin. Fourth-place was also a dead-heat between Deibler and Čavić.
For Phelps this was his final individual gold medal of a vaunted Olympic career. It was his 11th individual gold medal and 17th gold medal in all – he would later win #18 in the 4×100 medley relay. His three-peat in this event followed a similar three-peat he had just completed in the 200 IM, making him the first man to three-peat in a swimming event at the Olympics, and only the third person ever, following Australian Dawn Fraser in the 100 freestyle in 1956-64, and Hungarian Krisztina Egerszegi in the 100 backstroke in 1988-96.

The 35 year old Norwegian had shown excellent early season form, 2 wins and a second place from 4 World Cup sprint races, and expectations were high that he could add to his tally of nine Olympic medals.
Just as in the women’s sprint event a day earlier, this race too produced a major surprise. Competitors started at 30 second intervals, and this proved to benefit those with an early start. Klemen Bauer of Slovenia started second and was the early leader in a time of 24:25.2 – this would eventually be good enough for 4th place. Croatian Jakov Fak took over the lead with a time of 24:21.8, but this was soon surpassed by Vincent Jay of France in a time of 24:07.8. As the weather conditions then deteriorated out on the course, the favourites struggled with their shooting in the wind and driving snow. Bjørndalen’s chances ended when he missed three shots at his first visit to the range and he had to be content with 17th place. Only his compatriot, Emil Hegle Svendsen mastered the conditions to finish with the silver medal in a time of 24:20.0, although he too started early (10th) and missed one shot on the course. A clear indication that the competition became somewhat of a lottery is the fact that only two of the first fifteen starters placed lower than fifteenth at the finish.
Of the three medallists only Emil Hegle Svendsen’s appearance on the podium could have been predicted with any confidence. Vincent Jay had been a solid performer on the World Cup circuit but had previously won only a single race, at the pre-Olympic test event at Whistler in March 2010, and had only one top ten finish in the season prior to the Olympics. Jakov Fak was ranked just outside the world’s top sixty although even this high a ranking was largely gained by a single astonishing performance at the 2009 World Championship where he also won a completely unexpected bronze medal.
This was Croatia’s first ever Winter Games medal although by summer Fak had already transferred his allegiance to Slovenia.

It was the underdog American, 17-year-old Red Gerard, who had won the 2017 World Cup, who came back came after a shaky run in the first heat of the finals. His final run saw him using features of the course that were ignored by other riders, and on his second jump he did a double cork off the quarterpipe takeoff, instead of using the kicker that most riders were using. Gerard landed a perfect backside triple cork 1440 on the final jump earning a score of 87.16 points to capture the gold medal.

Aleksandr Maseykov and Dmitry Dovgalyonok, now representing Belarus, were the defending Olympic champions, but had had more success in the C-2 200 in recent years. Romania’s Gheorghe Andriev and Grigore Obreja, meanwhile, were the 1994 World Champions, while Bulgaria’s Martin Marinov and Blagovest Stoyanov were the 1992 Olympic and 1994 World bronze medalists. Finally there was Nicolae Juravschi and Victor Reneischi, who had won the C-2 500 and 1000 for the Soviet Union at the 1988 Games, but had been denied the opportunity to defend their crown under the banner of the Soviet successor “Unified Team” (Juravschi, however, was eventually given the chance to compete for Romania). At the 1996 Olympics, however, they were representing Moldova together and were eager to race once more.
Hungary, Moldova, and Romania won their opening heats, while Bulgaria came in third in Juravschi and Reneischi’s heat, behind Andreas Dittmer and Gunar Kirchbach of Germany, the 1993 and 1995 World bronze medalists. Maseykov and Dovgalyonok, meanwhile, were relegated to the repêchage by Horváth and Kolonics. Moldova was runner-up to Romania in the first semi-final heat, while Hungary, Germany, Belarus, and Bulgaria finished in that order in the other heat. Hungary led for much of the final and, although they were eventually overtaken by Moldova, they managed a comeback in the last few meters and won the gold medal by 0.036 seconds. Thus Juravschi and Reneischi took silver while Romania came in soon after for bronze, having staved off a challenge from Germany by 0.424 seconds. This was Horváth and Kolonics’ second medal of the regatta, as they had taken bronze in the C-2 1000 the day before.

A United States’ team was also entered but did not take part. In various sources over the years, very different results are seen for this sport, despite the small number of entrants. The best study of the problem was done by Ture Widlund, a founding member of the International Society of Olympic Historians (ISOH), who published his work, “Dragkamp vid Olympiska Spelen i Paris 1900,” in Idrott Historia och Samhälle in 1981. His conclusion is quite unmistakable that only the two teams mentioned actually competed, with the Scandanavian team defeating the French team. Both the Journal des Sports and The New York Herald Tribune (Paris edition) noted however, that after the competition had ended, the American team pulled against the Swedish/Danish team. Journal des Sports wrote (translated), “The Americans wanted to tug in spiked shoes. Protests were raised, whereupon they took off their shoes and tugged barefoot, which gave them a certain advantage. The first round was won by the Americans. In the second round some Americans, who did not belong to the team, grabbed the rope to help their countrymen, who were tired. An unpleasant incident now followed, which nearly ended in a common fight. Officials intervened and brought an end to the unpleasant scene.” The New York Times noted, “The remaining event, the tug-of-war, was won by a Swedish team against a French team, the Americans not competing.”

In the final, he prevailed in extra time by defeating his opponent Yang Yung-Wei from Chinese Taipei based on penalization for inactivity with Ippon.

They had to watch as Russian Aleksey Bondarenko crashed and fell on both vaults, receiving the remarkably low score of 4.550. Li also fell on his first vault, which ended his medal hopes, and he would place only seventh. Deferr performed two solid vaults and took the lead with 9.737. Romanian Marian Drăgulescu opened with his signature move, which bore his name, and scored 9.900, the highest score awarded at an Olympics or World Championships since 1995. On his second vault, however, he overshot his landing, going over the penalty stripe and touched down both hands to the mat. His score for that vault was 9.325, which seemed unusually high given that automatic deductions were required for his faults, and his average score of 9.612 brought him the bronze medal, trailing Deferr and Latvia’s Jevgēņijs Saproņenko.
Canada’s Kyle Shewfelt was fourth with 9.599, and they immediately protested after Drăgulescu’s second vault, stating that his score could not be that high with automatic deductions. There were five judges with the high and low scores eliminated. The other scores were required to be within 0.2 points of one another if the total was over 9.0. This was not true for Drăgulescu’s second vault, but the Canadian protest was brushed off by FIG Technical Director Adrian Stoica, who was also from Romania. Canada then lodged a protest with the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS), but quickly withdrew it, realizing it had little chance of success.

Switzerland emerged victorious and Poland settled for bronze. Unsurprisingly, the Swiss crew lost to the Italians again in the final, this time by a wider margin as they had not received the opportunity to rest that the Italian team had been afforded.

American Harry Chamberlin took the lead in the dressage followed by his teammate Eddie Argo, with Pahud de Mortanges placed third. The cross-country and steeplechase phase was won by American Earl Thomson, and moved into the overall lead, with Pahud de Mortanges second in jumping and also overall. Chamberlin was far back in this phase, and Argo even further behind. Argo came back to win the jumping phase quite comfortably, with only a minor time penalty, but Pahud de Mortanges placed second in jumping to defend his gold medal.

Zirzow was fastest in the semi-finals, perhaps due to the challenge presented by Mihoreanu, while Korshunova and Kamińska-Eichler took the other heats. In the final, Zirzow was the dominant canoeist and managed to take the title away from the Soviet Union for the first time in over two decades by a margin of over two seconds. Korshunova, in turn, had nearly two seconds separating her from those contesting for bronze: Mihoreanu, Kamińska-Eichler, and Hungary’s Klára Rajnai, a 1975 World bronze medalist in the K-4 500. This trio battled to the line and seemed to cross at the same time, but a photo finish confirmed that Rajnai had won the bronze medal 0.15 seconds ahead of Kamińska-Eichler and 0.39 in front of Mihoreanu. Rajnai’s third-place finish was not her only one of the day either: she also took home silver in the K-2 500, while Zirzow went on to win bronze in the same event.

Dermott Lennon, the Irishman who had won the 2002 world title missed the Games as his gold medal winning horse, Liscalgot, had suffered an injury in 2003 that would eventually end her career. The same fate befell another top contender, For Pleasure, the mount of Germany’s Marcus Ehning had to be withdrawn shortly before the Games when it too fell lame. A different reason was responsible for the non-appearance of the top German Meredith Michaels-Beerbaum, her horse Shutterfly tested positive for the sedative hydroxylpromazine at the World Cup final earlier in the year and the German federation did not consider her for Athina. Of those that reached Athina, the Brazilian Rodrigo Pessoa and his “superstar” horse Baloubet du Rouet had been consistently amongst the world’s best for nearly a decade, German riders had finished 1-2-3 in the 2003 European Championships and Jos Lansink, in his fifth Olympics, although this time representing Belgium instead of the Netherlands, was also considered amongst those in strong contention for medals.
A single qualifying round held on 22 August was added to individual results from the team competition, those riding solely as individuals competed over the same course with the top 45 competitors moving into the final. The rule stating that only three from each nation could qualify for the final proved costly for the European champion Christian Ahlmann of Germany, he finished 19th but only fourth German.
Qualifying scores were not carried through to the final which consisted of two rounds of jumping over courses of increased difficulty. Only two riders produced faultless first rounds, Jessica Chesney-Kürten of Ireland and the veteran Briton Nick Skelton. Skelton was a sentimental favourite, having retired in 2000 following a fall in which he suffered a double fracture of his C1 vertebrae. By 2002 the injury had sufficiently healed that surgeons were able to declare him fit to resume his career. The outsider Daniel Meech of New Zealand placed third with a single time penalty but no less than 28 riders were within eight penalties of the leaders.
For the second round riders went in the order of their positions with the leaders going last. Pessoa was the first rider to go clear, adding zero to his first round score of eight. As those around him produced disappointing performances he moved up the leaderboard until the entry into the arena of Ireland’s Cian O’Connor. O’Connor and Waterford Crystal jumped impeccably and stayed on their round one score of four faults. With only the last three combinations to go O’Connor still led with Pessoa and the USA’s Chris Kappler jointly in second. Meech and Skelton produced identical rounds, knocking three fences down and being slightly over the allowed time. This guaranteed a gold medal to Ireland, a nation that prides itself on its’ horsemanship, for the first time in Olympic equestrianism. The only question was whether it would go O’Connor or to Chesney-Kürten. In the event Chesney-Kürten would have a disastrous round, knocking five fences over and O’Connor would win the gold. A jump-off for the silver medal was decided in favour of Pessoa when Royal Kaliber, Chris Kappler’s mount, pulled up lame.
On 8 October 2004 it was announced that a urine sample taken from Waterford Crystal had tested positive for prohibited substances. The substances were later revealed to be zuclopenthixol and fluphenazine, anti-psychotic drugs used to treat schizophrenia in humans. O’Connor requested that the “B” sample be tested but it was reported missing, believed stolen, in transit between Medication Control Programme Central Laboratory in Paris and the Horseracing Forensic Laboratory in Newmarket, England. On the day that the news of the theft became public, the offices of the Irish Equestrian Federation were broken into and some documents taken although no link to the case has ever been proven. A blood sample taken at the same time as the urine sample was later tested and the results confirmed the previous findings. The explanation given by O’Connor was that the horse suffered a fetlock injury a month prior to the Games and his veterinary surgeon recommended the horse be given a mild sedative to prevent him becoming upset, which might have caused further injury. Although the FEI inquiry absolved O’Connor of deliberate doping he was stripped of his medal, his Olympic results were annulled and he received a three-month ban from competition. Rodrigo Pessoa of Brazil inherited the gold medal, Chris Kappler (USA) moved up to silver and Germany’s Marco Kutscher took the bronze.

The standings from the ongoing downhill World Cup saw Sofia Goggia, gold medallist from PyeongChang four years earlier, in the lead after winning four of the six races contested. She won at Lake Louise (twice), Val-d’Isère, and Cortina d’Ampezzo. The other two races had been won by Lara Gut-Behrami (Zauchensee) and Corinne Suter (Garmisch-Partenkirchen), who placed second in the standings. Goggia had also won two downhill Crystal Globes since the last Olympics, in 2018 and 2021 and, in-between, Nicole Schmidhofer had won in 2019 and Suter in 2020.
Suter was also the reigning 2021 World Champion while Ilka Štuhec was the 2019 champion. Schmidhofer was unable to compete in Beijing as she was still recovering from a knee injury, as was Breezy Johnson, who finished second in the first three World Cup downhills of the season but suffered a knee injury in a training run in Cortina d’Ampezzo on 21 January 2022. Only two days later, in the Super G on the same slope, Goggia had a fall that also caused a knee injury, which led her to withdraw from the Super G in Beijing. She competed in the downhill, as did Štuhec, but they both still struggled with injuries. Of the three scheduled training runs only two were held after one was cancelled due to snow fall. The best times were set by Priska Nufer, who did not compete in this race but started in the Alpine Combined instead, and Joana Hählen, with 2021 World Championship runner-up Kira Weidle, finishing second on both occasions.
The race, postponed for 30 minutes due to wind, was opened by Elena Curtoni and she held the lead until her compatriot Nadia Delago (bib number 11) overtook her by 0.32 seconds. When Goggia (bib number 13) finished her run another 0.41 seconds faster, Italy had a 1-2-3, but Suter (bib number 15) ended the Italian hopes as she set the pace with 1:31.87 with only two more skiers from the top group to come. The two were Weidle who finished fourth, and Gut-Behrami, who after her Super G victory four days earlier, finished back in 16th place.
Corinne Suter gave Switzerland its sixth Olympic gold medal in this event. As Beat Feuz won the men’s downhill, it meant both downhill golds of these Games went to Switzerland. The last time Switzerland did that was exactly 50 years ago with Marie-Theres Nadig and Bernhard Russi (the builder of this slope in Beijing) at Sapporo. Suter won the race with an average speed of 105.96 km/h and 4.70 metres ahead of Goggia. On the manufacturer side, Head won another gold medal while Atomic took silver and bronze.

This was the largest class in Tokyo sailing with 44 sailors coming to the start line. Bouwmeester and Rindom got off to slow starts and after four races stood fifth and third, respectively. Rindom moved into the lead after the sixth race although she had not won a race but had consistent top finishes. After the eighth race, which Rindom finally won, Bouwmeester was in seventh place, partly due to a black flag disqualification in race seven, but she won the ninth race and moved up to second behind Rindom, who had a commanding lead by then. Still in medal contention were Belgian Emma Plasschaert and Sweden’s Josefin Olsson, who were third and fourth, respectively.
In the 10th race Rindom did not finish and her last place points caused her to have to count her only earlier poor finish. She still led but Bouwmeester had closed the gap and Olsson was third going into the medal race. Olsson won the medal race to win the silver medal, pushing Bouwmeester, who placed sixth, back to bronze as Plasschaert missed the podium. Rindom was seventh in the medal race but still held on for the gold medal. She struggled when her self-bailer did not work well as it was clogged with seaweed.
Bouwmeester completed a full set of medals in the event, as she had won silver at London in 2012 in addition to her gold medal at Rio.

His heat times were not remarkable but he was unpressed in both rounds.  Frank Jarvis and Walter Tewksbury, however, both posted a new world record of 10.8 in winning their heats.
In the heats of this event, the French starter Meier, proved incompetent and was soon replaced by the well-known British starter George F. Sandford.  The start of the final was described as very even, but at the halfway mark, Duffey had opened up a lead of a metre.  Suddenly he fell to the track, having pulled a muscle badly.  The others finished close together, about one yard separating the three finishers, but Frank Jarvis took the title in 11.0 seconds.
Duffey was the greatest sprinter since Bernie Wefers.  In 1902, he ran 100 yards in 9.6 seconds and he won several IC4A, AAU, and AAA championships, but his name is not to be found in the record books.  In 1905, he was declared a professional by AAU president James Sullivan, and Sullivan ordered all Duffey’s marks expunged from the records.  Duffey’s crime, according to Charles Paddock, was that he chose to wear running shoes made by an English company, and not by the New York company with which Sullivan was affiliated.

Winner of each pool advanced to semi-finals.,na,"Hungary had won the gold medal in both 2000 and 2004, but since the Athens Olympics, had made a habit of finishing second in major championships, mostly to Serbia. Serbia & Montenegro won the 2005 World Championships over Hungary, and in 2006 Serbia defeated Hungary in the final of both the World Cup and the European Championships. In 2007 Hungary again placed second at the World Championships, this time losing in the final to Croatia. Serbia was the favorite in Beijing, having won the World Superleague Final earlier in the year.
In group play, Hungary won Group A, while the United States surprisingly won Group B, advancing both teams directly to the semi-finals. There they were joined by Serbia, who defeated Croatia in one quarter-final, and Montenegro, who defeated Spain in the other. Obviously the remnants of Yugoslavia were still top notch in water polo. Hungary defeated Montenegro 11-9, in one semi-final, while in the other, the United States surprised Serbia, winning 10-5. The final was close for three quarters, with Hungary leading 9-8 at the halftime break. The USA scored early in the third quarter to equalize at 9-9, but Hungary then put the match away with five straight goals, before the US added a meaningless final goal with just under two minutes remaining, as Hungary won the gold medal, 14-10.
For Hungary this was their ninth gold medal in Olympic water polo, all by their men, and their 15th medal in all. From 1924-80 they had won medals at 12 consecutive Olympics. The United States won their ninth Olympic water polo medal, but other than the unusual 1904 Olympics, none of these were gold. Serbia won the bronze in Beijing, which was the 10th medal won by Yugoslavia (7), Serbia & Montenegro (2), or Serbia (1).
In a preliminary round match against China, Serbia’s Aleksandar Šapić became the third Olympic player to score nine goals in one match, after Hungarian János Németh in 1932, and Yugoslav Zoran Janković in  1968. Šapić was Serbia’s top player and had led the Olympic tournament in scoring in both 2000 and 2004, but was not available for the semi-final match against the USA in 2008, having hurt his knee, he returned to Serbia for surgery. The leading scorer in the 2008 men’s tournament was Italy’s Alessandro Calcaterra with 27 goals. This was the fourth highest scoring Olympic tournament ever, trailing Manuel Estiarte (ESP) and Nicolas van der Voet (NED), with 33 in 1984 and 1968, respectively; Eraldo Pizzo (ITA) with 29 in 1968; and equalling Estiarte, who also scored 27 in 1988.

The US led from the start although Catherine Pomales-Scott pulled Jamaica even at the halfway mark. Jones ran the third for the US in 49.46 and put the US ahead for good, with anchor runner LaTasha Colander-Richardson winning by five metres. Jamaica, Russia, Nigeria, and Australia fought it out for the other medals, with only a few metres separating them, Jamaica getting silver, and Russia the bronze. In 2007 Marion Jones admitted to having used performance-enhancing drugs (PEDs) at the time of the 2000 Olympics and her records and performances from that year were stricken by the IAAF.

The heats saw a few surprises with world championship silver medalists Germany and potential medal winners Great Britain, who elected to rest some of their best swimmers, eliminated.
Although France led after the first leg of the final, it was the performance of double medley champion Steph Rice who was chasing her 3rd gold of the Games that proved decisive, and without a weak link in the chain the Australians pulled away from the field to victory. The winning team shattered the world record by nearly six seconds with the 2nd, 3rd and 4th place teams also ducking well below the record as well.

In the final the Unifieds were second after two legs, trailing Sweden, as Anders Holmertz moved them ahead with the second-fastest split ever, 1:46.16. The Unified Team, all Russians, moved marginally ahead at the last exchange, as Yevgeny Sadovy prepared to swim anchor for them. Sadovy came home over 3½ seconds ahead of Sweden, as the Unified Team set a world record of 7:11.95, better the USA mark of 7:12.51 from Seoul. Sweden hung on for silver.

A bigger shock came in the semi-finals when the Koreans upset Italy largely through the effort of their top man, Gu Bon-Gil. They would have expected to face World Champions Russia in the final but this was not to be as the Russians fell in a close and exciting contest to the lower ranked Romanians.
The gold medal contest was also expected to be a close fought affair but instead turned into the most one sided match of the whole event.  Korea had early successes and continued to build their lead throughout the match. They went on to win a conclusive 45-26 victory over the European opponents. This was the first time an Asian nation had won an Olympic men’s team title in fencing.
Italy rebounded from their defeat against Korea to beat Russia for bronze despite being punished for overenthusiastic celebrations at one point in the contest.

However, at the Tokyo Olympics, gold went to Hamada on home soil, the first for Japan in this division since 2004. In the semi-final it took her only 1:23 min to throw Wagner with an Ude-hishigi-juji-gatame (back-lying perpendicular arm bar) for an Ippon (full point). In the final against Malonga, the end of the fight came after only 1:09 min. A misjudged attempt by Malonga allowed Hamada to surprise her with counter-attack scoring an Ippon for a Kuzure-kami-shiho-gatame (broken upper four quarter hold down). Both finallists got that far after winning all their previous contests by Ippon, with Hamada defeating four top ten seeds.
Wagner returned to claim bronze. She held on to a Waza-ari (half-point) scored after 1:50 min until the end of the fight against the Cuban Kaliema Antomarchi. Several of the highly ranked athletes like the Dutch Guusje Steenhuis, bronze medallist at the 2021 World Championships, were eliminated early and did not even make it into the top eight.

One thing that did not change was their results, as they were unbeaten since 1994, having won 21 consecutive competitions. The ice dance competition in Nagano was very exciting, …, well, actually, not really. Grishchuk and Platov won easily over their teammates Anzhelika Krylova and Oleg Ovsyanikov.

The Dave Murray Downhill, a difficult and fast course with 37 corners, several steeps, flats, drop-offs, compressions and long turns, like “Coaches Corner”, was prepared perfectly. Due to poor weather the first training run on 10 February was halted after 42 racers. The second training run one day later on 11 February was the only practice run for all competitors and saw Austrian Michael Walchhofer leading. To save the course the last training run on 12 February was cancelled. Originally the race start was scheduled for Saturday, 13 February at 12 noon, but the race was delayed very early in the morning due to snow in the higher part of the track and due to rain and fog in the lower part. Eventually warm temperatures forced a postponement until Monday, 15 February at 10:30.
The favorites for the race were the current World Cup leader in downhill, winner of two World Cup downhills in the season and fastest in the first training run Didier Cuche, the Austrian Michael Walchhofer (Downhill World Cup winner in 2008-09), and the locals Manuel Osborne-Paradis, Robbie Dixon (placed second in both trainings), and Erik Guay. Cuche broke his right thumb after a fall in the last World Cup race before the Olympics, but recovered right before the Games. The Canadians had the advantage that there were no Pre-Olympics so they had had the possibility to practice exclusively for two years since the course was modified. The last World Cup downhill race on the course, before the slight changes, was held on 25 February 1995. Only one of the downhillers came back 15 years later to compete at the Olympics, Patrik Järbyn who placed 50th in 1995. The next three tries to hold a downhill race were all cancelled due to weather issues (1996-98). Both the gold medalist from 2006 Antoine Dénériaz, as well as the bronze medalist Bruno Kernen, retired in 2007 and the very best downhiller of the last decade, Austrian Hermann Maier, retired just before the 2009-10 season. Also unable to compete was the reigning world champion, Canada’s John Kucera, who broke his right tibia in the World Cup Super G race at Lake Louise in November.
On race day the weather was cloudy and the temperature was about 0°, with one cold night enough to make the course hard, rough, and icy, so the race could be started. The FIS official, assistant referee, and former Olympic competitor Helmuth Schmalzl was the course setter. The first top time was set by the French David Poisson who came up with starting number 3 and a very close and thrilling race began. The first of the top favorites was Bode Miller with bib number 8. He topped the times of Poisson, leading by 0.97 seconds at the second intermediate mark at around 50 seconds of the run after the )Toilet Bowl). At the finish line Miller took the lead by 0.42 seconds. The first of the top group was Norwegian Aksel Lund Svindal with bib number 16, who lost time in the first part of the course and after the )Toilet Bowl) was 0.79 seconds behind Miller. But an excellent race in the middle section and final sections enabled Svindal to overtake Miller by only 0.02 seconds. Didier Défago started a few racers later. He equaled the top time of Miller at the first intermediate mark and raced a next to perfect downhill from the beginning to the end. At the last intermediate he was 0.03 seconds in front of Svindal and at the finish Défago took the lead by 0.07 seconds. The next favorite to start was Didier Cuche in position 22. Cuche also topped the times of Défago at the first two intervals, but lost time in the middle section, and would eventually finish sixth, leaving the medals to Défago, Svindal, and Miller in that order. Défago who won at Kitzbühel and Wengen last season, was a surprise winner, but not overly so, although he only qualified for the Swiss team at the last minute, when he bumped out Tobias Grünenfelder and Patrick Küng in the last training run to qualify as the fourth Swiss competitor.
The first five finishers represented five different countries and skied on three different products. Défago won with Rossignol; Svindal, Mario Scheiber, and Guay used Atomic; while Miller trusted Head. Twenty-two years after Pirmin Zurbriggen won in Calgary, Switzerland again won downhill gold in Canada. As a tribute to this win the Swiss racing suits were designed in the same style as in 1988, so Défago won the race in the same red and white outfit that Zurbriggen wore. The first major alpine skiing decision at the 2010 Winter Olympics ended with good luck. A course worker struggled and fell on the left side of the finishing straight. He was not able to leave the piste before the Australian Craig Branch came down with maximum speed. Luckily Branch had chosen to ride on the right side.

Benvenuti won four bouts in Rome by unanimous decision to make the final against the Soviet Yury Radonyak, a relative unknown. Benvenuti knocked down Radonyak in the first round, but although the Soviet came back strongly, he would lose a majority decision, 4-1. For his victory, Benvenuti was awarded the Val Barker Trophy as the best boxer at the Rome Olympics. Benvenuti then turned professional and in 1967 defeated Emile Griffith to win the world welterweight title. He lost a re-match against Griffith, but they fought again in March 1968, with Benvenuti winning the rubber match. He then held the world title through November 1970 before losing it to Carlos Monzon. Benvenuti retired after losing a re-match to Monzon in May 1971, finishing with a career professional record of 82 wins, 7 losses, and 1 draw. He is considered by many boxing experts as Italy’s greatest ever fighter. After his boxing career ended he became a businessman and sports commentator, and then in 1995 travelled to India, renouncing the material world to volunteer at Mother Teresa’s Hospice.

The early leader of the final was East Germany’s Roswitha Beier, who turned first, with six other swimmers in a blanket for second, while America’s best, Deena Deardurff, was last after a poor start. Beier maintained her lead until 10 metres from the wall when Aoki shot past to win the gold medal with another world record of 1:03.34. Beier held on for silver, with Gyarmati taking bronze.

Hargitay and Strachan were expected to be challenged by Tim McKee, silver medalist in this event in 1972. The opening butterfly leg of the final was led by the third American, Steve Furniss, but Strachan then opened a two-second lead on his strongest leg, the backstroke. Strachan later noted, “I knew I had the weakest breaststroke out there, so I felt I had to have a lead at the end of the backstroke.” And on the third leg, the breaststroke, McKee took back the lead, just over ½-second ahead of Strachan, only to see Strachan race home in the freestyle 100 in under a minute and claim the gold medal in world record time, 4:32.68. McKee settled for a second consecutive silver, while Soviet Andrey Smirnov surprised a tiring Hargitay to win bronze.

In the semis, Kopasz first set an Olympic best time and then, a couple of minutes later, Pimenta lowered it, which made their battle in the final one to be anticipated.
Kopasz was desperate from the start, bursting out of the blocks to push Pimenta for the lead. The rest of the field were happy to sit back and wait. Experienced campaigners like Dostal doubted the two leaders could keep up the pace for the entire 1000 metres, but he was wrong as Kopasz won, beating Pimenta, who finished third, with Varga, who was widely expected to challenge for gold, settling for silver, and Schopf fourth.

Voigt handed over as the leader, ahead of Sweden (0.5 seconds) and Italy (1.5 seconds). On the second leg, Vanessa Hinz had to reload twice for the last shot of the standing shooting and dropped to fourth place. Kristina Reztsova was first at the second exchange for the ROC with Italy’s Dorothea Wierer in second place.
Despite reloading four times, Hanna Öberg took the lead on the third leg. Italy’s youngest competitor, Samuela Comola, held on to second place. Svetlana Mironova had to go a penalty loop and dropped to third place. Germany started in fourth place, 45.9 seconds behind. Franziska Preuß, who could not compete for about two months prior to the Games due to an injury and COVID-19 infection, maintained their fourth place.
Elvira Öberg started the anchor leg with a lead of 26 seconds, and the Swede secured the gold medal, reloading just once in the final standing shooting. Federica Sanfilippo for Italy lost almost 90 seconds to the top teams and fell out of the medal ranking, finishing fifth. Uliana Nigmatullina had to reload just once, and took silver for the ROC. Olympic champion Denise Herrmann, Germany’s final runner, could never close the gap but was happy with bronze.
Heavy favourites Norway lost all chances early in the race, when their second runner, Tiril Eckhoff had to go two penalty loops and added 1:40 to Norway’s deficit, which was too much for the last two competitors to claw back.

Vlasov came to Rome as the favorite, where he was challenged by American Jim Bradford, the 1952 heavyweight silver medalist, and Norb Schemansky, the 1952 middle-heavyweight gold medalist. Bradford and Vlasov tied in the press with 180.0 kg, with Schemansky at 170.0 kg. Everyone else was well behind and the medals were settled if all three made a lift in the remaining two phases. Vlasov moved ahead after the snatch, lifting 155.0 kg, with both Bradford and Schemansky snatching 150.0 kg. Vlasov opened with a clean & jerk of 185.0 kg on his first attempt, but then improved to 195.0 kg and finally a stunning world record of 202.5 kg, the first legal lift over 200 kg. This lift world record gave him a world record total of 537.5 kg for the gold medal.
Vlasov returned in 1964 at Tokyo where he was upset by his teammate, Leonid Zhabotinsky. Schemansky competed at four Olympics, winning a medal each time – heavyweight silver in 1948, middle-heavyweight gold in 1952, and heavyweight bronzes in 1960-64, which made him the first weightlifter to win four Olympic medals.

The field included 2010 Olympic champion Marcus Hellner of Sweden and reigning World Champion, the Swiss Dario Cologna. However, both had recently been plagued by injuries and health problems. Therefore, home favorite Aleksandr Legkov and Norway’s Petter Northug were counted among the potential winners. 
Martin Johnsrud Sundby of Norway led a large group of skiers at the half way mark. A group of only four – Cologna, Hellner, Sundby and Russian Maksim Vylegzhanin – were in the lead approaching the final uphill stage. Hellner made an effort to break away from the quartet on the final climb, but was unsuccessful. Since none of the skiers could establish a decisive lead, it came down to a sprint to the finishing line, Cologna managing to win the gold, beating Hellner by only 0.4 sec. A second behind, Sundby, who had done much of the donkey work by frequently leading the race, took the bronze with Vylegzhanin missing the medals by just 0.1 sec.
In May 2016 WADA (World Anti-Doping Agency) commissioned a report, the McLaren Report, to look into allegations of systematic Russian doping and a cover-up to avoid positives at the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics. The report was released in two parts, in July and December 2016, and confirmed the allegations. In 2017 the IOC formed a commission to investigate this, headed by IOC Member Dennis Oswald, and usually referred to as the Oswald Commission. In late October 2017 the Oswald Commission began to release its findings. On 9 November 2017, the fourth-place finisher in this event, Maksim Veglyzhanin, was implicated by the Oswald Commission and was disqualified.

They would win the silver medal but were no match for the Ukrainian crew of skipper Yevhen Braslavets and Ihor Matviyenko, who had two firsts, two seconds, and a third in the first seven races, and did not have to start the 11th race to win the gold medal. The pair raced together in 470 at the 2000 and 2004 Olympics, finishing sixth and ninth, respectively.
In October 1997 Merricks and Walker were passengers in a minivan, which crashed when the driver lost control. Walker survived the crash but Merricks was killed. Walker continued sailing, joining with Mark Covell, and they won a silver medal in Star at the 2000 Olympics. Walker was also chosen that year to skipper Britain’s first America’s Cup challenged in 14 years, and in 2008 he was on the crew for an Italian challenger to the America’s Cup. Walker raced several times in the Volvo Ocean Races, setting the monohull record of 42 hours, 39 minutes in 2011. Like Walker, Covell lost his original partner in tragic circumstances. In December 1998, his helmsman, Glyn Charles, was swept overboard by a huge wave during a race in the Tasman Sea.

By 150 metres Gould had open water. Babashoff and Rothhammer would better the Chicago world record, but it would only be good for the silver and bronze medals, as Gould shattered the mark with 2:03.56.

Of the original six countries, only the home country remained, and the organisation had to search hastily for replacements. Of the six participating teams, only Czechoslovakia had played at the much depleted 1978 World Championships (9th), while Austria had played at two earlier World Championships. The most remarkable entry was that of Zimbabwe, which (as Rhodesia) had been banned from the Olympics in 1972 and 1976 due to the apartheid regime, which had ended in April 1980. The team had first met in May, being made up of players with an English background (such as twins Sonia Robertson and Sandy Chick). Their captain and coach was Anthea Stewart, who had played internationally for South Africa. Zimbabwe was not even officially admitted to the International Hockey Federation until after the Games. All this did not keep the Zimbabweans from a major upset. Three victories and two draws were enough to secure the young country’s first ever Olympic medal.
If the boycott had not taken place the qualifiers would most likely have been the Netherlands, West Germany, the USA, Australia and Great Britain in addition to the hosts from the Soviet Union. India had placed 13th in the 1979 tournament that acted as a qualifying event, the only team of the six eventual competing teams to be invited to be one of the eighteen who would attempt to qualify.

Weckman was not able to see the Finnish flag raised at the awards ceremony, but only a placard bearing the name “Finland”.  This was because Finland was still a province of Russia and the Russian authorities refused to allow Finland to display its flag.

Ties broken by lightest bodyweight.,na,"On the fourth day of the Olympic weightlifting competition two women’s events were held on the same day for the first time in Olympic history. The first of them was the women’s lightweight class, contested up to 59 kg, after being held up to 58 kg from 2000-16. The clear favourite was Kuo Hsing-Chun, who won a bronze medal in the 58 kg class in Rio, but since then she had been unbeaten, winning world titles in 2017 (58 kg), 2018, and 2019, as well as winning the Asian Championships in 2017 (58 kg), 2019 and 2020 (held in 2021). Furthermore, she was the world record holder in snatch (110 kg), clean & jerk (140 kg), and total (247 kg). She achieved the snatch and total record shortly before the Olympics in April 2021. The snatch world record was previously held by Choe Hyo-Sim, but she did not compete in Tokyo due to the renouncement of PRK. China’s former clean & jerk world record holder Chen Guiming, and Luo Xiaomin, second in the season ranking with 227 kg, and silver medallist at the last Asian Championships, were not present as this was one of the three weight classes China had chosen to meet the determination of only four female athletes per nation. Consequently, this was the first weightlifting event in Tokyo with no Chinese competitor. Not present in Tokyo also were Janeth Gómez, season best 220 kg, and Rosive Silgado (COL), and Taylor Wilkins (USA), both with a season best of 217 kg. This gave medal chances to Yusleidy Figueroa, season best 218 kg, Hoàng Thị Duyên, qualification best 223 kg, and Alexandra Escobar with a qualification best of 220 kg.
When Kuo started her snatch attempts all other athletes had finished and there had been some surprises. Hoàng, known as a good snatcher, lifted only 95 kg, which put her behind Polina Guryeva and Dora Tchakounté, who both cleared 96 kg, while Escobar failed to set a valid attempt when she missed 95 kg three times. A good performance was shown by Mikiko Ando clearing 94 kg, while Figueroa cleared 91 kg, but she was better at clean & jerk. Kuo finally lifted 103 kg for a comfortable lead. In the clean & jerk Guryeva lifted 119 kg in her second attempt to put her in the lead. When Hoàng missed 119 kg twice, and Tchakounté missed 120 kg, a weight that was cleared by Ando in her third attempt, the Japanese moved into second place. Only Figueroa was still fighting for a medal but she missed 125 kg. Kuo cleared 125 kg in her first attempt, which gave her the gold medal, with Guryeva taking silver and Ando bronze. Finally, Kuo tried to lift 141 kg in her last attempt. It would have been a new world record, but she failed.
The Olympic Standard for Olympic records was 102 kg for snatch, 127 kg for clean & jerk, and 229 kg for total. All three were achieved by Kou, who cleared 103 kg and 133 kg for a total of 236 kg.
The silver medal won by Guryeva was the first ever Olympic medal for Turkmenistan. The gold medal won by Kuo was the fourth Olympic gold medal for Chinese Taipei in weightlifting, their most successful sport at the Olympics, and all their gold medals had been won by women, one at each of the last four Olympics. The bronze medal for Ando was the only weightlifting medal for the host nation in Tokyo. Escobar competed in her fifth Olympics to become the third woman to do so, only three days after Hiromi Miyake and Dika Toua achieved that feat. Also competing in this event was the first ever weightlifting competitor at the Olympics for Botswana, but as Magdeline Moyengwa failed to set a valid lift in clean & jerk she was unplaced.

21150,"Cricket, Men",1900 Summer Olympics,2,Cricket,/editions/2/sports/CKT,19 – 20 August 1900,"Vélodrome Municipal de Vincennes, Paris",24 from 2 countries,Single contest between two teams.,na,"A true cricket tournament was not scheduled for the 1900 Paris Exposition. Rather the French team was to play three games against visiting teams, as follows:  4-5 August: France vs. Belgium; 11-12 August: France vs. the Netherlands; and 19-20 August: France vs. Great Britain. However, the Netherlands was unable to field a complete cricket team and Belgium did not send their team to Paris. Thus only one match took place.
By far the most complete description of the 1900 cricket match was given by the initial President of the International Society of Olympic Historians (ISOH), Ian Buchanan. Buchanan published this in Citius, Altius, Fortius, the journal of ISOH (later renamed the Journal of Olympic History). It is reproduced here with his permission.
While it is well known that the only Olympic cricket match was played in 1900 it is perhaps not so widely appreciated that cricket was also originally scheduled as an Olympic sport in 1896 and is listed in the provisional programme for the Athens Games published in Paris in January 1895. Owing to insufficient entries, what would have been the only team sport at the first Modern Olympics was not held.
There was no abundance of entries in 1900 either but in keeping with the informal nature of the Paris Games, two teams were enough to make an Olympic competition and at the Municipal Velodrome of Vincennes on Sunday, 19 August and Monday, 20 August a cricket match, which remains unique in Olympic history, took place. The game was played at the Municipal Velodrome de Vincennes, which is still in use today, and the banked cycling track formed an unusual boundary for the cricket pitch.
France, the hosts, were represented by a selection from the Union des Sociétés Français de Sports Athlétiques (USFSA) but so few of the member clubs of the Society actually played cricket that the team was drawn from just two clubs: the now defunct Union Club and the Standard Athletic Club which had been formed in 1890 by English workmen imported to construct the Eiffel Tower. These two clubs retained a strong English influence and the majority of the “French” team were, in fact, English expatriates.  Understandably, these British residents played a major role in arranging the match and three of the players were members of the nine-man Organizing Committee. Philip Tomalin, who captained the French Olympic team, also served as cricket chairman of the French Crickets Federation and it is to him that much of the credit must be given for this unique event on the Olympic calender. Also serving on Tomalin’s organizing Committee were the players T. H. Jordan and Arthur McEvoy.
The visitors were the “Devon & Somerset Wanderers Cricket Club” a well established touring side which had been formed by William Donne (who later played in the 1900 Olympic match) for a tour of the Isle of Wight in 1894.  Their visit to Paris in 1900, when they based themselves at the Hotel des Trois Princes, was the sixth tour they had undertaken and they won all three of the matches they played in the Paris area in 1900. The “Wanderers” were centered on the Castle Cary Club in Somerset and their touring teams were supplemented by players from the surrounding area who were able to leave work and home for tours of two weeks duration. There were five Castle Cary players in the 1900 Olympic team and the team also had a strong affiliation with the Devon public school, Blundell’s, who numbered four former pupils in the Olympic team.
Both teams in Paris were made up of distinctly average club cricketers, the only exception being two “Wanderers” players who had experience at the first class game. Montague Toller played six matches for Somerset in 1897 and Alfred Bowerman played once for Somerset in 1900 and made a second appearance in 1905.
The match was originally arranged with the usual eleven players in each team but, by agreement, an additional player was brought into each team at the last minute. Harry Corner joined the visiting team and J. Braid was added to the original French selection. Although the game was essentially between two club sides, posters and handbills give the occasion a fuller international flavor by announcing that it was a match between France and England. There was no mention of the Olympic Games in the pre-match publicity but the affiliation with the Paris Exhibition is quite clear.
Play began before a handful of spectators at 11:00 AM on Sunday, a one-hour break for lunch was taken at noon and, when play resumed in the afternoon, the visitors were all out for 117 runs. The host team replied with a score of 78 and play finished for the day at 5 PM. With an overnight lead of 39 the “Wanderers” gave a vastly improved batting display in the second innings and declared their innings closed at 145 runs for 5 wickets. Needing 185 runs to win, the French batting completely fell apart in the second innings. No one scored in double figures and of their six players who failed to score at all, four had also been dismissed without scoring in the first innings. After losing 10 wickets for only eleven runs the French attempted to play out time but the “Wanderers” finally won by 158 runs with five minutes to spare. Not surprisingly, the architect of the victory was the player with the most experience of the first class game, Montague Toller, who took seven wickets – all of them bowled cleanly – for nine runs.
To mark the 90th anniversary of the match the Standard Athletic Club invited the Old Blundellians Cricket Club to Paris. As has already been noted, Blundell’s School provided four players in the original team and the match, which was played on 11-12 July 1990, resulted in a draw. At the convivial post-match dinner, it was claimed that “England had retained the Olympic title!”

He broke the World Record in the single-handed clean & jerk with 92.5 kg, only to see his mark being improved by Félix Bischel shortly afterwards. His mark did open up a big lead over his main competitor, Anton Zwerina, and the three-time French champion held on for victory.

The 1920 Olympic games took place in Antwerp, Belgium, although the yachting competition was primarily held in Ostend, Belgium, during July.  In the 12-foot dinghy class, the first two races were split between two Dutch boats, the Boreas and the Beatrijs III.  It was decided to hold the deciding race in their home country, in September, at the Buiten-Y, a water near Amsterdam.
As neither of the two 1908 12 metre class entries were based in the South of England it was agreed that the owners should not be put to the trouble and expense of transporting their boats and crews from Glasgow and Liverpool to the Isle of Wight where the other Olympic races were held.  The majority of the crew of Mouchette were members of the Royal Mersey Yacht Club (Liverpool) and Hera was crewed entirely by members of the Royal Clyde Yacht Club (Glasgow).
After Hera won the first two races, it was not necessary to hold a third race, and race three, scheduled for 13 August, was cancelled.

McKeown was over two seconds faster than any swimmer in Tokyo for the event.
In the semi-finals Australia’s Emily Seebohm posted the fastest qualifier, followed by Americans Phoebe Bacon and Rhyan White, with McKeown only qualifying fifth, also trailing Canadian Kylie Masse. The final was made up of swimmers from four countries, with Australia, Canada, China, and the USA all getting both of their entrants into the top eight.

The opening pair was won by Norway’s Kai Arne Engelstad who was primarily a sprinter, but had some strength at 1,500 metres. In the second pairing, Soviet skater Sergey Khlebnikov, the 1982 World Sprints champion, finished in 1:58.83, almost two seconds better than Engelstad. The time would hold until Canada’s Gaétan Boucher started in the 10th pair. Boucher had already won the 1,000 only two days earlier, and he was almost ½-second better than Khlebnikov, finishing in 1:58.36. For Boucher it was his third medal of the Sarajevo Winter Olympics, as he had also won a bronze in the 500. Khlebnikov’s time held up for the silver, matching his silver from the 1,000. The bronze went to the Soviet Union’s Oleg Bozhyev, who was competing in his first international meet, but who would, in late March 1984, break the world record in Medeo with 1:53.26.

China had been the best women’s team in the 80s, while Cuba was dominant thru the 90s, winning three straight Olympic gold medals. But the tournament in 2004 was fairly open. The 2002 World Champions were Italy, Poland won the 2003 Europeans, and China won the 2003 World Cup. Brazil had been runner-up in the 2003 World Cup, and joined Cuba and China in the semi-finals, where they were joined by Russia, perennially on the podium at major events, including winning the 2001 Europeans.
In the first semi-final, Brazil won the first two sets over Russia, but Russia came back to win in five. In the other semi, China won the first two sets, Cuba won the third and fourth sets, but China came back to win the fifth set and end the Cuba gold medal streak. The final matched Russia and China and it again went to five sets, China winning 15-12 in the fifth. This was a great match, similar to the 1988 final. The Chinese lost the first two sets narrowly (2 points), then won the third. They were down 21-23 in the fourth (one point away from match point), but won 25-23, and then won the final set 15-12. The United States and Italy, the 2002 World Championship finalists, were both surprisingly eliminated in the quarter-finals.

Finally, the Soviets, first and third at the 1961 Europeans, sent a new competitor, Yevgeny Penyayev, to Tokyo. Thus, while there were favored nations in this event, the gold medal was anyone’s for the taking. Penyayev and Eschert won the opening rounds with room to breathe, and the final was not much different: Eschert captured gold comfortably, with Igorov nabbing silver 0.42 seconds of Penyayev, who earned bronze.

You cannot summarize it more clearly than did the 1984 Olympic edition of Swimming World, which noted, “1) He became the first man ever to score over 700, shattering the all-time best he set in the prelims of 688.05 and bettering the record prior to the Olympics of 687.90, a score he did at the 1983 FINA World Cup; 2) He won the platform by the largest margin in Olympic history, finishing 67.41 points ahead of teammate Bruce Kimball, the silver medalist. 3) He became the first male diver to sweep the Olympic diving events since Pete Desjardins of the USA in 1928 and only the third [male] ever. Louganis averaged a score of over 8.9 per dive. He never received a counting score under 8 and didn’t have a counting score under 9 on seven of his 10 dives.” His coach, Ron O’Brien, said, “It was absolutely the most dominating diving display in history. Some reporter asked me to compare it to a performance in another sport. I’d say it’s like someone going 30 feet in the long jump or running the 100 meters in 9.5.”
Bruce Kimball’s silver medal was not unexpected but was a major comeback for a man whose life was a soap opera. A platform specialist, he had been bronze medalist at the 1982 World Championships and silver medalist behind Louganis at the 1983 Pan American Games. These occurred after a car accident in 1981 when he was struck head-on by a drunk driver and suffered multiple injuries, including several facial fractures, a broken femur, torn knee ligaments, a lacerated liver, and his spleen had to be removed. He was called “The Comeback Kid” for his efforts to return to the tower.
Kimball also won a bronze medal at the 1986 World Championships. He was expected to medal again at the 1988 Olympics until 1 August 1988 when he went to a bar and had about 12 beers. By then Kimball was drinking a lot and using cocaine. After leaving the bar he got in his car and was speeding down a road in Florida, where he had been training, when he plowed the car into a group of teenagers, killing two instantly, and injuring several others quite severely. He later pleaded guilty to two counts of vehicular manslaughter and was sentenced to 17 years in prison, of which he served five, and he permanently lost his driver’s license. Kimball actually competed at the 1988 US Olympic Trials, which was quite controversial, but did not make the team.
Chinese diver Li Kongzheng won the bronze medal followed by his teammate Tong Hui. Their coach Xu Yiming was unhappy that they did not win gold or silver and said of Louganis, “[He] is an excellent diver but has his shortcomings and new divers will solve those and pass him.” Nobody was quite sure what those shortcomings were.

Drysdale’s 2010 World Championship loss came at the hands of the Czech Republic’s Ondřej Synek, the silver medalist from Beijing and the most recent World Championship and a strong contender for the 2012 Olympic title. The defending Olympic champion, Norway’s Olaf Tufte, had a chance to reach the podium once more, although his form had slipped somewhat from his peak in Beijing. The hometown favorite for Britain was Alan Campbell, whose first Olympic appearance came in 2004 and who had placed second (2009) and third (2010 and 2011) in recent World Championships.
All four favorites passed through the heats but Tufte failed to advance out of the semi-finals after coming last in a heat won by Drysdale. This left Drysdale, Synek, and Campbell as the most likely finishers on the podium, although Sweden’s Lassi Karonen, who had placed sixth in 2008, challenged the trio for the first quarter of the race. At the halfway mark, Drysdale and Synek began distancing themselves beyond the reach of the rest of the pack but, by 1500m, Drysdale had clearly established himself as the front runner and easily nabbed the gold, leaving Synek with his second Olympic silver medal. Campbell and Karonen battled for the bronze right to the line but Campbell, certainly invigorated by the cheers of the home crowd, pulled ahead in the final 150m and took the final spot on the podium.

The race was run as a final only, with no heats, as has become standard for the 10K. The early lead was taken by Kenyan Paul Tanui. At 4,000 metres Farah was running alongside American training partner Galen Rupp when Rupp clipped Farah’s foot and the Brit fell to the track. Farah was up quickly and Rupp slowed to pace him back to the lead pack, reminiscent of a cycling peleton move, and the 1972 Olympic final, when Lasse Virén had fallen mid-race on his way to the gold medal, and a world record.
With one kilometer left, there was a lead pack of six runners, including Farah, Tanui, and Rupp, when Farah went to the front and ran a 62.4 lap, stringing out the field, and dropping his training partner. Tanui took the lead at the bell, and led by two full metres at 200, but Farah had the speed to chase him down, running his final 100 in 13.4, and his last 800 in 1:56.6.

The 1959 Pan-American Games champion had retired to raise a family but, buoyed by the prospect of an Olympic Games on home soil, returned to edge out the 1964 champion Ildikó Rejtő-Ujlaky to win the silver medal. This was Mexico’s first ever medal in the sport.

This event had been held in France since 1894 and was a paced race, and had been won in 1894-95 and 1898 by Constant Huret, who was present in 1900 and likely favored, although Britain’s Albert Walters had won the event in 1899, and was also present at the 1900 Paris Exposition. Twelve riders started the race, which began at night, with distances recorded for the top eight. Huret, who had won the long-distance Bordeaux-Paris race in 1899, did not finish but Walters was a major factor throughout. He led for 19 hours, and set 16 world records en route, but had to withdraw from exhaustion in the 20th hour. Dutch rider Matthieu Cordang eventually won easily, by 62 km over German Thaddäus Robl. The total purse was 25,000 francs, with Cordang receiving over 7,000 francs, which consisted of a purse for winning and for various primes.
The leaders after each hour, with distances covered, were as follows:
1	Walters	55.525 km
2	Walters	106.150 km
3	Walters	151.560 km	WR

23	Cordang	921.400 km
24	Cordang	956.775 km
Cordang’s mark of 956.775 km was well short of the record set by Walters, who recorded 1,020.977 km in 1899, but Walters’ mark was motor-paced (or electric tandem-paced). In 1900, the pacers were triplet bikes, as was true in 1898. The race had been tandem paced in 1894-97. The previous races had been held at other velodromes, not at Vincennes.
The Bol d’Or would not be held in 1901 but was held from 1902-13 continually, and then intermittently after the war. It was held in 1928 and then one more time in 1950. Huret returned to win again in 1902, but the greatest rider in the Bol d’Or would be Frenchman Léon Georget who won the event nine times, in 1903, consecutively from 1907-13, and after the war in 1919.

But early in 1992 she and some of her teammates went to train in South Africa. There were accusations that this was done to avoid drug testing and the Germans responded by sending a testing team down there. All of the women tested negative but then it was revealed that all of the urine samples had come from the same person. They were all suspended for four years by the German Track Federation, but after appeals to the IAAF this was revoked. However, in June Krabbe withdrew from the Olympics, because of the stress she had been through in the past few months. In July she did test positive, this time for clenbuterol, and she never competed again.

In the sprint for the gold Bjørgen took advantage of a small gap that opened up, winning with Kalla 1.8 seconds behind. Weng was successful in the contest for the bronze medal, beating Johaug and Saarinen in a close finish.
In winning the opening event at Sochi Marit Bjørgen, on that day 33 years, 324 days old, and already a triple gold medalist at Vancouver in 2010, bettered the mark set by the Italian Stefania Belmondo as the oldest female Winter Olympics gold medalist

Ties broken by lightest bodyweight.,na,"After two days of women-only weightlifting events, the middleweight class was contested as the third men’s event in Tokyo. After the reorganization of the weight classes back in 2018, this class was now held for a body weight up to 73 kg. After China had already won the first two men’s events, this class also saw China’s Shi Zhiyong start as clear favourite. Shi, who won gold in Rio in the 63 kg class, was unbeaten in the 73 kg class, winning world titles in 2018 and 2019, and the Asian Championships in 2019 and 2020 (held in 2021). Before this Games he also set five snatch, three clean & jerk, and four total world records in this weight class, holding the current records in snatch with 169 kg, clean & jerk with 198 kg, and in total with 363 kg. The only other athlete to set a world record in this weight class was Won Jeong-Sik, who set a clean & jerk record back in 2018. He qualified for Tokyo, but had to withdraw shortly before the Games due to a shoulder injury. Also not present in Tokyo was Rizki Juniansyah (INA), who turned 18 shortly before the Games. He took all three junior world records in May 2021 for a season best of 349 kg, but the qualification system prevented him qualifying. Rahmat Abdullah qualified for Indonesia through the continental ranking of Asia. Also taking part was the former world junior record holder and four-time world junior champion (2016-2019) CJ Cummings, qualification best 347 kg, Julio Mayora, qualification best 349 kg, and Marin Robu, season best 339 kg, who qualified only after the retirement of Won.
The competition started early afternoon with group B with Abdullah, who only entered with 320 kg, lifting a total of 342 kg, which was the third best mark of the season and only four lifters achieved a better mark during the qualification for Tokyo. In group A, five lifters scored better than Abdullah in snatch, but three of them were not able to beat his total mark as his 190 kg in clean & jerk remained the second-best lift. Only Mayora and Briken Calja also lifted 190 kg, which gave Mayora silver, but Calja could only finish in fourth place. Nevertheless, it was still the best ever Olympic weightlifting result for Albania. Untouchable was Shi, who had already a clear margin of 10 kg after the snatch and also produced the best performance with 198 kg in clean & jerk to set the first new world record at this Games with 364 kg in total.
The Olympic Standard for Olympic records was 158 kg for snatch, 190 kg for clean & jerk, and 345 kg for total. Only Shi was able to better any of these marks, twice in snatch to finally 166 kg, twice in clean & jerk to finally 198 kg, and three times in total to finally 364 kg, which also marked a new world record.

After the first round Germany and Japan were separated by less than a point but Jinya Nishikata and Takanobu Okabe performed well in the second round and with one man left for each nation Japan held the advantage. By the time Masahiko Harada stood at the top of the jump he knew what he had to do to ensure a Japanese victory. A jump of around 105 m would be enough and since he had made a leap of 122 m in the first round this appeared to be a relative formality. Instead the jump turned into a disaster as he mistimed his leap and landed at just 97.5 m. One of the defining images of the 1994 Games is of Harada kneeling in the snow with head in his hands as his team-mates stood in disbelief. Prior to 1994 only the best three jumps of each team counted per round but the rules were changed before Lillehammer and all jumps were now added to the team’s score. If the old rules had still been in place Japan would have recorded a clear victory.

As always, the endurance phase is critical in the three-day event, and Australia won this phase by a large margin to take an almost insurmountable lead into jumping, but Australia’s Brian Crago did not finish the endurance phase, which meant that all three Australian riders had to take part and finish the jumping for them to win. This meant that Bill Roycroft would have to start, but Roycroft sustained a concussion and a broken collarbone in the endurance competition, and was hospitalized. He insisted on leaving the hospital and riding the next day in the jumping and helped Australia win the gold medal.

The class was designed in 1963 by Frenchman André Cornu.
This event came down to the final race, which was won by the West German crew of Frank Hübner and Harro Bode, enabling them to move ahead of the Spanish crew of Antonio Gorostegui and Pedro Millet and win the gold medal. Of the medalists, only Gorostegui would ever compete at the Olympics again and this was his only medal.

It was therefore natural that the two Italian bobs would assume the mantle of favourites at the 1964 Games. Italy I was driven by reigning world champion Sergio Zardini  whilst Eugenio Monti in Italy II had added the 1960 and 1961 world titles to his numerous successes in the two man championships. Other contenders for the gold included Austria I, who had placed third in the 1963 World Championships, 1962 champions West Germany and the Great Britain bob piloted by two man champion Tony Nash.  The wild cards of the event were Canada I who had not challenged for a medal when the World Championships visited Igls twelve months earlier but had shown a steady improvement over the previous few seasons.
That Canada led after the first run was a surprise but the fact that they shattered the track record and finished nearly half a second clear of the field was a sensation. Expectations were still that the Italians would take over at the top of the leader board but they continued to falter and Canada increased their lead on the succeeding three runs. Austria I overtook Italy II for silver after the third run and held on narrowly to the medal at the conclusion of the event with a margin of just 0.12 seconds. The Canadian victory may not have been possible without the generosity of Eugenio Monti as the Italian had provided the use of his own mechanics to repair a rear axle on the Canadian bob during the competition.
Vic Emery, the pilot of the victorious Canadian bob, was travelling through Europe in the winter of 1956 when he hitched a lift with a truck carrying equipment for the British bobsleigh team en route to the Winter Olympics. Captivated by the events in Cortina he returned to Montreal and became a pioneer of the sport in Canada. His Olympic victory came just five years after he had driven his nation’s first ever entry at world championship level and was achieved despite a perceived lack of enthusiasm from the Canadian sporting authorities and the lack of a bob run in his home country. Emery and the Canadians proved their success was no fluke by adding the 1965 world title to their Olympic victory before retiring at the end of the season.

The story of the early rounds was the showing of Aleksey Kiselyov of the Soviet Union. Kiselyov had moved up in weight from the middleweight division but had adapted well and was noted as a strong and aggressive fighter. The stocky Soviet accounted for Pietrzykowski in the semi-finals and was fully expected to use his strength to batter Pinto in the final. What happened next didn’t conform to expectations and instead the fight developed into a fairly negative affair. Two judges awarded the contest to the Italian by a single point whilst the other three had the two men level at 59 points apiece. Two of the tied judges awarded their preference to the Kiselyov but crucially the German judge opted for Pinto and the man from Novara was crowned Olympic champion. Pinto fought on as an amateur and retired in 1968 still only 25 years of age.

With Wang Xin and Li Xuerui ranked second and third respectively, China was the dominant force going into the Olympics and a favorite to capture all three podium spots.
The Chinese competitors did not disappoint, winning every match they played in the group stage in two rounds. They were only slightly less dominant in the round of 16 and the quarterfinals – it took three rounds for Wang Yihan to defeat Bae Yeon-Ju of Korea in the round of 16, while Inthanon Ratchanok of Thailand was toppled by Wang Xin in three during the quarterfinals – but they remained favorites for all three medals going into the semi-finals, with India’s Saina Nehwal rounding out the four. Wang Yihan easily defeated Nehwal 21-13, 21-13 to earn her spot in the final, while a much more-hotly contested match between Li and Wang Xin ended in a 21-20, 21-18 victory for Li. The final was somewhat surprising, with Li defeating the number one-ranked Wang Yihan 21-15, 21-23, 21-17, but most attention centered around the bronze medal-match, where Nehwal became the first competitor from India to win an Olympic badminton medal amid somewhat controversial circumstances. Wang Xin had won the first round of the match 21-18 and had already scored her first point in the second when a knee injury forced her to retire and cede victory to Nehwal. While Wang Xin’s teammates, and many observers, felt that she would have won the match had it continued to its natural end, Nehwal was confident that she had been wearing down her opponent and that she would have captured bronze regardless.

Teddy Riner, the country’s flagbearer during the Opening Ceremony and one of the heavy favorites, successfully defended his gold medal from London. The 2.04 m tall, almost 140 kg giant, continued his winning streak at European and World Championships, as well as Olympic Games, because his last major defeat was in the final of the 2010 World Championships. In the quarter-final in Rio, Riner opposed the home favorite Rafael da Silva. Although Silva received three penalties, he survived the regular period of five minutes but was eventually defeated by a Waza-ari (half point) by Riner. In the semi-final, Riner had to once more go the full distance against Israel’s Or Sasson, again winning by a Waza-ari with Sumi-gaeshi (corner throw) in the last second.
The other half of the draw was dominated by Japan’s Hisayoshi Harasawa. After a difficult start in his first bout, he dominated his remaining opponents , winning the next three fights by Ippon (full point). The final was between the two dominant judokas in this division, Riner and Harasawa, but the gold medal was finally decided based on Shidos (penalties), with two given to Harasawa early in the bout and one to Riner half a minute from the final bell. This was enough for Riner to clinch the gold, leaving silver for Harasawa. The bronze medals went to two of Riner’s victims, Rafael Silva and Or Sasson.
In his first contest of the day, Sasson met Egypt’s Islam El-Shehaby, a fixture overshadowed by political issues. When the Israeli won by Ippon, El-Shehaby refused to shake hands or bow, the normal gesture of appreciation after any encounter in judo. Consequently, the Egyptian was booed by the crowd. Allegedly, he had been under pressure by nationalists and Islamists not to compete at all.

She lowered it a few times more to 37.55 in December 1997. Weeks before the Olympics, Le May Doan won the distance twice at the World Sprint Championships, also grabbing the overall title. She had also won five of the six World Cup races that season, the only other victory being claimed by fellow Canadian Susan Auch. Some of the top racers from the previous season had trouble adapting to the new clap skate, such as 1997 World Champion Xue Ruihong, who would fare no better than 14th at the Olympics.

At the European Championships in Berlin, three weeks before the Olympics, Cecilia Colledge, now 15, impressed the audience by being the first female figure skater to perform a double jump in competition, when she successfully landed a double Salchow. Colledge was a creative figure skater, introducing two new elements in her program, the camel and layback spins, but still she had to be satisfied with the silver medal in Berlin behind Henie. Bronze medalist Megan Taylor was not selected for the British Olympic team. An accident in the summer of 1935 prevented her from competing in the Olympic trials.
At the Olympics, Henie had a narrow lead over Colledge after the compulsory figures, though she was displeased by the judging. In the free skating, Colledge’s performance was delayed due to music trouble, and she almost fell during the first part of her performance. But she recovered and finished her program with an average score of 5.7. Henie, starting last of the 26 competitors, made an excellent free program and won her third Olympic gold with an average score of 5.8. A week later she ended her amateur career in Vienna, winning her tenth World Championship title in a row. Only the Swede Ulrich Salchow, winning 11 consecutive world titles from 1901 to 1911, has a better World Figure Skating Championships record. Her later career in USA as movie star and ice show performer made her one of the wealthiest and most famous Olympians ever.
With her teammate Megan Taylor, Colledge dominated international figure skating after Henie’s retirement together. She won three European Championships in a row 1937-1939 with Taylor placing second, and the 1937 World Championships also ended with the same result. In 1938 at Stockholm she was beaten by Taylor, who defended her championship in 1939 with Colledge not present. The British dominance in female figure skating was, however, interrupted by the outbreak of the Second World War.
Vivi-Anne Hultén of Sweden won a close contest for the third place in Garmisch-Partenkirchen, and could add to her collection of four World and two European Championships medals, however no gold, with an Olympic bronze. The fourth place finisher, Liselotte Landbeck representing Belgium, was born in Vienna.

While the winner of the CompOsitions for Orchestra, Werner Egk was favored by the Nazi government, the Solo/Chorus victor was Paul Höffer, who had been derisively described as a “Cultural Bolshevist”. However, his choral work, Olympischer Schwur (Olympic Oath), might have had an edge with the jury, as the lyrics had been provided by Pierre, Baron de Coubertin, president of the IOC (and himself winner of an Olympic art medal in 1912). It is unknown whether this information was known to the jury at the time.
A novelty in Olympic music contests was that the winning works were performed live during the Olympics. During a concert on 15 August at the Dietrich-Eckart-Bühne (part of the Olympic complex), both Höffer’s winning entry and Kurt Thomas’ Kantate zur Olympiade 1936 were played by the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra.

With star players like Ronaldo and Bebeto in attendance, the South Americans suffered a shock defeat at the hands of Japan in their first match, but the team recovered to reach the semi-finals. There, they met Nigeria, which had already lost to Brazil in the group stage. The Africans had a team composed of star players from several European leagues, and five had competed in the 1994 World Cup. But the “Super Eagles” trailed 3-1 at the interval.
Following an Ikpeba goal, a late shot by Nwankwo Kanu forced the match into overtime. For the first time the, golden goal rule was in force, meaning the first team to score in extra time would win the match. Kanu secured his role as man of the match by scoring just minutes into extra time. Nigeria encountered a second South American opponent in the final, Argentina. The match was somewhat overshadowed by blunders from the referee and his linesman. Argentina pulled ahead 2-1 from a rather undeserved spot kick, and the match decider two minutes before the final whistle was scored with three Nigerians in offside position. But this did not matter to the Nigerians, who celebrated Africa’s first Olympic gold medal in football.
In the years since the Atlanta Olympics many questions have been asked about the true ages of certain members of the Nigerian squad. Allegations that as many as half the team were overage, some by as many as ten years, have been made but none has been proved beyond doubt to be true.

Brian Shimer and USA II had moved steadily up the leader board into fourth position and, with track conditions deteriorating on the final run, he set the early benchmark time. USA I could not match their team-mates time but had just enough time in hand to hold on to their positions. The same was not true of the Swiss and Martin Annen’s sled dropped from second to fourth which confirmed a shock medal for the second USA sled and the fact that two American crews would reach the podium for the first time since 1932.

In 1990 he was chased by Britain’s Linford Christie, who won both the Commonwealth Games and the European Championships. Lewis, hampered by a viral infection at the Trials, only made the US team in the long jump. Burrell and Dennis Mitchell both qualified for the 100. Burrell and Christie looked on top form in the prelims, with Burrell defeating Christie 9.97 to 10.00 in the semis into a headwind. But in the final, after two false starts, Burrell started very slowly and was never in the race. Christie won fairly comfortably with a charge in the last 50 metres. Namibia’s Frank Fredericks was second, and Mitchell won the bronze medal.

The heavy favorite was Ethiopia’s Tirunesh Dibaba, who had never lost a 10K race, and had won the World Championships in 2005 and 2007. The race was a final only and was held in high heat and humidity, especially considering the start time. The early lead was taken by Lornah Kiplagat, a Kenyan-born Dutchwoman. She powered thru 5K in 15:09.98, shredding the field as only 10 remained in the lead pack at that point. Kiplagat led thru almost 7K, when she fell back, the lead taken by Turkey’s Elvan Abeylegesse, with Dibaba moving into second. With a kilometer remaining, they had 10 seconds on the chasers. Abeylegesse led to the bell, when Dibaba surged ahead and had five metres on the Turk by the final curve, when she opened up even more, winning by 15 metres. Her time of 29:54.66 made her only the second woman to run under 30 minutes, and she also pulled Abeylegesse under the barrier as well (29:56.34). American Shalane Flanagan moved into third place with 600 metres remaining. But because the field was so strung out, she was not certain of her place. She won the bronze medal but did not realize that until being told after the race. Dibaba returned a week later to win the 5K, becoming the first woman to win the distance double at the Olympics.
That was how the event and the results seemed to have ended. In 2015, however, the IOC began re-testing samples from the 2008 Beijing and 2012 London Olympics, using newer, more advanced testing techniques, in an effort to find those who had used performance enhancing drugs (PEDs), but in whom it could not be detected at the time of those Olympics. This was one of the many events affected.
In March 2017 Elvan Abeylegesse of Turkey was revealed to have a positive re-test from the 2007 World Championships for stanozolol, and was disqualified, losing her silver medal. She was given a two-year ban from the time of the 2007 Worlds, which negated her 2008 Olympic results. American Shalane Flanagan was moved up to the silver medal, while Kenyan Linet Masai received the bronze medal. Abeylegesse was also disqualified from the 5,000 metres, in which she also initially received a silver medal.

Cuban Juan Miguel Echevarria, the champion at Rio in 2016, was still considered a gold medal contender and led the qualifying with 8.50.
In the final, Gayle was obviously not at his best and would finish only 11th. Cuba’s Maykel Massó led after round one with 8.21 but Echevarria took over the lead in round three with 8.41. In round four American JuVaughn Harrison moved into third place with a mark of 8.15. Harrison had competed in the high jump final the night before the long jump final.
In the final round Spain’s Eusebio Cáceres moved out to 8.18 to settle in the bronze medal position. Greece’s Miltiádis Tentóglou then leapt 8.41, equalling Echevarria’s leader, but Tentóglou had a better second mark and took the lead. Echevarria needed only 26-9¼ (8.16) to defend his gold medal, a mark that seemed easy for him. But as he approached the board, something gave in his leg, and he fell to the ground in obvious discomfort, sobbing as he realized he had lost the gold medal to Tentóglou.
Massó won the bronze medal while Cáceres was fourth, and Harrison fifth. For Tentóglou this was the first medal ever in the long jump by a Greek athlete, although in 1912 Kostas Tsiklitiras had won gold in the standing long jump.

He also won six of them, including the Grand Prix de l’Aeronautique, which was the all-around ballooning title, based on results in the other events. For winning this event he received a silver plaque valued at 200 francs.
Count de la Vaulx was considered the pioneer of aeronautics in France and was a co-founder of the Aero Club de France in 1898. Later in October 1900 he set a distance record for most distance travelled by balloon, covering just over 1,900 km (1,200 miles) from Vincennes to Korostychev, near Kyiv, Ukraine in 35¾ hours. He was given the Grand Medal of the Aero Club de France for his contributions to aviation and in 1905 Count de la Vaulx co-founded and became a director of the Fédération Aéronautique Internationale (FAI).

In 2000 she won two golds, one on springboard and one in the synchronized springboard, ending her Olympic career with four gold medals and one silver. The bronze went to American Mary Ellen Clark, who had fought vertigo for the past few years, a devastating problem for divers.

The Slalom World Cup standings after seven of eight races saw Riesch (winner of the 2008-09 Slalom World Cup) in the lead followed by Zettel, Aubert, and Schild (winner of the Slalom World Cup in 2006-07 and 2007-08). Schild had recovered right before this season after missing the 2008-09 season due to a complex fracture of her left lower leg after a fall in a training run on 9 October 2008. Riesch was also the reigning 2009 world champion as she won gold at Val d’Isère, while Záhrobská took silver and Tanja Poutiainen finished third. At the 2007 World Championship in Åre Záhrobská won gold in front of Schild (silver) and Anja Pärson (bronze).

As with a number of the other alpine skiing events, this too was held in poor weather conditions, fog being the main culprit. However the race went ahead on schedule and, after the first run, super combined gold medalist Riesch had the fastest time of 50.75 seconds, followed by slalom specialists Záhrobská, 0.40 seconds behind, and Schild another 0.25 seconds back. Elisabeth Görgl, with the 22nd fastest time of the first run, took the early lead in the second run with a combined time of 1:44.97, which would eventually be good enough for 7th place, and her time was not bettered until Aubert, 7th fastest in the first run. The medals would eventually be decided among the three leaders after the first run. Schild, first off of the three leaders, set the combined target time of 1:43.32. Záhrobská, skiing with a degree of caution, let slip her first run advantage to finish in 1:43.90, behind Schild. With the pressure on, and having seen her sister Susanne straddle a gate when threatening to set a fast time, Maria Riesch skied a controlled second run to finish in a combined time of 1:42.89 and win her second gold medal of the Games. This made Riesch the most successful Alpine skier at Vancouver, making her the only participant to win two gold medals. She used Head skis to win the race as did Záhrobská to win bronze. Schild used Atomic for her silver medal, while Maria Pietilä-Holmner trusted Rossignol to place fourth.

The United States was expected to be their biggest challenge, led by Justin Gatlin, Tyson Gay, and Trayvon Bromell. However, the US was renowned for botching baton exchanges, having done so at the last 143 major internationals, or so it seemed.
Both teams made it to the final, and the Jamaicans won the expected gold medal, with the United States finishing third, trailing the surprise Japanese team, who won the silver medal. Moments after the finish, the requisite disqualification of the US team occurred, as video showed the first exchange had been made out of the zone, and the US continued its streak of being DQed in this event, as Canada moved up to bronze. The Japanese team’s individual 100 metre PRs were not even close to the marks of the other teams, but their baton exchanges were impeccable, which led to their silver medal.
Bolt’s gold medal in this event was his 9th overall, equaling the mark for track & field athletics held by Paavo Nurmi and Carl Lewis, although still trailing the 10 won by Ray Ewry, if one includes the 1906 Intercalated Olympics. However, shortly after the Olympics, in re-testing of samples from the Beijing Olympics, one of his teammates on the 2008 relay, Nesta Carter, had a positive test for methylhexanamine. He was initially disqualified but appealed the ruling to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS). However, the appeal was not successful, meaning Carter remained disqualified and Bolt lost his 2008 relay gold medal, affecting his medal standings as noted above.

Russia’s Stanislava Komarova was generally accepted to be the most talented in the race for gold but could be frustratingly inconsistent at the highest level. The 2003 World Champion and world leader for 2004 was Katy Sexton but the British team of which she was a part had endured a poor time at the Games.
Few would have considered Zimbabwe’s Kirsty Coventry a medal favourite before the Games began but the American-based swimmer had already won a silver and a bronze and this event was potentially a stronger one for her. Coventry took the lead from the first few strokes and left Komarova trailing in her wake to claim Zimbabwe’s first individual Olympic gold and the first by any African swimmer from outside South Africa. Komarova held on for silver with Reiko Nakamura of Japan and Germany’s Antje Buschschulte finishing in a dead heat for third.
Coventry’s win came at the time when racial tensions in Zimbabwe were at a peak and, for a short time at least, brought the troubled country some measure of joy.

Sweden’s Svante Rasmuson took the lead after the fencing, followed by Masala. They maintained that position after the 300 freestyle swim, a specialty for Ramuson, who had competed as a swimmer (100 freestyle) at the 1976 Olympics. On the morning of the final day, Masala moved ahead of Ramuson after the shooting, taking a 26-point lead into the run. But Rasmuson was a better runner and with the new format, featuring a staggered start, it was thought Rasmuson might be able to catch the Italian. He did that, but only about 100 metres from the finish. However, the effort had exhausted him and he staggered on some soft dirt on the final straight and Masala was able to pass him to regain the lead and win the gold medal.

The omnium was much awaited as it contained some of the best endurance riders in the world including the 2019 and 2020 world omnium champions Campbell Stewart of New Zealand and France’s Benjamin Thomas. British bronze medallist from the last two World Championships, Ethan Hayter and Matthew Walls, were also in the field as was the 2012 Olympic champion, and Rio bronze medallist, Lasse Norman Hansen, fresh from his team pursuit silver in Tokyo. The defending Olympic champion Elia Viviani of Italy, and Netherlands’ Jan-Willem van Schip made up an already strong start list.

Before the men’s 10,000 m, this was said of Sven Kramer. And during the race, Kramer did defeat himself.
Sven Kramer had been absolutely dominant in men’s speed skating since the 2006 Olympics. He had won nine distance world titles (winning the 5,000, 10,000 and team pursuit three times each), three World Allround titles, three European Allround titles and two long distance World Cups. Since 10 March 2007, the 10,000 m world record was in his hands, as well as five more of the 10 fastest times ever in the event. Dutch speed skating fans, always present in big numbers at major events, had already pre-filled Kramer’s name as the gold medalist.
When Kramer went to the start in the final pair, the fastest time had been set by Lee Seung-Hun. The Korean, who had already surprised with a silver in the 5,000 m, had finished in 12:58.55, slightly faster than the Olympic Record from 2002. This performance was quite remarkable, considering the fact that Lee had only twice before skated a 10,000 m, and he had beaten his personal best by some 25 seconds. Behind Lee, Ivan Skobrev of Russia and defending champion Bob de Jong held the other medal positions.
As expected, Kramer skated well under Lee’s pace, and seemed headed for his second gold medal. But after 6,600 m, Kramer’s coach Gerard Kemkers feared Kramer would be entering the wrong lane after the cross-over (skater have to change lanes each lap), and shouted for him to switch lanes. Kramer only just managed to do this, but Kemkers had been wrong, and he had directed his pupil into the wrong lane. While already fearing disqualification, Kramer still finished the race, in 12:54.50. But he was of course disqualified, and Kramer’s “certain gold” went to Lee.
Kramer was initially very angry with his coach’s mistake, and speculation arose that the two - working together since the start of Kramer’s senior career - might separate, but the two quickly discussed matters and looked forward to the team pursuit. Back home in the Netherlands, the disqualification became the tragi-comic highlight of the Winter Olympics, receiving more attention than the gold medals won by Dutch athletes in Vancouver.

Four years later in Rio, the same two teams were at the top of the table after the preliminaries. But Mills and Clark had already secured the women’s 470 gold with a 19-point lead and had only to complete the medal race. Their 2012 opponents from New Zealand had already lost the chances to repeat their triumph when they were disqualified in two of the preliminary races, only one of which could be discarded from the total points. Nevertheless they were one of the five teams that still had a chance to win silver or bronze. The men’s and women’s 470 finals had to be postponed by one day due to extremely low wind. A third place in the medal race, ahead of their closest rivals USA (10th) and France (6th), secured the silver for New Zealand. Annie Haeger and Briana Provancha interfered with the Japanese boat and dropped to last place. France’s Camille Lecointre and Hélène Defrance ousted the US team from the bronze medal place. Lecointre with her previous team-mate Mathilde Géron had just missed the podium in 2012, finishing fourth.

By 1973, the West Germans had established the first all-female marathons, and the pioneer administrator who supported women in the marathon was the German Dr. Ernst van Aaken. In 1983 a women’s marathon was included at the first Athletics World Championships in Helsinki, won by Grete Waitz of Norway. Waitz, a former track runner, was the first great female marathoner, winning the New York Marathon from 1979-83, and she would eventually win New York nine times. She was the early favorite for Los Angeles.  Also to be watched were Portugal’s Rosa Mota, who had won the 1982 European Championship, and America’s Joan Benoit, who won the 1979 and 1983 Boston Marathon. Her 1983 Boston win was in a world marathon best time of 2-22:43. But Benoit was not fully healthy, having required arthroscopic surgery on her knee only a few weeks before the US Olympic Trial, and she was considered fortunate to make the team.
The women’s marathon was the first track & field event of the 1984 Olympics, starting at 8 AM. It started at the Santa Monica City College track and ran along LA freeways to the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. Benoit moved into the lead at 7 km., and Waitz let her get away, saying later that she thought the move was made too early. But Benoit never came back. She stayed in the lead throughout, running by herself for most of the race, winning by almost 1½ minutes, with Waitz winning the silver medal and Mota the bronze.
Finishing in 37th place was Swiss runner Gaby Andersen-Schiess, but that simple statement belies the drama of her finish. Andersen-Schiess was not a medal favorite but was still considered a top runner. However, the heat affected her and when she entered the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum at the finish of the race, she essentially wobbled onto the track, her form redolent of Dorando Pietri in 1908 or Jim Peters at the finish of the 1954 British Empire Games marathon. Andersen-Schiess’s course was all over the track on her final lap of the stadium, as she could not maintain a straight line, and she appeared near collapse throughout. There were calls to remove her from the race and stop her, for fears of her health, but no one intervened and she finished the race. Though exhausted, she was well within a few hours and suffered no ill effects from her effort.

All the German sliders had won their individual or doubles events earlier in the Beijing Games, making them clear favourites in the mixed relay.
Germany swept the luge gold medals in Beijing, something that has been achieved four times before, and all were by German teams. The German Democratic Republic did so in 1976 and 1988, and Germany in 1998 and 2014. Only the 2014 Germany sweep was over four events as opposed to three in the other years, as the mixed team relay was added to that year’s Olympic programme.
The German team was very experienced as all four sliders grew up training together. Geisenberger, Arlt, and Wendl were 34-years-old, while Ludwig was almost 36. Ludwig became the oldest gold medallist in this event at 35 years, 361 days. He was the second oldest gold medallist in any luge event, after Sylke Otto in 2006 women’s singles, who was 36 years, 221 days
Geisenberger and Wendl/Arlt won their third gold medals in the event, while Ludwig won his second, as the German team was the same foursome that won gold in 2018. Arlt, Wendl and Geisenberger all won their sixth luge gold medals, the best ever for Olympic luge sliders. This also puts all three in a tie for fifth place for most gold medals at the Olympic Winter Games. Geisenberger then became Germany’s most successful winter Olympian with six gold and one bronze in total.
The German victory was much closer than expected, as their margin over the second-placed Austrian team was only 0.08 seconds, and Germany trailed for much of the relay, with only Arlt and Wendl pulling ahead on their run. The Austrian team consisted of Madeleine Egle, Wolfgang Kindl, and the doubles pair of Thomas Steu and Lorenz Koller.
Latvia took the bronze medal, almost a full second behind Germany. Their team roster was Elīza Tīruma-Cauce, Kristers Aparjods, and the doubles pair of Mārtiņš Bots and Roberts Plūme. Austria and Latvia had both medalled in this event previously, Austria winning bronze in 2018 and Latvia taking bronze in 2014.
