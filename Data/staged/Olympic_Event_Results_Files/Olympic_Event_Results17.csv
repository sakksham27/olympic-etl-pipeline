Braun had been the silver medallist behind her compatriot Willy den Turk at the previous year’s European Championships but had been steadily improving since then. Den Turk fell ill in the run-up to the Olympics and was advised to miss the Games for medical reasons. If Dutch hopes were dampened by the sight of the Scottish swimmer, Ellen King, breaking the world record in the first heat, these worries soon passed when Braun replied by swimming four tenths of a second inside this new time. The final saw Braun, roared on by the home crowd, survive a poor finish to hold off the challenge of King and her fellow Briton, Joyce Cooper, to become the first Dutchwoman to win an individual Olympic event. Braun, whose mother was the coach to the Dutch team, attempted to defend her Olympic title four years later in Los Angeles but an apparent insect bite developed into a serious case of blood poisoning that kept her out of the final. After spending weeks in a Los Angeles hospital, Braun returned home to Rotterdam and gave a press conference where she alleged her illness was not caused by an insect but was the result of a deliberate attempt to injure her. Speculation involved a possible link to illegal betting. Another finalist in 1928 was the fourteen year old Eleanor Holm who began an international career that would veer between brilliance and controversy over the next decade.

Finland’s Viljo Heino was to make his marathon début at London, and as the world-record holder at 10,000 metres and in the one-hour run, he was considered someone to watch. The London organizers chose to not to run over the point-to-point course used for the 1908 Olympics, which had established the standard marathon distance of 42.195 km. (26 miles, 385 yards). Instead, the race started and finished at Wembley Stadium, looping thru the London suburbs.
Raceday was cloudy and humid, with some wind, with the event starting at 3 PM. The immediate lead was taken by the Belgian Étienne Gailly in his marathon début. He held the lead almost the entire race, but was passed briefly at about 35 km. by the Korean, Choi Yoon-Chil. However, Gailly regained the lead quickly and held it as he entered Wembley Stadium. Unfortunately, he had given all he had to that point. He was wobbling and stumbling along the track, evoking memories of Dorando Pietri in 1908. On the track he was passed first by Argentina’s Delfo Cabrera, who had run a steady pace moving up throughout, and then by Britain’s Tom Richards. Cabrera won the gold medal, with Richards second. Gailly was able to finish the race, and held on for a bronze medal. He had never gone beyond 18 miles in training but before the race said “If I am still standing at the finish I will have won a medal”. Gailly did both but only barely.
The following morning at 7.30 am Richards was back at his work as a psychiatric nurse at a hospital around 15 miles from the stadium.

Another favorite was Greg Louganis – OK, you get the point.
In their absence, the gold medal went to Soviet diver Aleksandr Portnov, who was felt to benefit from some hometown officiating. On an early final dive, he flopped badly on a back 2½, but protested that he had been distracted by the cheering crowd, which was watching the 100 butterfly final. Portnov was awarded another dive, and performed it well this time. This did not sit well with Mexican Carlos Girón, eventual silver medalist, nor Italy’s Franco Cagnotto, the bronze medalist, and fourth-placed Falk Hoffmann of East Germany, who had been runner-up to Boggs at the 1978 Worlds. They protested that they had had to dive through similar distractions and Portnov should not have been awarded another dive. For two days the officials met before holding a medal ceremony. But this was Moscow and Portnov was a Soviet, so again, you get the point.
Portnov won a bronze in this event at the 1982 Worlds. Greg Louganis won.

After winning gold medals in 1956, 1964, and 1972, Luciano Giovannetti continued the Italian tradition of winning the trap gold medal at every other Olympic Games. His 198 gave him a two-point margin over three shooters – Rustam Yambulatov (URS), Jörg Damme (GDR), and Josef Hojny of Czechoslovakia. Hojny went out in the first shoot-off and did not medal, while Yambulatov won silver with a 25 possible in the second shoot-off. Giovannetti would return in 1984 to defend his gold medal.

In London the nation was represented by Peter Kirkpatrick, Hank Rushmere, Tom Christie, and Tony Butcher of the Thames Rowing Club, the organization that had won the 1947 and 1948 editions of the Stewards’ Challenge Cup at the Henley Royal Regatta. The favorites, however, were the Italian quartet of Giuseppe Moioli, Elio Morille, Giovanni Invernizzi, and Francesco Faggi, who were the reigning European Champions and would go on to hold that crown for two more years. These two nations were comfortably ahead of the rest of the pack in the opening round.
In the semifinals, however, the Britons were dealt a surprising defeat at the hands of the Danes, represented by Ib Storm Larsen, Helge Muxoll Schröder, Aksel Bonde, and Helge Halkjær, who exited the round with the fastest time. Also advancing to the final were Americans Bob Perew, Greg Gates, Stu Griffing, and Fred Kingsbury, although with a time that was nearly 30 seconds slower than either Italy or Denmark’s. The Italians led the pack for the entire race and, although the Danes were able to press them most of the time, they won the gold handily and left Denmark with a silver medal. The Americans, never a genuine threat, settled for bronze after finishing over four seconds behind the Danes.

Belarussian Darya Domracheva also only missed one target and took the silver medal ahead of Norwegian Tiril Eckhoff, who repeated her bronze medal performance from 2014.

The day after Majlinda Kelmendi won the first gold medal for Kosovo, the young country torn by ethnic rivalries, Rafaela Silva finally gained host country Brazil’s first gold medal, in the 57 kg class. But the main story behind Silva were her origins in the notorious favela (slum) Cidade de Deus (City of God) in Rio. It was there that the 2004 Olympic bronze medalist Flávio Canto founded a martial arts school which was to turn Silva into the world’s top judoka in her class. The 24-year-old was not really a surprise victor as she was the 2013 World Champion and a two-time gold medalist at the Pan American Games. However, prior to the Olympics she had dropped to 14 in the rankings. Silva had competed in London 2012 where she was disqualified for an illegal leg grab against Hedvig Karakas of Hungary. In Rio the two met again in the quarter-finals. This time, Silva scored a Waza-ari (half point) after 1:50 min, which proved to be sufficient to advance to the semi-final. After beating the second seed, Korean Kim Jan-Di, earlier in the tournament, in the final Silva faced the top-seeded Asian Champion Dorjsurengiin Sumiya. Again, an early Waza-ari for a Sumi-otoshi (corner drop) was decisive in winning gold.
Bronze medals went to Telma Monteiro of Portugal, a five-time European Champion, and Kaori Matsumoto of Japan, the reigning Olympic and World Champion. Both were defeated by Sumiya in the quarter-finals and semi-finals, respectively, of the elimination round.

The #1 seed was Serbia’s Ana Ivanović, who had recently moved up to the #1 world ranking, followed by her countrywoman, Jelena Janković. American sister superstars Serena and Venus Williams were seeded 4th and 7th, respectively, as they had both struggled with injuries in the past year, and were only returning to form.
OK, it was an open tournament, but nobody expected this semi-final. The semi-finalists were China’s Li Na, who would become one of the world’s top players but in 2008 had not yet advanced past the quarters-finals in a Grand Slam; and three Russians – Yelena Dementyeva, Dinara Safina, and Vera Zvonaryova. The top-seeded Russian was Svetlana Kuznetsova at #3, but she lost in round one to Li Na.
Both semi-finals were won in straight sets, with Dementyeva and Safina advancing to the final. Dementyeva won the gold medal with a three-set victory, 3-6, 7-5, 6-3. In the bronze medal match, Li Na was overwhelmed by Zvonaryova, 6-0, 7-5, as Russia unexpectedly swept the medals. A medal sweep in Olympic tennis last occurred in 1908, in three different events.

The big favorite was Marcel Hirscher, who had already won the Alpine combined and giant slalom in PyeongChang. He had won four of the last five World Cup Crystal Globes in slalom (2012/13, 2013/14, 2015/16, and 2016/17) and was also in the lead in the seasonal slalom World Cup. He was also the 2017 World Champion. His primary challenger was Henrik Kristoffersen, who won the slalom World Cup in 2015/16 and was also in second place in the slalom World Cup. These two were also the silver (Hirscher) and bronze (Kristoffersen) medalists from Sochi, while the gold medalist from four years ago, Mario Matt, had since retired. The two city events held this winter, which counted for the slalom World Cup, were won by André Myhrer and Ramon Zenhäusern. Also considered medal contenders were Michael Matt and Daniel Yule, who had had good seasonal performances.
Kristoffersen, bib #4, took the lead with a great run and when Hirscher started just behind him with bib #5 everyone expected an exciting battle, but Hirscher’s run ended after 22 seconds when he missed a gate. It was the first time in two years that he did not finish a slalom, since February 2016 in Naeba, Japan. The first run ended with Myhrer in second place only 0.21 seconds behind Kristoffersen and the surprise Victor Muffat-Jeandet in third. The first nine finishers up to Zenhäusern were within a second.
In the second run Matt, coming from 12th position, set the fastest run time and took the lead until Zenhäusern took the course, finishing only 0.01 seconds slower in this run, and topping the ranking 0.33 seconds ahead of Matt. In a thrilling race the Frenchmen Clément Noël, Alexis Pinturault, and also Muffat-Jeandet, all placed only a blink behind Matt. Myhrer, who was in second after the first run as in Sochi, when he went out in the second run, but this time he did much better and took the lead. So all eyes were on Kristoffersen, but he went out in 11 seconds, missing a gate like Hirscher, leaving gold for Myhrer.
After Mario Matt became the oldest ever slalom Olympic champion in Sochi, Myhrer set a new age record to become the oldest slalom gold medalist in Olympic history aged 35-042, only nine days younger than Aksel Lund Svindal in his downhill win seven days before. The silver for Zenhäusern was the Switzerland’s first Olympic medal in men’s slalom since Edy Reinalter won gold back in 1948.
With Michael Matt winning bronze, he continued the family tradition, after his brothers Andreas (silver in Vancouver) and Mario (gold in Sochi) had won medals at the previous Games to give the Matt family a full set of medals. The gold medal was the second for Sweden, after Ingemar Stenmark’s win in 1980, and, as Frida Hansdotter won gold six days earlier in the women’s slalom, both slalom golds went to Sweden. This was the second time in history a nation was able to win both slalom titles at the Olympics after Marielle Goitschel and Jean-Claude Killy respectively did so for France in 1968. Myhrer won the race using Head skis, while Zenhäusern and Matt both skied Rossignol.

Still, he had not won a major international since Los Angeles. Saito made it to the final against East German Henry Stöhr. The match was quite dull, with Saito winning by fewer passivity warnings, two to three. The two bronze medals were won by the last two World Champions, Grigory Verichev (URS-1987) and Jo Yong-Cheol (KOR-1985). Saito’s gold medal made him the second judoka to defend his Olympic title in Seoul, after Austria’s Peter Seisenbacher in the middleweight class. Prior to 1988, no judoka had defended an Olympic title.

Since Montreal they had experienced moderate success at the World Championships, winning gold in 1978 and silver in 1977 and 1979, but the East Germans remained a force by rowing to victory in the years that the Bulgarian duo were not victorious. That nation sent Cornelia Linse and Heidi Westphal, the reigning World Champions, to reassert their Olympic dominance.
In the opening round, however, both of these nations faltered to the benefit of the Soviet Union and Romania, who came in first and second in the heat that contained Bulgaria and East Germany. The Soviet Union, who had taken silver at the 1978 World Championships with a different duo, was represented by Yelena Khloptseva and Larisa Aleksandrova, while Romania sent Olga Homeghi and Valeria Roşca, bronze medalists at the most recent World Championships. The easier heat was won by Poland’s Hanna Jarkiewicz and Janina Klucznik. Proving that their performance was not a fluke, Khloptseva and Aleksandrova won the final in Olympic record time, while the East Germans rebounded and took silver. Romania slid in for a bronze medal comfortably ahead of the Bulgarians, who were unable to reach the podium, let alone defend their title.

Heiden started in the first pair, crossing in 2:13.10, an Olympic record and a personal best.

In the fifth pair, Visser’s teammate Annie Borckink was paired with Soviet 70s star Tatyana Barabash, who was no longer considered a challenger in this event. Borckink had been skating in Dutch meets since 1973 and had three times won the 1,000 at the Dutch Championships, but she had never won a distance at an international meet, and her best all-around finish in an international tournament was eighth at the 1977 World Championships. But she started well, although she was behind Visser’s time at 1,100 metres, only to finish very strongly, winning a surprising gold medal by 1.4 seconds with a time of 2:10.95. Borckink skated for one more year but never won another international distance race or tournament. Visser would continue to compete thru 1988, winning the Dutch Championships in 1983-85. The 1-2 finish by the Dutch women was a huge upset. Many years later, Visser would comment that the Dutch women were skating so poorly in 1980 that it was being considered not to enter a women’s team at Lake Placid.

Burke had died in January 2012 after a training accident in which she fell on her head at the Park City, Utah superpipe. She died nine days later from the effects of her head injury. In her memory, the skiiers tried to wear black armbands but the International Olympic Committee, in a petty ruling, would not allow that. Burke’s coach, Trennon Paynter did something better, spreading her ashes over the halfpipe course where they remain in the snow of Sochi as a tribute.
In Burke’s absence the favorite was American Maddie Bowman, who had won the superpipe at the last two Winter X-Games. Bowman came through under the pressure and won the inaugural freestyle halfpipe gold medal, followed by France’s Marie Martinod. Martinod was a 29-year-old mother of one who had been retired for several years until Burke called her to tell her that halfpipe was going to be an Olympic event. She had come out retirement to compete, though her performance made it hard to tell she had ever been away. The bronze went to Japan’s Ayana Onozuka who held the same spot at the 2013 World Championships.

The heavy favorite for the gold in Beijing was Irene Schouten, who had won the first two World Cups of the season by large margins, and had also claimed the European title in January. She had gotten close competition from compatriot Antoinette de Jong, the 2021 World Champion, and Francesca Lollobrigida, who had won the third 2021/2022 World Cup in Schouten’s absence.
The first contenders for a medal came in the third pair. Defending champion Carlijn Achtereekte, who had only narrowly qualified for the Dutch team, faced Miho Takagi, the 2018 all-around world champion. Despite challenge, Takagi led all the way to 4:01.77, dethroning Achtereekte. De Jong, in the first pair after the ice preparation break, attacked that time, but faded in the second half of her race and finished in 4:02.37, which eventually would bring her eighth place.
The 2010 champion Martina Sáblíková also attacked Takagi’s time, but managed to keep a gap of around one second, eventually finishing in 4:00.34. In pair nine, reigning 1,500 m World Champion Ragne Wiklund recorded the fastest time after 2,200 m, a second ahead of Sáblíková. But while Wiklund faded, her pairmate Isabelle Weidemann ended with two solid laps to become the first under 4 minutes with 3:58.64.
Per her usual tactics, Lollobrigida led from the start in the final pair, trailed by Schouten. Both were well below Weidemann’s pace halfway through the race. Schouten passed the Italian after 2 km, but Lollobrigida managed to cling on, and just 0.29 seconds separated the two at the bell. Schouten then powered away to a new Olympic Record (3:56.93), while Lollobrigida held on for silver – the first ever Olympic speed skating medal by an Italian woman.
Despite placing in the back of the field, 2002 champion Claudia Pechstein broke several records. This race meant her eighth Olympic Winter Games appearance, tying the record in any sport for most participations, held by Japanese ski jumper Noriaki Kasai. Just two weeks shy of her 50th birthday, she also became the oldest female winter Olympian, and the second-oldest Olympic speed skater (behind Albert Tebbit).

Their first round loss against New Zealand, in which they allowed more than one goal for the first time, was just an omen for the semi-finals, in which they were beaten by Australia. For the first time since 1928, the subcontinent was not represented in the Olympic hockey final. Like India, Pakistan needed three overtime periods in their semi-final, but they finally prevailed against West Germany. Their opponents for the gold medal, Australia, had three brothers on the team: Eric, Gordon and Julian (a fourth, Mel, was an Olympian in 1956). The Pakistani had Tanvir Dar playing, whose brother Munir Ahmed won the championship in 1960. Australian Brian Glencross tied the score 10 minutes into the second half, but Muhammad Asad Malik decided the match 10 minutes later.
Two other matches caught attention: in the preliminary round, Japan played India. The Indians were awarded a penalty stroke, which angered the Japanese. They walked off the field and forfeited, resulting in a default 5-0 victory for India. The match for fifth place, between Spain and the Netherlands, became the longest Olympic hockey match ever. Going into ten overtimes, it lasted 145 minutes, at which point Dutchman Kik Thole scored the only goal of the game.

The USA won the initial gold medal at Nagano, but Canada had won the next four gold medals (2002, 2006, 2010, 2014). The two nations were similarly dominant in international play as they always finished 1-2 at the World Championships, held since 1990.
The United States seemed to have the upper hand in the years preceding PyeongChang, winning the World Championships in 2013, 2015, 2016, and 2017. The two nations played several friendlies in the intervening four years, with the USA also winning more than they lost. In the last few months before PyeongChang, however, Canada won several consecutive games, and the gold medal seemed to be a toss-up.
Eight nations qualified for the Olympic tournament; five of them did automatically by virtue of their ranking by the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF), two by a qualification tournament, and the Koreans as hosts (their first ever Olympic ice hockey tournament). The South Korean women had trained for several years, with an American coach and several Korean-American and Korean-Canadian players. Shortly before the Games, the IOC negotiated with DPR Korea (North) to allow them to participate and it was agreed that North and South Korea would field a combined, mixed women’s ice hockey team. The team would have 35 players, well above the 23 maximum, although only 22 would dress for each match.
Some of the South Korean players were unhappy, feeling that they would lose playing time. In the end, the mixed Korean team lost all its matches, although it acquitted itself well, and the international goodwill that the mixed Korean team generated made up for any untoward or hurt feelings. The two Koreas competing together on a playing field was historic for the Olympic Movement and the Korean Peninsula.
To avoid Canada and the USA dominating pool play by too great a margin, they were placed together in pool A, with Canada winning the pool when they defeated the Americans 2-1. The top two teams in pool A qualified for the semi-finals, with the third team and the top three teams from pool B facing each other in a knock-out round to advance to the semis. As expected Canada and the United States easily won their semi-final matches, both teams winning 5-0, over OAR and Finland, respectively.
The gold medal final was closely matched, with Canada taking a 2-1 lead after two periods. In the final period the United States’ Monique Lamoureux tied the match with 6:21 left and that score held through the end of regulation play. An overtime period ensued, but neither team could score, so they went to penalty shots. After four rounds that shoot-out was also tied at 2-2, when Monique’s twin sister Jocelyn Lamoureux-Davidson netted her shot, and when Meghan Agosta’s penalty shot was stopped by US goalie Maddie Rooney, the United States had finally won an Olympic gold, 20 years after their first and last one. The loss ended Canada’s record-setting Olympic winstreak of 24 games, but it took a classic to do it.
In the bronze medal game, Finland had a two-goal lead twice and held off the Russians (OAR) in the third period after they had narrowed the margin to one. Finland had now won three Olympic medals in women’s ice hockey, all of them bronze (Vancouver 2010, Nagano 1998).

Charles Schlee, a well-known rider from the National Turnverein in Newark, New Jersey, rode in last place through most of the race as was his custom, relying on his excellent finish.  However, because of the crowded field he could not get through the field to make a chase for the championship.  On the home stretch, Hurley’s cycle slipped on the dusty cinder track and he was passed by both Downing and Goerke.  Downing won by approximately one wheel over Goerke with Hurley in third place, defeating Billington by a length.

He wanted to double at the Olympics in the 1,500 and 5,000 but the schedule came out with the finals only 55 minutes apart. He still elected to attempt the double. Although he hurt his knee a few weeks before the Olympics, his punishing training program allowed him to recover quickly and three weeks before the Olympics, he broke his 1,500 world record with a time of 3:52.6. At the Olympics, he qualified for the 5,000 final on 8 July, and easily won his 1,500 heat the next day. The two finals were on the evening of 10 July. Nurmi had little opposition in this event, as runners were effectively avoiding him and opting for other distances. In the 1,500 final Nurmi went thru 800 in 1:58.5 and only America’s Ray Watson was still with him. But Watson fell back before the end of the second lap (the track was 500 metres) and Nurmi concentrated then only on conserving energy for the 5K. He won the race with Switzerland’s Willy Schärer second, about 12 metres behind. The bronze medalist, Henry Stallard, sustained a stress fracture in his foot during the heats, but ran the final in pain. Less than 45 minutes later, Nurmi returned to the Colombes Stadium track and won the 5,000 metres.

The Tanzanians finished the tournament with an average of nearly 10 goals against, losing 18-0 to India.
The best nations were Spain and India, fifth and sixth at the 1978 World Championships. In the preliminary round-robin, Spain and India tied two all. Because of another Indian draw against Poland, Spain topped the tables. In the final, the two teams met again, but now India was the better team. After gaining a 3-0 lead, they held Spain to a 4-3 defeat. The bronze medal was won by the Soviet Union, which had never before played Olympic hockey, and had only qualified on account of being the host nation.

In the final, Yuliya Gushchina  put Russia in the lead on the opening leg with 50.62, Jamaica second and the US third. Allyson Felix ran the second leg for the US, and blitzed a 48.55 lap to move slightly ahead of the Russians at the second changeover. Monique Henderson  ran the third leg for the US and opened a big lead on the backstretch but Tatyana Firova caught her on the straightaway and pulled ahead by a few metres as she handed the baton to Anastasiya Kapachinskaya.

But Richards held on to get the gold for the US by 0.28 seconds, with Jamaica winning the bronze medal.
That was how the event and the results seemed to have ended. In 2015, however, the IOC began re-testing samples from the 2008 Beijing and 2012 London Olympics, using newer, more advanced testing techniques, in an effort to find those who had used performance enhancing drugs (PEDs), but in whom it could not be detected at the time of those Olympics. This was one of the many events affected.
Russia originally received the silver medal, but two of their runners, Tatyana Firova and Anastasiya Kapachinskaya, both had positive re-tests for turinabol (dehydrochloromethyltestosterone), with Firova also testing positive for 3a-hydroxy-5a-androst-1-en-17-one, and Kapachinskaya throwing in a stanozolol chaser. The Russian team was disqualified, all runners losing their silver medal, with Jamaica moving up to the silver medal, and Great Britain receiving the bronze medal. Great Britain had originally finished only fifth, with Belarus fourth. However, Belarus was also disqualified after the re-test of Svetlana Usovich, who was positive for turinabol (dehydrochloromethyltestosterone) in November 2016.
Firova was later quoted as saying, “We sportsmen are performers, we follow the rules that are given to us by the system. A normal person can take banned substances if they want to. So why can’t athletes take them as well? How else can we achieve high results?”

Relatively unknown, she surprised with 46.3, giving the United States a three-way tie for the silver medals, as Titova held on for the gold.

In Sollefteå, Sweden 1934, Finland won, but Artur Häggblad (Sweden) and Oddbjørn Hagen (Norway) on the anchor leg went off course and lost 10 minutes, allowing Germany to take the silver. In 1935 Finland won again in a tough fight against Norway.
The relay was the first Nordic skiing event in the 1936 Games. Sixteen teams were entered, far more than in the World Championships 1933-1935. Finland had two of their world champions from 1935 on their team, Sulo Nurmela and Klaes Karppinen, anchorman from 1935.  Nurmela was now selected for the first leg. Norway had an almost identical team as the silver lineup from 1935, the only difference being that Trygve Brodahl was replaced by his younger brother, Sverre.  The Norwegians also put their anchorman from 1935, Hagen, on the opening leg.
The cross-country relay developed into one of the most thrilling events of the Games. On the first leg Hagen, skiing for Norway, pulled away from Nurmela and Sweden’s John Berger when they both fell, and had a one minute lead on Finland and Sweden at the exchange.  On the second leg, Olaf Hoffsbakken increased Norway’s lead to 1:23. Erik Larsson was able to catch Karppinen and brought Sweden into silver position, closely followed by Finland. On the third leg Brodahl passed the relay over to Bjarne Iversen with a 1:22 lead ahead of Finland, with Sweden almost another minute back, seemingly out of contention for the gold. On Finland’s anchor leg Kalle Jalkanen had noticed that Iversen, the less merited skier on the Norwegian team, was a good technician on the easier part of the course, but his weak point was obviously uphill. The first half of the course was mostly uphill, and Jalkanen decided to give all he had from the start. His tactics succeeded. He caught the nervous Iversen halfway, they stayed together for another 2-3 km., and then Jalkanen made his final move and was able to leave Iversen 30 m. behind. The winning margin for Finland was 6 seconds.
Jalkanen was the hero of the day with the fastest leg time of all participants. Two years later he was celebrated as world champion over 50 km. on his home ground in Lahti, but on September 5th 1941 he was killed in action on the Kareleian Isthmus in the Continuation War against Soviet Union.

Of the original 18 entered teams only 16 actually competed with South Africa withdrawing as Henri Schoeman had broken an ankle while running the individual race. Austria resigned shortly before the start due to an Achilles’ tendon injury to Lisa Perterer. The Tokyo individual champions Kristian Blummenfelt and Flora Duffy could not compete, as their nations did not qualify enough triathletes. The weather was fine in the early morning, but again very warm with air and water temperatures of 28 degrees each.
As expected, all of the top nations had their best female swimmers in the first starting position. Britain’s Jess Learmonth came out of the water first, but the field was close together. A top quartet formed on the bike, opening a gap of just under 30 seconds on the pursuers. Learmonth finished the run in first place, while the German Laura Lindemann handed over to Jonas Schomburg in second place who passed Britain’s Jonathan Brownlee in the transition area and was the first to dive into water.
The German swam in the lead, with Brownlee, American Kevin McDowell and Dutchman Marco van der Stel in tow. The four then went on the bike course together, while the first chasing group with France, Belgium, and Italy was still half a minute behind. Brownlee then picked up the pace in the run and quickly dropped his three associates and handed over the baton to Georgia Taylor-Brown as sole leader. Behind the top group the Frenchman Dorian Coninx was almost able to close up with a strong run and Belgium, with Marten Van Riel, was only a few seconds behind.
Taylor-Brown extended the lead in swimming ahead of the American Taylor Knibb. A group formed behind them in the battle for third place after the Frenchwoman Cassandre Beaugrand was able to completely close the small gap in swimming and advanced to second place. Taylor-Brown dominated cycling as the leader and finished the section with a gap of 11 seconds. At the last change, Taylor-Brown handed over to Alex Yee, who was 21 seconds ahead of the USA, and with France and Vincent Luis 33 seconds behind in third.
The preliminary decision about the medallists had now been made, and only the order of the medals remained uncertain. Luis tried everything to bring the victory to France. He closed the gap to the American Morgan Pearson and even distanced him near the end of the swim. He chased Britain but Yee was too strong. Leading on the run, Alex Yee brought the gold medal home for Great Britain, while behind him Luis had to pay for his attacks, as Pearson caught up with him again on the first running lap and secured the silver medal for the United States.

Sheffield Speed Skating Oval, Lake Placid",12 from 2 countries,40.5 km. course,na,"The 1932 sled dog race demonstration was conducted under the rules of the New England Sled Dog Club. It consisted of two races on successive days over a 25.1 mile (40.5 km) course, with the total time determining the winner. Intermediate times were taken at 4 miles, 10.6 miles, and 22.46 miles (at John Brown’s Farm - the famous abolitionist). There were only teams from Canada and the United States, with five from Canada and seven from the United States.
The race started and finished at the Olympic Stadium. The course was as follows: north to Mirror Lake, then along the Northwood Road to Wilmington Road, along River Road to Midrivers Farm, following the Bridle Path to return to River Road at Intervales Farm, along River Road for ½-mile, turning left on Bolderwood bridle path loop, coming out on Cascade Road south of Ski T, turning left on Cascade Road to Adirondack Lodge Road, to a point ¼-mile past Alcohol Brook, right along the bridle path to Tablelands Farm, to John Brown’s Farm, and along the bridle path on Cascade Road back to the stadium. The race was extremely popular and the papers noted that the course was lined by spectators.
The racers went off at three-minute intervals on each day, with each sled pulled by seven dogs, a lead dog and six dogs in pairs. The two greatest sled dog racers in the world in 1932 were Manitoba’s Émile St. Godard and Alaska’s Leonhard Seppala, and they would finish one-two, with St. Godard besting Seppala by eight total minutes, and winning both of the races. Canada dominated, taking five of the first seven places. In the first race, one of Seppala’s dogs collapsed five miles from the finish and was carried over the line in the sled. Roger Haines finished the first race, but after crossing the line, collapsed unconscious from exhaustion.
One non-starter was Earl Bunnell, who raced Irish Setter dogs for his team, which was rather unusual. He was not allowed to start after a protest by Eva “Short” Seeley, who insisted that only Huskies or Malamutes should be allowed to race, because of the rigors of the trail.

She was US Champion five times in a row between 1952 and 1956, and was World Champion in 1953 and 1955. In 1954, however, she was beaten in the World Championships by the 18-year-old German star Gundi Busch, but Gundi chose to turn professional in 1955 and was then not eligible to start in the Cortina Olympics. Albright’s closest opponent was supposed to be a new rising US star, 16-year old Carol Heiss from Queens, NY. She came second to Albright in the 1955 World Championships and the US championships in 1953-55 and was steadily improving. Two weeks before the Olympics Albright fell during training in Cortina d’Ampezzo and seriously injured her right ankle from the blade of her left skate. Her father, a well-known Massachusetts surgeon, came to Italy two days later and was able to patch her up successfully.
The Olympic competition turned out to be a close battle between the two Americans, but Albright was able to edge out Heiss both in the compulsory figures and the free skating. The bronze medal was won by the newly crowned European Champion of 1956, the 15-year old Viennese Ingrid Wendl, who in 2002 was elected as a Member of the Austrian Parliament.
A week after the Olympics, Carol Heiss won the World Championship, after another very close battle with the newly crowned  Olympic Champion Albright, who decided to finish her figure skating career after the 1956 season, giving priority to her medical studies at Harvard. Like her father, she later became a surgeon. Heiss competed while knowing that her mother was dying of cancer and it would likely be the last time she would see her compete at the Olympics. She was not from a wealthy family, and the sacrifices the family made for her made most people think she would turn professional after the 1956 Cortina Olympics. But she promised her mother she would remain an amateur to win a gold medal for her at the 1960 Winter Olympics. Two weeks later, Heiss defeated Albright at the 1956 World Championships in Garmisch-Partenkirchen. Her mother died in October 1956, but Heiss would make good on her promise, become the greatest skater since Sonja Henie, and win the 1960 gold medal. She would also marry the 1956 men’s gold medalist, Hayes Alan Jenkins.

In that round Petkov and Nystrom drew, as did Nystrom and Dubicki, which meant that Kolesov’s victory by decision over Dubicki was the determining factor to give Kolesov the gold medal. Petkov won the silver medal over Nystrom based on lower bodyweight. Kolesov was World Champion in 1962-63 and would win again in 1965.

In the third pair, 17-year-old West German Monika Pflug came through in 1:31.40. Henning and Titova were together in the next pair, and Henning later said that her legs still felt the effect of taking two runs in the 500 the day before, after she had been interfered with on her first run. But she still narrowly defeated Titova, 1:31.62 to 1:31.85, but did not catch Pflug. Both were also beaten by Atje Keulen-Deelstra, skating in the next pair, who finished in 1:31.61, which would hold up for the silver medal, Henning getting bronze. The gold medal went to Pflug in a major upset. Her win was especially impressive because she had jump started twice, and started very slowly to avoid disqualification on the third gun. Her 200 split was only 13th fastest, but she was second at the 600 split, and finished strongly. She would have a very long career, competing thru 1988, five Winter Olympics, and three names, eventually as Monika Gawenus-Holzner-Pflug, but this would be her only Olympic medal.

Defections to professional boxing, the further rise of ex-Soviet nations and a change to the points system that many thought worked against the Cuban “punch and move away” style threatened the Caribbean nation’s place as the best of the best in the sport.
Julio César La Cruz had been the star of the Cuban boxing since before the 2012 Olympics.
A three time world champion and two time Pan American Games gold medallist, the only thing missing from his CV was an Olympic title. His progress to the final was as smooth as possible with three successive wins where he won every round on each judge’s scorecard. 
His opponent in the gold medal match would be Adilbek Niyazymbetov of Kazakhstan who won silver in London four years earlier. The Cuban fighter stuck to his plan of whipping in quick blows and darting away to great effect in the first two rounds and, although the increasingly desperate attacks of the Kazakh were more effective in the last three minutes, it was enough to give Cuba the first of what would eventually be three boxing titles in Rio.
La Cruz was hit by a bullet above his left hip in his home town of Camaguey in 2014 while leaving a restaurant.
Mathieu Bauderlique of France and Joshua Buatsi of Great Britain won the bronze medals.

But normally, the 1500 m was the domain of the German woman, notably Gunda Niemann-Stirnemann, who had won three of the four World Cup races that year, as well as the 1997 World Championships. The remaining World Cup race had been won by defending champion Emese Hunyady of Austria. Other medal hopefuls were Anni Friesinger, Claudia Pechstein and Chris Witty.

On a sunny, warm day, France’s Pierre Jonquères d’Oriola was one of five riders to have a total of 8.00 faults for his two rounds. In the jump-off, which was held over six raised obstacles, Jonquères d’Oriola went clear, with no faults, the only rider to do so, which won him the gold medal. Chile’s Óscar Cristi had only 4.00 faults in the jump-off, which brought him the silver medal. Cristi would also lead Chile to a silver medal in team jumping, and the two silver medals remain the only equestrian medals won by Chile at the Olympics through 2012. The bronze medal was decided on time, as both Germany’s Fritz Thiedemann and Brazil’s Eloy de Menezes had 8.00 faults in the jump-off, but Thiedemann’s time of 38.5 was 6.5 seconds faster than de Menezes’ and brought him the silver medal.
Jonquères d’Oriola would return and win another gold medal in this event in 1964, and he won the 1966 World Championships. Thiedemann would win team jumping gold medals in 1956 and 1960. At Helsinki, he won two bronze medals, one in this event, and one in team dressage.

In addition, he had won the World Sprint Championships in January, winning both 1000 metres in that competition. But his fall in the Olympic 500 m had apparently shattered Wotherspoon’s self-confidence, and in the 1,000 m he placed an anonymous 12th.
As it turned out, the American and Dutch skaters were most ready to fill the gap Wotherspoon left, as they wound up taking places one through seven. The least likely of these seven to win was probably Gerard van Velde. The dominant Dutch sprinter of the 1990s, he had been unlucky in international competition. At the 1992 Olympics, he had placed 4th and 5th at just hundredths from the podium. He was unable to adapt to the clap skates in 1998, and retired. Coming out of retirement, he again reached the world top, but again placed fourth at the 2002 World Sprint Championships and in the Olympic 500 m.

A seventh world crown for Italian Eugenio Monti in 1966 was sandwiched between victories for Great Britain in 1965 and a first ever world title for Austria on the Olympic track in 1967. Added to the list of possible challengers were the West German bobs driven by Horst Floth and Wolfgang Zimmerer  along with bobs from Switzerland, Romania, Canada and the USA.
At forty years of age Eugenio Monti  was not the dominant force he had been in earlier years but on the first run at L’Alpe d’Huez he recaptured his form of the early part of the decade and posted a track record in taking the lead ahead of Romania I and Great Britain I.
The second run was won by Horst Floth  of West Germany but at the end of the first day Monti had increased his lead to a third of a second. The competition had already been delayed for a day due to adverse weather conditions and the concluding two runs were to be held on the 11th February, three days after originally scheduled.  A stunning third run from Floth meant that West Germany leapt to the top of the standings with a tenth of the second to spare over their Italian rivals. Starting early on the final run Monti shot down the track and smashed the track record with a time of 1:10.05 then had to suffer a long wait until the leaders came down the course. Floth made an excellent start but lost vital fractions of time later down the track. As the German pair crossed the finish line the clock stopped at 1:10.15 and the gold medal appeared to be shared between West Germany and Italy. Shortly afterwards, with the Germans already celebrating, a loudspeaker announcement broke the news that regulations stated that in the event of a tie the crew that recorded the fastest single run would be regarded as champions.
Whilst this was a cruel blow to Floth  and Bader  there was a genuine feeling of delight that the efforts of Eugenio Monti, four times previously a medallist but never Olympic champion, had been rewarded with a place on the top of the podium in his final year of competition. Third place finishers were the crew from Romania who became the first Eastern European Olympic bobsleigh medallists and, as of 2010, the only Romanians to have won a medal at the Winter Games.

The mark of 2:56.16 was altitude aided, but would last until it was equaled at the 1988 Olympics by another US relay team and it would not be broken until the 1992 Barcelona Olympics. Despite the acclaim given to Bob Beamon’s long jump mark, this was the world record from Ciudad de México that lasted for the longest period of time. The US actually did not lead on the opening leg, as Charles Asati put Kenya four metres ahead of Vince Matthews. But the outcome was settled on the second leg when 400 bronze medalist Ron Freeman ran 43.2, the fastest leg to that time, and still a remarkable time. With Larry James, the 400 silver medalist, and Lee Evans, the gold medalist, running the last two legs, the race was over.

In addition to Ohno, Seong Si-Baek of South Korea was a contender, having held the world record in the distance since 2007, with 40.651. All three favorites reached the final with little trouble. Hamelin made the best impression, clocking two sub-41-second times and bettering the Olympic Record. The trio was complemented by a second Canadian, François-Louis Tremblay.
The final was, as expected, a closely contested affair. Seong went into the final curve first, and seemed headed for the gold medal. But he then stumbled, possibly after a slight touch of Hamelin, and crashed out of the curve. Hamelin nearly fell, but kept on his feet, crossing the line first nearly backwards. Behind these two, Tremblay had also fallen, due to interference from Ohno, who had finished second behind Hamelin. For this, the American was disqualified, and the silver medal went to Seong, who had quickly recovered, and the bronze to Tremblay.

The Americans, 2009’s world champions, arrived at Vancouver as World Cup winners having dominated the first half of the season whilst Lange had swept the last four races of the series. The Latvian crew who placed between the USA and Germany in the standings did not compete in Vancouver as driver Jānis Miņins had his appendix removed shortly before the Olympics began. Lyndon Rush driving Canada I, the only other victor of the year’s World Cup besides Lange and Holcomb, was also expected to be a force to reckon with in his home country.
Arguments over the course came to the fore again as the Netherlands crew pulled out of the event prior to the start citing issues over safety after the van Calker brothers had withdrawn from the team due to a crisis of confidence whilst Australia were forced to withdraw as they had simply ran out of athletes fit enough to compete. Nevertheless the event went ahead, and was dominated by the United States I crew driven by Steve Holcomb, who had the fastest time on each of the first three runs. Lyndon Rush, driving the Canada I bobsleigh was in second in each of the first three runs, and the Germany I bobsleigh, driven by Two Man bobsleigh gold medallist André Lange, was third in each of the first three runs. However, on the last run, Germany I put in a tremendous time, the fastest of the run. This put pressure on the Canadian crew and, although theirs was the second fastest time, their combined time of 3:24.85 was just 0.01 seconds behind Lange’s crew. Holcomb was only third fastest on the final run, but still maintained his overall lead to win by 0.38 seconds. Interestingly this was the first time Lange and his team mate Kevin Kuske had not won the gold medal when entering an Olympic bobsleigh event!
Holcomb’s USA I bob was a distinctive sight in the bobsleigh world. With a distinctive jet black paint job the bob and crew had become known as the “Night Train” and had even cashed in with a range of merchandising based around this image. Their victory was the first by a male American crew since the long ago days of the first post-war Winter Games in 1948. Holcomb’s victory was more remarkable as in 2007-08 he was having progressive loss of vision and was threatened with blindness due to a condition called keratoconus. It led him to contemplate suicide but a surgery restored his vision.

In the category Dramatic Works no gold and bronze medals were awarded, only a silver one. This was won by Paulo maiora canamus, real name Lauro Adolfo de Bosis, for his lyric drama Icarus, an Italian meter (11 syllables), which was inspired by Charles Lindbergh’s trans-oceanic flight. The work was published in 1930 in Milano, and was also translated into English and French.

19012042,"Football, Women",2020 Summer Olympics,61,Football,/editions/61/sports/FBL,21 July –  6 August 2021,"International Stadium Yokohama, Yokohama, Japan / Kashima Stadium, Kashima, Ibaraki Prefecture, Japan / Miyagi Stadium, Rifu, Miyagi Prefecture, Japan / Saitama Stadium 2002, Saitama, Saitama Prefecture, Japan / Sapporo Dome, Sapporo, Hokkaido, Japan / Tokyo Stadium, Tokyo, Japan",228 from 12 countries,Round-robin pools advance teams to single-elimination tournament of four teams.,na,"The defending champions Germany failed to qualify for Tokyo 2020 after losing to Sweden in the quarter-finals in the 2019 FIFA Women’s World Cup, which acted as a qualifier for the Olympics. That made the United States, with four Olympic, and four FIFA Women’s World Cup titles to their credit, clear favourites for the gold medal in Tokyo. They went into the 2020 Games with a 44-game unbeaten run, and had not conceded a goal in six consecutive games. The USA were also favourites in Rio four years earlier, but it was the only time an American women’s team had failed to reach the Olympic final, when they were beaten on penalties by Sweden in the quarter-final. By coincidence, the opening round of fixtures in Tokyo saw the USA and Sweden kicking off group G. At the age of 39, Carli Lloyd was playing in her fourth Olympics, and went into the Tokyo Games with 306 international caps and 126 goals to her credit.
New Zealand were in the same group as the USA and they had four experienced “Football Ferns” in Abby Erceg, Ria Percival, Anna Green, and Ali Riley who were all competing in their fourth Olympics at Tokyo. The team also contained two members of New Zealand’s bronze medal winning Under-17 World Cup side in striker Gabi Rennie and goalkeeper Anna Leat.
The best of the European countries were the three that finished below the United States in the 2019 FIFA Women’s World Cup: Netherlands, Sweden and England (playing as Great Britain in Tokyo). In Vivianne Miedema, the Netherlands, the 2017 European champions, had one the biggest names in women’s football in their ranks. She played her club football with Arsenal and, with 60 goals, was the all-time leading English Women’s Super League goalscorer. Up to the start of the tournament, her 73 goals in 96 international appearances also made her Netherlands’ leading women’s goalscorer.
The youngest player was Esther Siamfuko of Zambia, who was just 16 when the tournament started, while the oldest was Brazil midfielder Formiga, who was 43 years 140 days when she played in Brazil’s 5-0 win over China on the opening day in Tokyo. This was Formiga’s seventh tournament, and she had played in every women’s tournament since it was added to the Olympic programme in 1996. Brazil also had the experienced Marta playing alongside her, and both were keen to go one better than the two silver medals they both won in 2004 and 2008.
Swedish-born coach Pia Sundhage guided the USA to Olympic victory in 2008 and 2012, and then led her home country to that quarter-final victory over the Americans, and ultimately a place in the final in Rio. Now she was in charge of Brazil, who were looking for their first women’s title. They were beaten finalists in 2004 and 2008, when Sundhage was the victorious USA coach.
Great Britain kicked the women’s tournament off with a 2-0 win over Olympic newcomers Chile, thanks to two goals from Ellen White. The big shock of day one, however, was the United States losing their unbeaten run to their old foes Sweden. The Europeans were the better side and ran out impressive 3-0 winners, and after just one game were looking like potential gold medallists.
The two newcomers Netherlands and Zambia met each other on the opening day and engaged in a record-breaking match. With Netherlands winning 10-3, they were the first women’s team to score 10 goals in the competition proper, and the 13 goals was the highest aggregate score for a single game. Also, Vivianne Miedema became only the second person after Birgit Prinz of Germany in 2004 to score four goals in a game, and Zambia’s 21-year-old captain Babra Banda, a former professional boxer, became only the second woman after Christine Sinclair (Canada) in 2012 to be on the losing side after scoring a hat-trick. She also became the first female African player to score three goals at the Olympics, and it was also the first time two women had scored hat-tricks in the same game.
In the second round of group games, China’s Wang Shuang emulated Miedema’s feat of scoring four goals in one game, in the 4-4 draw with Zambia. Barbra Banda scored three goals for Zambia and became the first woman to score consecutive hat-tricks at the Olympics. The much-awaited match between Netherlands and Brazil ended in a 3-3- draw, which meant only Sweden and Great Britain had maximum points going into the final group games.
With so much at stake in the final games, it was not surprising that goals were not as forthcoming as they had been in the opening two rounds of matches, but that was a script Netherlands did not bother reading. They scored another eight goals in beating China 8-2 to take their tally from their opening three games to 21 goals, with Miedema scoring twice to take her individual total to eight, surpassing the previous record of six in one tournament by Christine Sinclair in 2012.
Sweden progressed to the knockout stage as the only team with a 100% record while Great Britain lost theirs after drawing 1-1 with Canada, but still topped their group. The Netherlands were the other team to top their group while Brazil, USA and Canada all qualified for the next stage as runners-up, and Australia and Japan went through as the two best third-placed teams.
The opening quarter-final game saw Brazil and Canada play out a goalless draw after 120 minutes and the game was resolved on penalties, which the North Americans won 4-3, and defeated Brazil for the second consecutive Olympics, having beaten them in the bronze medal match in Rio. There was no repeat of the goalless draw in the Australia and Great Britain game. Australia led before going 2-1 behind and then equalised in the 89th minute. Great Britain had a penalty saved in extra time before the Australians netted two quick goals and, despite Ellen White completing her hat-trick, ran out 4-3 winners. Two of Australia’s goals came from Chelsea’s Samantha Kerr, the top scorer in the English Women’s Super League in the 2020-21 season. It was the first time an Australian team had reached the semi-final since the men’s team at Barcelona in 1992, and it was the first time ever that the women’s team had reached the last four.
Sweden reached their second successive semi-final with a 3-1 win over Japan while the Netherlands versus USA match was the third quarter-final to go to extra-time. In a repeat of the 2019 FIFA Women’s World Cup, Miedema, playing in her 100th international, scored two more goals, to take her total for the tournament to ten. The game ended in a 2-2 draw at the end of extra time with the USA winning 4-2 on penalties, with Miedema having her first penalty saved. For the USA, it was their sixth semi-final in seven Olympic tournaments.
The United States failed to reach the women’s final for the second consecutive Olympics and only for the second time since the women’s game joined the Olympic programme in 1996. Despite having most of the play in their semi-final against Canada, they succumbed to a 73rd minute penalty converted by Jessie Fleming. Having been bronze medallists in both 2012 and 2016, Canada were assured of going at least one better in Tokyo, and victory was also sweet revenge for a 4-3 defeat by the USA at London 2012. Standing in Canada’s way of deciding ff they won silver or gold was Sweden, who beat Australia with a goal in the first minute of the second half, shortly after Australia had a goal disallowed, to defeat the first-time semi-finallists. For Sweden, they were in back-to-back finals and they wanted to go one better than the silver they won when they lost to Germany in Rio.
The bronze medal match started with three quick goals and after 21 minutes the USA were 2-1 up on Australia before adding a third right on half time. The goals kept coming in the second half, and after 51 minutes the USA had extended their lead to 4-1 with a second goal from Carli Lloyd. The “Matildas” pulled one back three minutes later and just on 90 minutes scored again to make it a nervous last few minutes for the Americans, who held out for victory and the bronze medal, to go with their collection of four golds and one silver.
The Swedish team was full of world class footballers and were favourites to improve on their silver medal finish at Rio. The Canadians, however, had enjoyed bronze medals at the last two Olympics and, like the Swedes, had reached the final without losing a game. The final was switched to Yokohama because of the state of the Tokyo pitch. The kick-off time was also moved from 1100 (local time) to 2100 because of concerns over the midday heat in Tokyo.
Sweden’s Stina Blackstenius opened the scoring on 34 minutes with the 100th goal of the 2020 tournament, before another Jessie Fleming penalty, confirmed by VAR, levelled the scores midway through the second half. It stayed at 1-1 up to the end of the 30 minutes extra period and then the game was decided on penalties with Canada coming from 2-1 down to win 3-2, with Julia Grosso converting the winning spot kick to give Canada their first Olympic gold medal, and Sweden had to be content with silver for the second successive Games.

The fourth country in Beijing, North Korea, had elected not to send a team to Norway, leaving a spot for the American team, which then promptly made the final. The Canadians led the race from the early laps, followed by China, with a large gap over Korea and the US. With 10 on the lap counter, Christine Boudrias slipped away coming out of a turn, and crashed into the boards. This left China with a seemingly insurmountable lead.
But South Korea, which had sent a team of girls between 13 and 18 years old, shifted gears and pulled closer, catching up with China with five laps left. At three laps from the end, 13-year-old Kim Yun-Mi took over the lead, and the Koreans never let go. The Koreans finished 0.08 seconds outside the World Record to win the gold, making Kim Yun-Mi the youngest ever female Olympic gold medallist. China finished as second, while the Canadians had recovered quickly enough to stay ahead of the US. China’s joy over their silver medal lasted 45 minutes, when the referees announced the Chinese had been disqualified: One of the inactive Chinese skaters had caused a member of the American team to fall. The Canadians and Americans moved up one spot, earning the Americans a medal while they had not even been supposed to compete.

The current record of 35.36 had been set by the local favorite for the gold, Hiroyasu Shimizu. He had won the World Championships in 1996, the 500 m World Cup in 1995 and 1997, and had medaled three times at the World Sprint Championships on account of his 500 m results. He had not done particular well in the Olympic season, though, winning only the first World Cup race in Roseville. Top challenger was Canadian Jeremy Wotherspoon, who had won four World Cup races and was runner-up at the World Sprint Championships earlier in the season.
The 1994 Olympic Record was broken in the very first pair, and eventually improved to 35.76 by Shimizu, who won the first run with that time. Trailing by just 0.02 seconds was Kevin Overland (Canada), followed by American Casey FitzRandolph, with 35.81. Also in contention for a medal were Sylvain Bouchard (Canada), Patrick Bouchard (Canada) and Erben Wennemars (Netherlands). With 36.04, Wotherspoon was considered too far off the lead to threaten Shimizu. The first of the leaders to race on the second day, he disproved that theory, setting what would turn out to be the second fastest time of the day (35.80), good enough to climb to the 2nd place in the rankings.
Fifth-placed Erben Wennemars was eliminated by his falling pairmate Grunde Njøs and had to be stretchered off. Overland, and the two Bouchards (not related) all posted times slower than 36 seconds, and fell in the rankings, as did FitzRandolph, who only clocked the 13th time of the day. This gave room for Shimizu to collect a much applauded gold medal, but he did so in style, setting the best time of the competition with 35.59. Later that year, Shimizu became the first skater to beat 35 seconds in the 500 m, lowering the world best to 34.82.

On the first run, Stenmark appeared tentative and was placed only third, trailing the leader, Liechtenstein’s Andreas Wenzel, and the silver medalist at the 1978 Worlds. But his second run was dominant, besting Switzerland’s Jacques Lüthy by almost a full second, and it brought Stenmark the expected gold medal. Wenzel hung on for the silver, with the bronze going to Austria’s Hans Enn.

The leader after the compulsory figures was Czechoslovakian Karol Divín, 1958-59 European Champion, with Jenkins second. But Jenkins won the free skate easily, Divín placed only fifth in that phase, and the gold medal went to the Jenkins’ family for the second consecutive Winter Olympics.

Hungary were the pre-tournament favourites, and they survived the group stage with ease. But the 1952 champions were halted by the surprising Danish amateur side. Denmark was playing with a depleted squad and heavy hearts, as eight Danish footballers had died in a plane crash shortly before the 1960 Olympic tournament, but in an exciting semi-final, where both sides missed a penalty kick, Denmark came out the deserved winner with 2-0. The other semi-final was a much closer affair. The home team, Italy, was paired with Yugoslavia. The Italians had kicked out Brazil in the first round, while Yugoslavia had held off Bulgaria only on goal difference after a 3-3 tie. Italy, which featured future star Gianni Rivera and Giovanni Trapattoni, later a successful manager, was cheered on by an ecstatic home crowd in Naples. But after 120 minutes of play, both teams were still tied. In earlier Olympics, such draws would be resolved by a replay, but this method was found to be unsatisfactory in the busy Olympic programme. The present-day tie-breaker of taking penalties was not yet in use either, and the winner was determined by lot. Yugoslavia won this draw, and progressed to their fourth consecutive Olympic final.
In the decider, Yugoslavia got off to an excellent start and took a 2-0 lead. Shortly before half-time, a third goal was scored by Kostić. Although the linesman had not signalled for offside, the Italian referee annulled the goal, much to the anger of the Yugoslav captain, Milan Galić . His uncontrolled response to the referee resulted in an expulsion, leaving his team short-handed for the rest of the match. But Yugoslavia held on for their first Olympic gold medal, while Denmark took its third Olympic silver.

Switzerland’s Fabian Bösch and Sweden’s Oliwer Magnusson, the 2019 and 2021 World Champions respectively, were both veterans of the 2018 PyeongChang Olympic slopestyle event, with Bösch having also competed in 2014. Czech-born Austrian skier Matěj Švancer had won big air at the 2020 Winter Youth Olympics, as well as the two times that it had been held at the World Cup in the past season.
The qualifying round did not go as expected, as both Bösch and Švancer experienced difficulties that prevented them from reaching the final. The top scorer was Birk Ruud of Norway, the 2016 Youth Winter Olympic slopestyle champion and 2019 World runner-up. Magnusson was third and in-between was Alex Hall of the United States, who had a silver medal in slopestyle from the 2016 Winter Youth Olympics and bronze from the most recent World Championships.
Ruud set the bar high in the first run of the final, scoring the highest total in the entire event. This put pressure on the other competitors, many of whom suffered trying to catch up to Ruud. With a high score in the second round, however, he was essentially unbeatable and skied his third run with the Norwegian flag as a victory lap. Nearly every other skier had good runs and bad ones but, when the snow settled and the points were added up, silver and bronze went to Colby Stevenson of the United States and Henrik Harlaut of Sweden respectively. Stevenson was the 2021 World runner-up in slopestyle, while Harlaut had made his name at the Winter X Games, while also being big air World runner-up in 2019. An additional merit of note came from Leonardo Donaggio, who finished in fifth, the best-ever Olympic finish for an Italian freestyle skier.

In fact there were two favorites for the gold medal, Maiya Maneza of Kazakhstan, 2009 and 2010 World Champion, 2011 runner-up, and 2010 Asian Games Champion, and Svetlana Tsarukayeva of Russia, 2011 World Champion and runner-up in 2006 (in the lightweight division), 2007, and 2009. Each was also a world record holder, Maeza in the clean and jerk and Tsarukayeva in the snatch. The third podium spot was somewhat more open and, with only ten competitors, it was anyone’s medal to win. Strong challengers included Christine Girard of Canada, the most recent Commonwealth and Pan American Champion, and Sibel Şimşek of Turkey, four times European Champion (2004 in the light-heavyweight, 2009, 2010, 2012), twice runner-up (2007 and 2008), and silver medalist at the 2010 World Championships.
Tsarukayeva and Maneza dominated the snatch portion of the event, with lifts of 112 kg and 110 kg respectively; next in line was Şimşek, who only managed 105 kg. The Russian fell behind in the clean and jerk, however, lifting 125 kg in her first attempt and then failing to lift 130 kg in two subsequent ones. She remained in first place while Şimşek and Girard each lifted 130 kg and the Turk, with a 2 kg advantage from the snatch, slid into the silver medal position. Not to be outdone, the Canadian lifted 133 kg in her next attempt to move into second place, a feat that Şimşek was unable to replicate. Milka Maneva of Bulgaria, bronze medalist at the 2008 European Championships, then attempted to knock Şimşek off the podium entirely by lifting 134 kg, which would have tied her with Girard for points and placed her in second by virtue of her lower body weight, but she failed and remained in fourth. Maneza was more successful, lifting 135 kg on her first attempt to surpass Tsarukayeva by eight points, tie the Olympic record for the clean and jerk, set a new one for total score, and win the gold medal. Already guaranteed bronze, Girard then attempted to lift the same weight to pass the Russian as well, but failed. Guaranteed to be an Olympic Champion, with her final two attempts Maneza tried to lift 144 kg, which would have broken the world record for the clean and jerk, but was unsuccessful.
That was how the event and the results seemed to have ended. In 2015, however, the IOC began re-testing samples from the 2008 Beijing and 2012 London Olympics, using newer, more advanced testing techniques, in an effort to find those who had used performance enhancing drugs (PEDs), but in whom it could not be detected at the time of those Olympics. This was one of the many events affected. Every women’s weightlifting event at the 2012 London Olympics, except flyweight (≤ 48 kg), was affected by positive re-tests.
The original results in this event were decimated. Testing positive were gold medalist Maiya Maneza (KAZ) (stanozolol); silver medalist Svetlana Tsarukayeva (RUS) (turinabol (dehydrochloromethyltestosterone)); and fourth-place finisher Sibel Şimşek (TUR) (turinabol (dehydrochloromethyltestosterone and stanozolol)). The medals were re-assigned as follows: Gold – Christine Girard (CAN); Silver – Milka Maneva (BUL); Bronze – Luz Acosta (MEX).

In this category no bronze medal was awarded. The gold medal was earned by Swedish artist David Wallin for At the Seaside of Arild, a painting whose female figure in the center of the painting is reminiscent of Botticelli’s Venus. The silver medal was won by US artist Ruth Miller for Struggle, a painting showing a realistic representation of a battle between a black and a white freestyle wrestler, a remarkable thing for the era considering that racial discrimination was still legal in the United States.

Since Sydney they had won the 2001 World Championships, and the 2001 and 2003 All-England titles. They had lost the 2003 Worlds in the final to Korea’s Kim Dong-Mun and Na Gyeong-Min, who had won 14 straight World Cup finals in 2003-04, but they lost in the Athina quarters to the Danish pair of Rikke Olsen and Jonas Rasmussen. The semi-finals were highly unusual for Olympic badminton as only one Asian team made it there – Zhang and Gao. They were joined by Olsen/Rasmussen, Danes Mette Schjoldager and Jens Eriksen, and the British team of Gail Emms and Nathan Robertson. Both semis were won in straights, with Zhang/Gao facing Emms/Robertson in the final. The British couple seemed overmatched, losing the first game 15-1, but they came back to win the second game and extend the match. Emms and Robertson led the final game 11-8, but Zhang and Gao scored six consecutive points and won 15-12. Emms and Robertson would win the World Championships in 2006.

If anyone could threaten them, it would most likely be the most recent winner of the Diamond Sculls, Canadian Joe Wright, Jr., who had teamed up with Jack Guest, a strong rower who would go on to win the Diamond Sculls in 1930. These two nations posted the fastest times in the opening round, but the Canadians suffered a surprise defeat in the second round at the hands of Germany’s Horst Hoeck and Gerhard Voigt, after finishing with the second-slowest time of the heats. They were able to overcome France in the repêchage, however, and bested the Germans in a rematch in the quarterfinals. By this time the United States was the only team who remained undefeated and, in the semifinals, overcame the Austrian duo of Leo Losert and Viktor Flessl, who earned bronze by virtue of a tournament structure that left them with no one else to compete against. The Canadians essentially had a walkover and faced the Americans in the final, but lost by nearly 10 seconds. Costello thus became the first Olympic rower to win three consecutive gold medals in the same event.

At the 1922 World Championships, Sweden’s Fritiof Svensson had won, with Estonian Eduard Pütsep second. But Svensson moved up in weight and competed in Paris as a featherweight, leaving the favorite role to Pütsep. He did not disappoint, winning all his matches to take the gold medal, with his victory in round four over Finland’s Anselm Ahlfors being decisive. Ahlfors took silver with the bronze going to his countryman, Väinö Ikonen, who had been the 1921 World Champion in this class. Pütsep would later win a silver medal at the 1927 European Championships, and compete at the 1928 Olympics, but with no medals. Ahlfors never competed at a World or European Championship but won the 1925 Nordic Championships in this event.

Wu, however, had not won a major title since, having left the 2018 and 2019 world title to Korea’s Hwang Dae-Heon. Defending World Champion Shaoang Liu was also considered, although he had won that title without any Asian opponents due to travel restrictions. His brother, Shaolin Sándor Liu, had won two of the 2021/22 World Cup races and led the standings, with Wu and Hwang also picking up wins.
Shaolin Sándor Liu was the only one of this group not to make the quarter-finals, failing in his last corner attempt to reach the top two. In the first semi-final, ROC’s Konstantin Ivliyev took full advantage of the inner starting position, leading start to finish. Behind him, Pietro Sighel qualified by 0.001, edging out Sitnikov after a great takeover maneuver earlier in the race. Liu, Hwang and Wu all met up in the second semi-final, but only the Hungarian would proceed. Liu won the race clearly, having overtaken early leader Steven Dubois. Hwang made a dual pass move in the final lap, passing Wu and Dubois, but taking out the latter in the attempt. This left the Korean with a penalty, and the Canadian advanced into the final. Wu meanwhile was pipped at the line by the surprising Abzal Azhgaliyev and had to comfort himself in the B final.
The final was fairly straightforward. Liu, having the inner lane advantage, got away with the lead, closely followed by fast-starter Ivliyev. The two opened up a sizeable gap. The others never quite managed to close it, leaving Liu to win his second Olympic gold after the relay title in 2018, ahead of Ivliyev and Dubois. Azhgaliyev placed fourth, while Sighel fell in the final lap.

They won heat one easily and their task seemed easier when the US team botched the second exchange between Allyson Felix and English Gardner. The veteran Felix made Gardner retrieve the baton and finish the race, but the US finished sixth and seemingly out of the final. The US protested, howeer, that the adjacent Brazilian runner had moved out of her lane and interfered with the Americans and the protest was upheld. The US team was allowed to run a time trial later that evening and attempt to qualify on time, requiring them to use the same lane and the same team, and the US ran 41.77 to move into the final.
The unusual circumstances forced the US out of the prime inner lanes and they had to run in lane one. Tianna Bartoletta put the Americans in the lead on the opening leg and Felix held off Thompson on the backstretch, giving Gardner a tenuous lead. Gardner pulled the US ahead with a scorching turn run, allowing 100 metre silver medallist Tori Bowie to win easily, as she pulled away from 100 bronze medallist, and 2008-12 100 gold medallist, Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce. The US foursome ran 41.01, the second fastest time ever.

The only other returning Olympic medalist was runner-up Hans Wetterström, who was also accompanied by a new partner, Carl-Gunnar Sundin. Wetterström and Sundin were also half of the silver medal-winning K-4 10000 crew at the 1954 World Championships. The reigning World Champions were Herbert Wiedermann and Max Raub of Austria, but they attempted to improve their results in the K-2 1000 from 1952, in which they had won bronze, and thus their nation was represented by Alfred Schmidtberger and Hermann Salzner. Reigning World bronze medalist Germany sent Fritz Briel and Theo Kleine. Much of the race was a battle between a leading group of four crews, Sweden, Germany, Hungary’s János Urányi and László Fábián, and Australia’s Dennis Green and Walter Brown but, as the finish line approached, the Swedes dropped back while Germany and Hungary went neck and neck towards the end. The Hungarians managed a slight advantage and won gold, leaving silver for the Germans and a surprise bronze medal for the Australians.

Randori means “chaos taking” or “grasping freedom,” and is contrasted to the more structured practice of kata. Aikido was developed by Morihei Ueshiba to synthesize martial arts, philosophy, and religious beliefs. Aikido may be translated as “the Way of unifying (with) life energy” or as “the Way of harmonious spirit.” Sixteen (16) different shiai events were demonstrated at Tokyo in 1964 as part of the kendo demonstrations. This event consisted of two women demonstrating shiai. There were two such demonstrations given.

He seemed well on his way to the gold medal, reaching the final round with only 1.0 bad points, where he was joined by Italy’s Claudio Pollio, and North Korean Jang Se-Hong. Pollio had already defeated Jang in round four, but he lost the first match of the final to Kornilayev. Then in the final match of the event Jang stunningly threw Kornilayev in 7:23, which gave the gold medal to Pollio in a major upset.

Oh Sang-Uk was beaten by Bazadze 15-13 in the quarter-finals.
Szilágyi had won the two previous Olympics and became the first fencer to win the Olympic men’s sabre title three times. This brought back memories of Hungary’s glory days in sabre when a Hungarian was the champion in nine consecutive Olympics (1924-1964). Since then, however, Hungary won the title only once (in 1992) until Szilágyi won in 2012.

Romania and Poland were drawn together in the first opening heat, which the former won, although both advanced directly to the final. The other heat, meanwhile, was taken by Germany’s Christian Gille and Tomasz Wylenzek, who had never reached the podium in this event at a major international tournament. They would go on, however, to win the gold medal in the final by a margin of over a second.

Wise had been somewhat uneven since Sochi, but had recently won the superpipe at the 2018 Winter X Games and was seen as being at the top of his game going into the PyeongChang Olympics. The silver and bronze medalists from 2014, Mike Riddle of Canada and Kévin Rolland of France respectively, were also present in Sochi, and had repeated their podium finishes at the most recent edition of the World Championships, where American Aaron Blunck had taken gold.
The United States, led by Blunck, took the top three spots in the qualifying round, but Wise was not among them, finishing far down in the pack at eighth, behind Riddle and Roland. In second was Alex Ferreira, runner-up at both the 2016 and 2018 Winter X Games superpipe, while Torin Yater-Wallace, the most recent Winter X bronze medalist, was a bit behind in third. Nonetheless, all of the favorites advanced to the final and there were few surprises overall.
The same could not be said, however, about the final itself. Rolland had it the worst, and failed to complete any of his runs, suffering a terrible-looking crash in his final attempt. Yater-Wallace had an unimpressive first run, and was unable to complete the final two, also landing hard on his third. Ferreira, on the other hand, had an excellent final round, not only being one of just two competitors to complete all three runs successfully, but also scoring over 90 points in each and improving on his total each time. With a final score of 96.40, it looked as if Ferreira had clinched the title, but an outstanding third run from Wise, who had crashed on his previous two attempts, saw him surpass his compatriot with an outstanding performance and land in the gold medal position. Thus Ferreira had to settle for silver, while 16 year-old Nico Porteous of New Zealand took bronze on the strength of his impressive second run.

Since the 1996 Olympics, the four world titles had been won by four different cyclists, with the 2000 title going to France’s Miguel Martinez. The 1996 silver medalist, Thomas Frischknecht (SUI), tried to steal the race early and led after the first four laps but he was then passed by Martinez and Belgium’s Filip Meirhaeghe. Martinez quickly broke Meirhaeghe and won the gold medal by over a minute.
Martinez had not only won the 2000 World title, but also the World Cup, hence dominating the season. His father was Mariano Martinez, who won two stages (1978, 1980) and the polka dot jersey (1978) in the Tour de France. In July 2004, Meirhaeghe was caught using EPO, and was suspended for two years.  He admitted to doping, but was able to make a comeback and compete at the 2008 Olympics. Frischknecht was a veteran, having been runner up at the Worlds in 1990-92. He again finished second in 1996, but moved into first when the winner was later disqualified for doping.  He was also a former World Championship runner-up in cyclo-cross, as his father had been.
In 22nd place was Michael Rasmussen (DEN), the 1999 World Champion. Rasmussen would soon turn to road racing, and won the polka dot jersey as King of the Mountains at the 2005-2006 Tour de France. In 2005, he was in third place in GC entering the penultimate stage, an individual time trial. But obviously not a time trialist, he fell several times, endured several bike changes, placed 77th in the stage, and dropped to seventh overall. In 2007, Rasmussen again put on the polka dot jersey, and actually held the yellow jersey as leader of the Tour after 16 stages and seemed assured of victory. But he was then withdrawn by his Rabobank team when he was found to have evaded doping controls several times, by frequently failing to report his location. A future two-time runner-up in the Tour de France also in this race was Australian Cadel Evans, who placed seventh, but later turned to road racing.

Perhaps this was due to the German origin of the sport, yet the international federation had been re-established after the war as the International Handball Federation, and it was recognized by the IOC.
In 1952, field handball was again played at the Olympics, but this time as a demonstration event. It had been picked by the Finnish organizers as a sport not played in the country (the other demonstration event was in pesapällo, Finnish baseball). They had originally wanted to demonstrate rugby, but this turned out to be impossible. For the handball match, the finalists of the 1948 world championships, Sweden and Denmark, were invited. Sweden had also finished second at the 1952 championships, which were held briefly before the Olympics. In rainy conditions, in front of a poorly filled Olympic Stadium, the Swedes defeated the Danes, 19-11. The demonstration did not help to bring back handball as an Olympic sport soon; it would only return 20 years later at the Munich Olympics.

He and West German Bernd Gröne got away once more briefly afterwards, and Ludwig won the sprint-out easily. With the fall of Berlin Wall in 1990, he became one the first East German riders to ride professionally.  His sprinting abilities allowed him to win many races, and in 1990 he won the green jersey as the Points Leader at the Tour de France. His greatest classics victory was the 1992 Amstel Gold Race.

Also in contention was Sylvain André of France, who had won a full compliment of medals at the Worlds, with gold in 2018, silver in 2017, and bronze in 2019. Colombian Carlos Ramírez, the 2016 Olympic bronze medallist, was also back in Tokyo.
There were no surprises in the quarterfinals, as André, Kimmann, Fields, and France’s Joris Daudet won their heats. Kimmann’s success was impressive, considering that he had fractured his kneecap in an accident shortly before the race, while Daudet was another race favorite and had been world champion in 2011 and 2016.
There was more shock in the semifinals, when van Gendt performed poorly and finished last overall in his heat, while Fields crashed in his third run and was hospitalized, albeit still technically qualifying for the final on the basis of his first two runs. Ramírez and André came second and third in that heat respectively, but the winner was Romain Mahieu of France, a relatively unheralded rider. The other semifinal heat was won by Kimmann, who went on to win the gold medal by edging out Great Britain’s Kye Whyte, who took home silver. Daudet looked to be the bronze medallist, but he fell shortly before the end of the race, allowing Ramírez to claim his second bronze medal.

He had won the distance at the 1959 European Championships, and was second at the 1959 World Championships. At the recent 1960 World and European Championships, the distance had been won by Boris Stenin and Knut Johannesen, respectively, although Johannesen was normally considered better at the longer distances.
The day of the race was clear but with very high winds, as in the 5,000 the day before, which hampered the skaters and slowed down the times a bit. A large field of 48 skaters answered the gun. Among the favorites, Stenin was off first, in the sixth pair. He started well and was the first skater to pass 700 metres in under a minute, and finished in 2:11.5 to take the lead. The time held up until the ninth pair when Norway’s Roald Aas finished in 2:10.4. Aas was well off Stenin’s pace even thru 1,100 metres, but finished very strongly. Aas skated alongside Järvinen, who was behind Aas throughout and could not match his final lap, finishing in 2:13.1, which would place him tied for fifth. Grishin started in the 13th pair, and set the fastest pace. His splits were 26 seconds, 58 seconds, and 1:32, all the fastest of the event, but he could not match Aas’s finish, and he crossed the line in 2:10.4. The times would hold up with Grishin and Aas tieing for first, with Stenin third. Amazingly, the event had co-champions as it had in 1956.
Aas was not new to the podium at the Olympics as he had been the bronze medalist in this event in 1952 at Oslo. He had had a solid international career since 1951, finishing third in all-around at the 1957 and 1960 European Championships and the 1958 World Championships. He retired after this, his greatest triumph. Grishin had been competing internationally since 1954. Among the greatest sprinters ever, he was almost never beaten at 500 metres, and in the 1,500, had won the distance at the 1955 and 1957 Europeans, in addition to his two Olympic golds. He continued to race after Squaw Valley, though less frequently after 1963, but would appear at the 1964 and 1968 Winter Olympics, winning a silver in the 500 in 1964.

Separate competition.,na,"The United States was favored, and had the hottest show jumper of the last few years in Melanie Smith, the 1982 World Cup Champion, and Joe Fargis, the individual gold medalist. They were so strong that the 1983 World Champion, Norman Dello Joio, was not even selected for the team. Other favorites included France, which had won the 1982 World Championships, and the always strong West Germany and Great Britain teams.
The US led in the first round with only 4.00 faults, as Smith went clean, as did Fargis. Unfortunately, Smith’s horse, Calypso, was injured at the end of his ride and could not start the second round, which gave the US only three riders, so they could not afford a bad effort. They did fine. Fargis had another clean ride, for a perfect score, and Conrad Homfeld also went clean. Leslie Burr had 8.00 faults in round two, giving the US the best score in the second round to win the gold medal by the largest margin in a “real” Olympic competition since 1956 (discounting the 1980 junior varsity events).
Great Britain came in as a strong medal contender and proved their worth by winning the silver medal. They were tied for third in round one, trailing West Germany, and equal with Canada, but Britain had the second best score of round two, with only 12.75 faults, and moved just ahead of West Germany, which won the bronze medal narrowly over the Canadian team.

Davis took the lead from the start, lifting 137.5 kg in the press to lead by 10.0 kg over Dutchman Bram Charité. Davis also lifted 137.5 kg in the snatch to lead that phase, taking a 20.0 kg lead over his teammate, Norb Schemansky. Davis again had the best mark in the clean & jerk, 177.5 kg, to win the gold over Schemansky by 27.5 kg, with Charité taking bronze.
Davis would return in 1952 and repeated as gold medalist. He would remain undefeated from 1938-52, before placing second to Canada’s Doug Hepburn at the 1953 World Championships, after which Davis retired. Schemansky competed at three more Olympics, winning a gold medal in 1952 in the new middle-heavyweight class, and returning to the heavyweight division in 1960 and 1964, winning bronze medals both times. He was the first Olympic lifter to win four medals, something that has been repeated only three other times through 2012, and not done again until 2000.

She had won all three World Cup races in which she participated. In addition, she had broken the world record in the sprint combination at test races in Davos in January, skating well below 40 seconds on both 500 metres. But competition was to be expected from China’s Ye Qiaobo, the runner-up at the 1991 World Sprint Championships and winner of a World Cup race in Albertville, and the Netherlands’ Christine Aaftink, who had twice been runner-up at World Cups. The German women were also not to be forgotten, notably Christa Luding (the 1988 Olympic 1,000 m champion), Angela Hauck, and Monique Garbrecht, World Sprint Champions of 1990 and 1991, respectively.
Skating in the first pair, Aaftink’s medal chances were slashed after a poor final curve and 40.66. That time was promptly beaten by Ye with 40.51. She might have done better, as she appeared to be obstructed by pairmate Yelena Tyushnyakova, but no re-skate was allowed. Despite better openers than the Chinese, both Luding and Garbrecht failed to beat Ye’s final time, clocking 40.57 and 40.63. The fifth pair then saw Blair pull away from Hauck, beating her easily and winning the race in 40.33. For Blair, it was her second gold medal in a career that would eventually earn her five Olympic titles. Ye’s silver medal was notable as it was China’s first ever Olympic medal at the Winter Olympics. Four years earlier, she had missed the Olympics due to a doping offense at the World Sprint Championships. In Albertville she declared this was due to drugs given to her by the team doctor, whom she had trusted.

Finland was considered to be the leading nation in the absence of the Soviet Union, as they had already organized national championships for several years. Their best female skier, Tyyne Wideman, national champion in 1949, 1950 and 1951, decided to end her career after the 1951 season. Her twin sister Lydia Wideman, Finnish champion 1952 and newly engaged, had to be strongly persuaded to travel to the Oslo games.
Halfway 31-year-old Lydia Wideman, starting early as number six, had built up a solid lead, a minute ahead of her teammate, Mirja Hietamies, who was 10-years younger. The Swedish medal hope Märta Nordberg shared third place with Sirkka Polkunen, 10 seconds behind Hietamis, and the fourth Finn, Siiri Rantanen, was another five seconds behind in fifth position. The rest of the field was well behind those five. Wideman held on to her lead at the finish, and in a close battle for silver and bronze, Hietamis was able to hold off the fast finishing Rantanen behind her. Nordberg was not able to fulfill her hopes of a medal, beaten by Rantanen by only three seconds at the finish. The 10 km. race in Oslo was Lydia Wideman’s last race in her skiing career.

Yet in 1935 Switzerland, represented by the Zurich Rowing Club, had won the Cup, which was only the second time since 1873 that Great Britain had been defeated in the tournament.

In the opening round Switzerland defeated Great Britain in their heat by over three seconds, but the fastest time went to the Germans, represented by Rudolf Eckstein, Martin Karl, Willi Menne, and Toni Rom of Würzburger RV Bayern, who had won the 1934 European Championships. With the two victors advancing directly to the finals, the semi-finals essentially served as a repêchage, with Austria, Denmark (who had won the 1933 European Championships with a different crew), Great Britain, and Italy qualifying. The Swiss rowers were hampered by exhaustion, its quartet having competed earlier in the coxed fours event (they were also members of the coxed eights crew), which led to the final evolving into a contest between Germany and Great Britain. The latter put out a strong effort, but the host nation won by a comfortable margin of nearly five seconds and took the gold medal.

But the competition really came down to Tian against his teammate, Hu Jia, who was little known outside China in 2000. Tian led after the semi-finals, which combined the score from the qualifying round, but Hu had a higher set of dives in the semis, which carried over to the final, and gave him a five-point lead. On the fourth dive of the final, Tian finally pulled ahead with his back 3½ pike, with a DD of 3.6, scoring 101.52, at the time the highest score for a dive in Olympic history. Tian then held on during the final two rounds to win the gold medal, with Hu taking second. Sautin won the bronze medal, one of four diving medals he won in Sydney. Hu and Tian would tangle again in Athens, with Hu winning the gold medal in 2004, and Tian placing third.

After defeating the Soviet Union’s Eduard Borisov in his first bout it was assumed that he had a clear run to the final but that reckoned without Nicolae Linca of Romania. With a close and unpopular, at least with the crowd, decision Linca upset Gargano in the semi-final. The other semi-final was contested between Fred Tiedt, an Irishman of Austrian extraction, and the home favourite Kevin Hogarth. Although he was comfortably out boxed by Tiedt, Hogarth did have the consolation of becoming the first Australian boxing medal winner since the 1908 Games. The final was the most controversial of the 1956 boxing tournament. Two judges gave the victory to Tiedt by comfortable margins but the three other had Linca narrowly in front. The Official Report of the Games considered Tiedt to be an “unlucky loser” and even decades later Irish sports fans still refer to it as a “robbery”. As of 2012, Linca is unique as the only Romanian to have won an Olympic title in boxing. His life ended tragically as he was stricken by Parkinson’s disease and later Alzheimer’s Disease.

1973,"30 kilometres, Men",1976 Winter Olympics,40,Cross Country Skiing,/editions/40/sports/CCS, 5 February 1976 — 9:00,"Langlaufstadion, Seefeld",69 from 21 countries,na,Course Length: ?Height Differential: 174 mIntermediate 1: 10.0 kmIntermediate 2: 20.0 kmMaximum Climb: 55 mTotal Climbing: 825 m,"Since the 1972 Games an equipment revolution had taken place in cross-country skiing. During the 1973-74 season the old wooden skis had been replaced by the new fiberglass ski. Also, a new generation of skiers had taken over, and the Soviet Union had emerged as the leading cross-country nation, not only among the women but also in the men’s events. Also other East European countries had developed top cross-country skiers, notably East Germany, Poland and Czechoslovakia had won medals at the 1974 World Championships.
As usual, the 30 km race for men was the opening cross-country event. At 10 km, Norwegian Ivar Formo was in the lead, two seconds ahead of the 22-year old Soviet newcomer, Nikolay Bazhukov. At the next intermediate time, 20 km, the Soviet skiers had taken over the race. Bazhukov was in the lead, eight seconds ahead of his teammate Sergey Savelyev, with Ivan Garanin, another Soviet skier, in third place, 17 seconds behind the leader. The biggest surprise come from a young American, 20-year old Bill Koch, who had moved up to fourth place, two seconds ahead of Formo, who had dropped from first to fifth. Juha Mieto, the big Finn who had won silver at the distance at the 1974 World Championships, was also advancing in the field, moving up to sixth place. Mieto, wearing start #2, was the first of the favorites to reach the finish, skiing strongly over the last 10 km. Koch, the surprising American, was next. He had had a nine second lead over Mieto after 20 km, and he took over the first position, bettering Mieto’s time by 22 seconds. When Garanin, next of the top contenders to finish, was not able to better Koch’s time, the chances for a sensational cross-country medal for the USA began to seem possible. But Savelyev, lying second after 20 km, had the strongest finish of all and took over the lead, 28 seconds ahead of Koch. None of the late starting favorites could match the finishing times of Savelyev and Koch. Formo faded badly and ended in 11th place. Bazhyukov, the leader at 20 km, could not keep the pace over the last 10 km and finished behind Mieto in fifth place.
The new Olympic Champion Savelyev was relatively unmerited on the international circuit, his best placing was fifth at the 1975 Holmenkollen over 50 km. He was born in the Amur region in the Far East, and started serious training at the age of 19 when he was a soldier in the Moscow region. He explained that was because it was too cold to train for skiing in the winter in his childhood village, when temperatures could reach -50 degrees Celsius. Bill Koch, the surprising silver medalist, had shown a great talent as a junior, but nobody had expected him to win the first medal for an American in top-level cross-country competition.

The five-time Olympic champion and winner of 11 Olympic medals had planned to retire after her fifth Olympics but was hoping to go out with another gold medal in her top event. Having won 26 World Cups, five world titles and two Olympic golds in the 1,500 m, defending champion Wüst was undeniably one of favorites. Her main challenger was considered to be Japan’s Miho Takagi, the 2018 silver medalist who had won all three 1,500 m World Cups in the 2021/22 season she contested. The fourth World Cup was won by Brittany Bowe, also the 2015 world champion, while surprise 2021 champion Ragne Wiklund was considered an outsider for the gold.
ROC’s Yevgeniya Lalenkova, world bronze medalist in 2021, produced the first 1:55 time of the day, with 1:55.74, which was soon improved by Marijke Groenewoud, a surprise qualifier for the Dutch team. In pair 11, that time was narrowly beaten by Antoinette de Jong with 1:54.82. De Jong had beaten Wüst to the European title in January, but Wüst wasn’t going to have that happen in Beijing. After opening in 25.51 (same as De Jong), she managed to keep her speed throughout the end, gradually building up a lead of 1.5 seconds and beating the Olympic Record with 1:53.28. That left three Dutch skaters in the lead with three pairs to go.
World Cup leader Ayano Sato matched the splits of De Jong, but crossed the finish line a tenth of a second later, just ahead of Groenwoud. In pair 14, Bowe and Wiklund both disappointed, with Bowe’s laptimes blowing up after a fast start, and Wiklund just never picking up sufficient speed. That left only Takagi and Yelizaveta Golubeva. The Japanese favorite had the fastest opening of the day but lost to Wüst in both subsequent laps. At the bell, she trailed the Dutchwoman by only 0.03, but her final lap was slightly worse, reaching 1:53.72 at the finish line.
Wüst’s sixth speed skating gold matched the record of Soviet Russian Lidiya Skoblikova, and improved her total number of speed skating medals to 12 (she would win a 13th in the team pursuit), confirming her status as both the most successful Olympic speed skater as well as that of most successful Dutch Olympian (regardless of season).

FIFA had proposed to open the tournament only for players aged 23 and under, regardless of whether they were professionals or not. This did not sit well with several Eastern European countries, who had dominated the previous tournaments with their state sponsored amateurs. They correctly claimed that the FIFA proposal would violate two principles of the IOC, regarding professionalism and age restrictions. The IOC initially voted against the proposal, but a compromise was eventually reached that excluded only so-called “full professionals,” defined as those who had played at least one full match in the FIFA World Cup, but only for nations from Europe and South America.
Following the Soviet-led boycott, all three medallists from the 1980 Games withdrew. Of the three 1984 medallists, only Yugoslavia had won an Olympic football medal before, although France and Brazil could hardly be called newcomers to the sport - the French national squad had won Euro ‘84 earlier that year. Brazil’s appearance in the final marked the first South American team in the closing rounds of the tournament since Uruguay and Argentina in 1928. Playing with future World Cup winner Dunga, Brazil was unable to topple the French team. They were coached by Henri Michel, who would go on to coach France at the 1986 World Cup. He also coached three African teams at World Cups: Cameroon, Morocco and Cote d’Ivoire. A novelty at the 1984 Olympics was the use of penalty kicks to decide drawn matches in the knock-out phase. It was first used in the quarter-final between Brazil and Canada.

In addition to veteran Olympian Ted Nash, they also sent Geoffrey Picard, Dick Lyon, Ted Mittet, and Philip Durbrow. Germany, meanwhile, had won the last two European Championships and the inaugural World Championships, and sent their reigning European champions, Günter Schrörs, 1960 Olympic champion in the coxed fours Horst Effertz, Albrecht Müller, and Manfred Misselhorn to Tokyo. England had been the victors at the most recent British Empire and Commonwealth Games and, although Great Britain sent a different squad to the 1964 Summer Games, they were considered a medal contender in the coxless fours.
Germany had the most impressive run in the opening round, while Great Britain and Denmark won the other heats. Denmark was represented by the most recent European silver medalists: John Ørsted Hansen, Erik Petersen, Kurt Helmudt, and Bjørn Borgen Hasløv. The Americans advanced to the finals through the repêchage, but did not look strong compared to the other heat winners, Italy and the Netherlands. Three of Italy’s rowers, Romano Sgheiz, Fulvio Balatti, and Giovanni Zucchi, were bronze medalists from the 1960 Olympic coxed fours event (and Sgheiz was a champion from the same event in 1956) and, with Luciano Sgheiz, had won silver and bronze at the 1963 and 1964 European Championships respectively. The race for podium spots was close and exciting: just over two seconds separated the surprise gold medalists, Denmark, from the bronze medal-winning Americans, with the Britons sandwiched in-between with silver. This was the former rowing power of Great Britain’s first Olympic medal since 1948, as well as Denmark’s first gold medal since then.

Ryun had run at the 1964 Olympics while only a high schooler, but since the Tokyo Olympics, he had broken the mile world record, running 3:51.3 on 17 July 1966 at Berkeley, California. Then at the 1967 AAU Meet, he bettered that with 3:51.1. In July 1967 a dual meet between the USA and the British Commonwealth was planned in Los Angeles. Running for the Commonwealth team was Kenya’s Kip Keino, who was felt to be the best miler in the world, after Ryun. At that event, Ryun and Keino raced over 1,500 metres and Ryun shattered the field and world record with 3:33.1, Keino over four seconds behind. Ryun was felt to be unstoppable.
But the Olympics were in 1968, not 1966 or 1967, and they were held at the altitude of Mexico City. Further, early in 1968, Ryun fell ill with a mild case of mononucleosis which affected his training. He trained in Flagstaff, Arizona to try to acclimatize to altitude but his weakness from the mono made that difficult. Still he made the US Olympic team, and he had been so dominant in 1966-67 that he was considered a slight favorite for the 1,500. Ryun and Keino both passed thru to the final, but another important runner was also there, Keino’s Kenyan teammate, Ben Jipcho. Not considered a medal contender, Jipcho and Keino planned a strategic race trying to weaken Ryun’s deadly kick. Jipcho passed 400 metres in a suicidal 56.0 with Keino on his shoulder in 56.6. Ryun ran in third but was well back and the pace was felt to be far too fast for the 2,200 metre altitude. But Keino pushed on, taking the lead at 800 in 1:55.3. Ryun was 30 metres back. Keino ran his third lap in 58.1, passing 1,200 in 2:53.4, faster than world record pace. Nobody could keep up that pace, it was felt, but Ryun and the field were now so far behind that the race was over. Keino held on to win in an Olympic record 3:34.91, considered unreachable in that thin air. Ryun did win the silver medal, 25 metres back.

Great Britain qualified in fourth place, thanks largely to the bravery of Elissa Downie. She suffered a bad fall during her floor exercise routine and landed awkwardly on her neck. She tried to finish her routine but couldn’t and was led away for medical treatment, but ten minutes later returned to perform in the vault and help Great Britain qualify for the team event, also getting herself into the final of the all-round individual event.
The USA were head and shoulders above the other seven teams and, in addition to having the “The World’s Greatest Gymnast”, Simone Biles, on their team, they had Aly Raisman and Gabby Douglas, the first girls to make consecutive appearances on the US gymnastics team since Amy Chow and Dominique Dawes at Atlanta 1996 and Sydney 2000. Being the oldest member of the US team at 22, Raisman was known as “Grandma” by her teammates.
As the defending Olympic champions, and with back-to-back world titles to their name in 2014-15, the experience of the USA team clearly showed as they won gold by a massive 8.209 points ahead of Russia with China close behind in third. It was the biggest margin of victory at any international tournament since the current marking system was introduced in 2006. The USA ranked number one overall in every discipline and their star, Biles, was ranked one in the vault, beam and floor. Madison Kocian ranked equal one on the uneven bars. The American team called themselves the “Final Five” in honour of their legendary coach Martha Karolyi who was retiring after Rio. China had the silver medal in their hands until the final rotation, when they had a poor floor exercise and scored just 42.066, while Russia posted 45.733 in the vault to snatch the silver by just 0.685 of a point.

They could actually have skipped the final two races and won the gold medal by almost 500 points, but they raced, although they were disqualified in the sixth race, and placed only sixth in the seventh outing. The second-placed team, the Cuban crew of Carlos de Cárdenas Culmell and Carlos de Cárdenas Plá, were also a father and son. They were only in fifth place after six races, but finished second in the final race to move up to silver. The fifth-place Italian boat, Legionario, was helmed by Agostino Straulino, who won eight consecutive European Championships in the Sar from 1949-56, and returned in 1952 to win Olympic gold and in 1956 to add an Olympic silver.

The nation was represented by Vladimir Romanovsky and Serhiy Nahorniy in Montreal. Poland’s Ryszard Oborski and Grzegorz Śledziewski, meanwhile, had won the 1974 World Championships, while Hungary’s József Deme and János Rátkai had been runners-up at the 1973 and 1974 Worlds, as well as in the K-2 1000 at the 1972 Summer Olympics. Romania, the 1973 World bronze medalist, repeated that feat in 1975 with Larion Serghei and Policarp Malîhin and sent them to compete at the 1976 Games. The only other nation to win World medals was East Germany (bronze in 1974, silver in 1975), who was represented by Bernd Olbricht and Joachim Mattern in Montreal.
The opening heats were won by Romania, the Belgian duo of Jean-Pierre Burny and Paul Hoekstra, and the East Germans, the latter of whom posted the round’s fastest time. Hoekstra had competed for the Netherlands through 1970, and had won a silver medal in the Olympic K-2 1000 in 1964, but began representing Belgium in 1971 and, with Burny, was runner-up in the K-2 500 at that year’s World Championships. Hungary and Poland, meanwhile, survived only through the repêchage. The Spanish duo of José Seguín and Guillermo del Riego surprised in the semi-final round by finishing in the fastest time, albeit only 0.01 seconds faster than the Soviets, while the East Germans won the third heat and helped eliminate Poland. The medal round was close, but not overly so, with East Germany, the Soviet Union, and Romania finishing in that order with at least a little breathing room. East Germany and the Soviet Union also won medals in the K-2 1000, but the results were flipped, with the former emerging victorious and the latter completing the course as runners-up.

Trenary was tops in the school figures and with those eliminated from the competition, that hurt her chances. Then in mid-1991 she badly injured an ankle. Knowing she could not recover for Albertville, she retired from international competition in December 1991. This brought the event down to Ito vs. Yamaguchi. Yamaguchi won the short program, followed by her teammate, Nancy Kerrigan, with France’s Surya Bonaly third. Ito placed fourth, which meant that to win the gold medal she had to win the free skate, and hope that all three leaders skated poorly. That did not happen. After the first six skaters in the free program fell, Yamaguchi skated cleanly, although it was a conservative effort, but it brought her the gold medal. Ito was second in the free, and moved up to the silver medal, the first figure skating medal won by a skater from other than Europe or North America, with Kerrigan winning bronze, followed by another American, Tonya Harding. Kerrigan and Harding would make much more noise in 1994. Bonaly placed only sixth in the free and dropped to fifth place overall.
Yamaguchi turned professional after the 1992 Winter Olympics. In Albertville, however, she also met her future husband, Bret Hedican, who skated on the USA ice hockey team, and later played for many years in the NHL with the Carolina Hurricanes. Yamaguchi had started as a pairs skater, early in her career with Rudy Galindo, and competed at the World Championships in 1990 in both events, rare in this era. She dropped pairs in late 1990 to concentrate on singles.

At the Games they won the opening round with ease and then captured gold comfortably ahead of their nearest competitor, Great Britain. The British women’s silver was somewhat of a surprise, as they had never medaled in this event at the Olympics or the World Championships, but they managed to edge out Russia, the 1998 and 1999 World runner-up and bronze medalist respectively, by the slimmest of margins: 0.01 seconds.

The nation had not performed as well at the World Championships, however, and the last two World Champions, Switzerland and West Germany, were present in Los Angeles. In fact, it was the absence of the traditionally strong Soviet Union crew (the 1980 Olympic runners-up, as well as the 1981 World Champions and 1982 and 1983 runners-up) that probably had more of an impact in leaving the podium open. Great Britain, the 1980 bronze medalists, had a slight advantage, due to its representatives’ recent success in the Stewards’ Challenge Cup at the Henley Royal Regatta, but even this was mitigated by the presence of the Swiss, whose delegation had won the event twice prior to the most recent edition.
As if to highlight how open the absence of the Eastern Bloc had left this event, the round one heats were won by New Zealand and the United States, neither of whom had ever won a World Championship medal in this event (although the United States were the reigning Pan American runners-up). Great Britain, meanwhile, came last in its heat during the repêchage and was eliminated. In the final, New Zealand garnered a sizeable lead and, by the end, was mostly unchallenged as it drove towards the finish line to win gold.

Despite this dominance, the Netherlands only once captured Olympic gold, in 2014. For Beijing, the Dutch were once again favored, but with ageing great Sven Kramer and Marcel Bosker they had two riders without any great individual performances at the Olympics. In addition, other nations had pioneered team pursuit tactics, including pushing the skater in front of you (allowing for better aerodynamics and transfer of speed) as well as choosing not to switch the leading skater. In recent World Cups, the United States had been particularly successful with these tactics, winning twice and bettering the world record. Defending champions Norway were also favored, although their top skater, Sverre Lunde Pedersen, had only barely recovered from a horrific cycling crash in the summer of 2021, which had left him with severe leg, neck and liver injuries.
Two of the favorites met in the quarter-finals. The Norwegians led the entire race, but only narrowly held off the US, which finished only 0.04 behind. With 3:37.47, Norway recorded the fastest qualifying time. The Dutch set the third time, while ROC took the final semi spot. That was slightly surprising, as they had only qualified for the Games by time (not performances).
As in 2018, Norway knocked out the Netherlands in the semi-finals, by a clear margin. The other semi-final was a much closer affair. ROC got off to a quick start, but the US were even again halfway. The ROC skaters then pulled away slightly towards an impressive 3:36.62, the best time ever recorded at sea level and an Olympic Record.
Despite setting the second fastest time of the tournament, this left the Americans to fight for bronze, which they easily claimed against the Netherlands. This left the Dutch medal-less for the first time in the event, while the Americans saw former inline speed skating great Joey Mantia finally claim his first Olympic medal at his third Games.
In the final, ROC seemed to have spent all their energy in the semi-finals. Trailing by 0.24 after half a lap already, they never came closer, making Norway the first repeat champions in the event, although Pedersen was the only skater to race on both victorious teams.

She came into London favored and proved the experts correct, winning the gold medal in a comfortable 9:06.72, almost two seconds ahead of the runner-up Habiba Ghribi of Tunisia. Zaripova led from the start and continued to string out the field with her excellent hurdling technique. After two kilometres, only Al-Ghribi, Sofia Assefa of Ethiopia and Milcah Chemos of Kenya could maintain contact with her. On the final lap, Al-Ghribi moved to Zaripova’s shoulder and seemed ready to pass her, but Zaripova picked up the pace and waltzed away to victory, not hampered by having led from the start. Zaripova said, “It was easy to win this gold. I was very confident about winning.” Assefa followed Al-Ghribi across the line for the bronze medal, with Chemos finishing fourth. Defending champion Gulnara Samitova-Galkina competed in the final but did not finish.
Al-Ghribi did not have an easy time competing as a Tunisian woman in athletics. Radicals in Tunisia claimed her behavior was un-Islamic and they urged the Tunisian government to strip her of her nationality because her running gear was too revealing.
That was how the event and the results seemed to have ended. In 2015, however, the IOC began re-testing samples from the 2008 Beijing and 2012 London Olympics, using newer, more advanced testing techniques, in an effort to find those who had used performance enhancing drugs (PEDs), but in whom it could not be detected at the time of those Olympics. This was one of the many events affected.
The gold medalist, Yuliya Zaripova, was found guilty of a biological passport offense in March 2016 and was disqualified. Tunisia’s Habiba Ghribi was advanced to the gold medal, while the silver went to the original bronze medalist, Sofia Assefa of Ethiopia, with original fourth-place finisher Milcah Chemos was awarded the bronze medal.
No other medalists were affected but between May and December 2015, three runners were also disqualified for biological passport offenses. These were Spaniard Marta Domínguez, who finished 12th in the final, Turkish runner Binnaz Uslu, and Ukrainian Svitlana Shmidt, both of whom did not advance out of the first round. Another runner, Gülcan Mıngır, who also did not make the final, was later disqualified for a retroactive doping positive announced in February 2020.

The Olympic record had been set by Charles Dvorak at St. Louis in 1904, with 11-6 (3.50).  Neither Dvorak nor Dray competed, although Dray had finished in a four-way tie for first at the 1908 IC4A Meet on 30 May.  Dray had tied with A. C. Gilbert, Frank Nelson, and Charles Campbell, and all four competed for Yale University’s track team.  Dray withdrew because his mother was concerned that he might be injured if he competed.  Gilbert had also won the Eastern Olympic Trial with Dray and Nelson tieing for second.  Among other nations, the top vaulters were Sweden’s Bruno Söderström, 1907 AAA champion and silver medalist in 1906, and Canada’s Ed Archibald, who had cleared 12-5 (3.80) in Canada earlier in the season and three weeks before the Games had won the British title at 12-0 (3.66).
Five competitors broke the Olympic record, and two more equalled the former record.  The Americans, Alfred “A. C.” Gilbert and Ed Cook shared first place at 12-2 (3.71) with Archibald and Söderström tieing with Charles Jacobs (USA) for third.  The closing stages of the competition were considerably delayed as they coincided with the dramatic happenings at the finish of the marathon.  Because of the time factor, the officials decided against holding jump-offs for first and third places and, in an unusual decision, two gold and three bronze medals were awarded.
For the last time in Olympic competition, the “climbing” technique was permitted although it remained legal in England until 1920.  Among their numerous protests, the Americans argued about the fact that there was no pit or hole in which to plant the pole and also that there was no sandpit or bales of straw to break the competitors falls.  This protest was understandable as the organizers were definitely behind the times in these matters as these facilities had been provided at the two previous Olympic Games.
Edward Cook was a fine all-around jumper and hurdler.  He won the IC4A long jump in 1908 and 1909, the AAU pole vault in 1907 and tied for first in the AAU pole vault in 1911.  Gilbert spread his athletic talents even farther, winning the 1905 Yale gymnastics championship and was intercollegiate wrestling champion in 1906.  Gilbert earned an M.D. degree from Yale but never practiced medicine.  He later made a fortune as president of the toy company that bore his name and manufactured Erector Sets, American Flyer electric trains, and other popular toys.

Also of note were the Canadians, led by veteran Brad Gushue, who was making a return to the Olympic Games sixteen years after winning a gold medal in 2006 as a member of the team skipped by Russ Howard.
In the round-robin, Sweden and Great Britain established themselves as the teams to beat once the medal round commenced, going 8-1 and 7-2 respectively. One could pretty well throw a blanket over the rest of the field, though, as the next seven teams ended up within two games of each other in the standings. Ultimately, the United States and Canada advanced, despite the latter losing their last two round-robin games. Canada did provide a real test for Sweden in the semi-finals. It was a closely contested match, and Brad Gushue narrowly missed a run back double in the 10th end with the last rock, which would have propelled Canada into the gold medal game. As it was, Sweden prevailed and awaited the winner of the other semi-final featuring the United States and Great Britain. Although that game ended in an 8-4 win for Great Britain, the score was not indicative of the play, as only a point separated them at the midway break with steals in the 9th and 10th ends providing the margin of victory for the British.
In the bronze medal game, after falling behind by a pair in the first end, the United States battled back to take a one point lead after scoring a deuce in the sixth end. Canada then resumed control of the game with two points in the eighth and a steal of two in ninth, before running the United States out of rocks in the 10th for their well-deserved win. The gold medal match was a tense and well-played affair, as one would expect from two excellent shotmaking teams. It turned out to be the first men’s gold medal game in Olympic history to be decided in an extra end. Sweden built up an early 3-1 lead after three ends, but Great Britain chipped away and finally tied it at 3-3 in the seventh end. Sweden then picked up a single to take a one point lead, with Great Britain blanking the ninth end to retain the hammer. They were unable to manufacture two points for the win, however, and had to settle for one to send it to an extra, where Sweden prevailed after Bruce Mouat was unable to remove the Swedish shot stone with his own last rock. With the victory, Edin completed his climb up the Olympic podium to the pinnacle, finally adding gold to his previous silver and bronze finishes.

Going into the final round, Mitcham trailed Zhou by 32.50 points. He chose for his final dive a back 2½ sommie with 2½ twists, piked, with a huge degree of difficulty – 3.8. And he nailed it – getting four 10s, two 9.5s, and a single 9.0, to score 112.10, the highest scoring dive in Olympic history, which moved him 3.2 points ahead of Zhou, who won silver, while the bronze went to Galperin.
This was Australia’s first Olympic diving gold since Richmond Eve in 1924. Mitcham had started in sports on the trampoline. David Wallechinsky has noted in The Complete Book of the Olympics that Mitcham “was one of only 10 openly gay athletes to compete at the Beijing Olympics and the only openly gay male.”

This was the first swimming final of the Montréal Olympics and the American strategy was to let Pyttel set the pace, stay close to him, and then outsprint him on the final lap. However, the American trio of Forrester, Mike Bruner and Steve Gregg, runner-up at the 1973 Worlds, did not quite comply, as Forrester led to the 100 mark in 57.41, with Bruner second, Pyttel third, and Gregg, a strong finisher, back in fifth. Bruner took the lead at 150 metres, followed by Pyttel, with Gregg gaining water quickly. Bruner held on for the victory, Gregg closing quickly for silver, and Forrester completing the American sweep, as all three broke two minutes, led by Bruner’s world record of 1:59.23.

He opened with 21.16 (69-5¼) in round one, which led. It would be his best throw, and in fact, his only fair throw, as he followed with five fouls. In second after the first round was Ukraine’s Yuriy Bilonoh with 21.15 (69-4¾), only one centimeter back. He repeated that mark in round two but could do no better, and still trailed Nelson until the final round. In the final round Nelson had a marginal foul of around 21.30 (69-10¾), and had to settle for his opening mark. Bilonoh then threw 21.16 (69-5¼) in the final round to tie Nelson, but his next best mark was better than Nelson’s, who had no next best mark. Thus Nelson was again in second place. Finally in 2005, he would stop that trend, winning the World Championships.
But Nelson would eventually do better. In 2012 the IOC re-tested the drug samples from the Athens Olympics. Bilonoh would be disqualified in December 2012 when his doping sample revealed the presence of oxandrolone metabolite, an anabolic steroid. In June 2013 the IOC re-classified the medals, awarding Nelson the gold medal, with the silver medal going to Joachim Olsen and the bronze to Manuel Martínez.

The American team was given no chance before the Olympics and, in fact, lost to the Soviets 10-3, in an exhibition one week before the Olympics began. The team was coached by fanatical Herb Brooks, who had been the last player cut from the 1960 Olympic ice hockey team. As in 1960, most of the U.S. players were from Minnesota and Boston, but this time they were mostly college players. Brooks introduced them to a more wide-open passing game, imitating the international style, and put them through a punishing training program, guaranteeing them they would never be out-skated in the third period.
In the opening game the United States faced a strong Swedish team and trailed 2-1, with less than a minute in the game. Brooks pulled his goalie as Bill Baker scored to tie the game, 2-2. Next, the Americans met a strong Czechoslovakian team. Tied 2-2 after the first period, the USA out-skated the Czechs, and won 7-3. Late in that game, a Czech player violently checked American star Mark Johnson, and faced the wrath of Brooks, who threatened to jam his hockey stick down his throat. The US won three more games to advance to the medal round.
The USA and the USSR met in a final round game. Before the game, Brooks told his team in the locker room, “You were born to be players. You were meant to be here. This moment is yours.” And they were as the Americans won a stunning upset, 4-3, with Mike Eruzione scoring the winning goal with 11 minutes left to play. American goalie Jim Craig faced numerous Soviet rushes in the closing minutes, but stopped them all. As Brooks had promised, they were the ones with wings on their blades in the third period, outskating the Soviets, who suddenly appeared old and tired. With seconds remaining, as he counted down the clock, ABC television announcer, Al Michaels, asked the words all Americans were thinking, “Do you believe in miracles?” It was considered such an upset victory that the next day the Boston Herald headlined it on the front page of the newspaper, not the sports page, in 144 pt. type, with the simple words, “WE WON!”
At the medal ceremony, only the captains mounted the podium for ice hockey in that era. But captain Mike Eruzione called all his teammates up there and somehow 22 young American ice hockey players stood together on top of the podium – and the world. The USA victory was memorialized in several books and in 2004, in the movie - Miracle.

Both were in Barcelona and it was expected that they could again meet in the Olympic final, although without seeding the 1992 Olympic draw would have had them meeting in the quarter-finals. But that never came to be mostly because of the new controversial system. In round two Griffin faced Spain’s Rafael Lozano and punished him. All five judges had Griffin ahead in punches landed (19-9, 18-9, 26-17, 8-5, 10-9), but since a punch only counted if three of the five judges pushed their buttons within one second of one another, Griffin was only given credit for five effective punches, and lost the bout, 6-5. With Griffin out, Marcelo had an easy time of it. He defeated Lozano 11-3 in the quarter-finals, and defeated Bulgaria’s Daniel Bozhinov in the final, 24-10.
Bozhinov would come back in 1996 to win Olympic gold in this class, after winning the 1995 World Championship. Marcelo retired after Barcelona. Griffin turned professional but never had much success as a pro. He had one title shot in 1997 for the WBO light-flyweight crown, but lost it, and then retired with a record of 16-4.

The reigning World Champion at the distance, Zinaida Amosova, was not present, however, failing to qualify for the Soviet Olympic team.
At the halfway point, East Germany’s Barbara Petzold had taken the lead, almost 14 seconds ahead of Smetanina, with the other favorites closely following: the silver medalist from the 5 km race Hilkka Riihivuori in third, only 0.3 seconds behind Smetanina, then Takalo in fourth, another 1.9 seconds behind, and Kulakova in fifth place, 6 seconds behind Takalo. Kulakova was the first of the favorites to finish, but Takalo, starting half a minute behind, immediately took over the lead, finishing 13 seconds ahead of the Soviet veteran. Then everybody’s eyes were on the 24-year old leader Petzold. She finished 14 seconds stronger than Takalo, and Riihivuori, chasing Petzold from behind, arriving 3.5 seconds too late to beat the leading German woman. The final challenger was Smetanina, the winner of the 5 km race three days earlier. To everybody’s surprise she faded in the last part of the race and dropped down to fourth, outside the medal podium, 9 seconds behind Takalo.
Even if Petzold’s victory was a minor surprise, she had earlier shown great promise on the cross-country track. In 1974, at only 18-years-old, she won the silver medal at 10 km at the World Championships in Falun. In the 1976 Games she placed seventh at the distance, but her later progress was hampered by overtraining. She became the first ever German to win an Olympic cross-country gold medal.

The duo had never medaled at the World Championships, however, and thus the overwhelming favorites were the East Germans, who had won the last four editions, two of which with Ute Steindorf and Cornelia Klier, their crew in Moscow. Canada’s absence, due to the American-led boycott, was felt in this event, and it left the remaining podium spots much more open.
The surprising result in the opening round was the domination of the Soviet duo, Larisa Zavarzina and Galina Stepanova, since the USSR had only ever won one major international medal, silver at the 1975 World Championships, in this discipline. Nonetheless, Zavarzina and Stepanova finished over five seconds ahead of Steindorf and Klier, while the Polish pair of Małgorzata Dłużewska and Czesława Kościańska, bronze medalists at the most recent World Championships, won their easier heat. The final evolved into a tightly-contested race to the finish between Poland and East Germany, the latter of whom managed to win gold and set an Olympic record with less half a second to spare.

Nevertheless England, Scotland, Wales and Ireland had refused to play the Indian side during their tour of the home nations prior to the Olympics. They did beat a “Hockey Association XI” with 9 English internationals 4-0, and an Anglo-Scottish XI 7-3, which mostly likely prompted the British withdrawal.
The Indians breezed through the preliminary round, beating all opponents with at least a five goal difference while not conceding a single goal. The other finalist was the home nation. The Dutch had been playing hockey for some time, but under their own rules. These involved a soft ball, double-sided sticks, mixed teams and no shooting circle. Dutch team captain Rein de Waal spearheaded a switch to the international rules, and also managed to arrange training sessions with the Indian team. Thanks to a surprising 2-1 victory over heavily-favored Germany, the home team made it into the final.

But in preparation for the 1912 Olympics, the Swedes devised another 10-event multi-event with more emphasis placed on speed and jumping ability.  The first known competitions in the decathlon were conducted on 15 October 1911, both in Münster, Germany (won by Karl von Halt) and Göteberg, Sweden (won by Hugo Wieslander).  In June 1912, Wieslander won two further Swedish decathlons in preparation for the Olympic Games.  He was the Swedish favorite.
The American favorite was a remarkable Native American named Jim Thorpe.  A descendant of the Sac and Fox tribe and an Irish father, Thorpe had starred in both football and baseball, as well as track, at the Carlisle Indian School in Carlisle, Pennsylvania.  He had never competed in a decathlon prior to Stockholm, but at the eastern U.S. Olympic Trial in the pentathlon, he was so dominant that he was named to represent the United States in both the decathlon and the pentathlon.  The Stockholm decathlon was expected to be a closely fought contest between Wieslander and Thorpe.
It was not.  One week after winning the pentathlon, Jim Thorpe won the decathlon by an almost laughable margin, establishing a new world record, and defeating Wieslander by almost 700 points.  He won three events, had one second place, four thirds, and two fourths in the ten events.  Using point-for-place scoring, he scored 25 points to Wieslander’s 67 and Charles Lomberg’s 75.
At the closing ceremonies, Thorpe was presented his trophies by Sweden’s King Gustav V.  The legend is that the King told him, “Sir, you are the greatest athlete in the world,” and that Thorpe replied, “Thanks, King.”  Whether the legend is true or not, the King was correct.  But from 1913 until 1982 the Olympic record books invariably listed Hugo Wieslander as the 1912 Olympic decathlon champion.
In January 1913, newspaper stories broke noting that Jim Thorpe had played minor league baseball in North Carolina in 1909 and 1910.  The United States AAU reacted quickly and declared Thorpe a professional.  The IOC followed suit.  Thorpe’s Olympic victories were taken from him and he was ordered to return his medals and trophies.
But the story never died.  For years, many efforts were made to right what many perceived as a wrong and have the medals, the trophies, and the recognition returned to Jim Thorpe or his family.  The trophies included the Challenge Trophy for the decathlon, which had been donated by the Czar of Russia.  In 1982, the International Olympic Committee made partial restitution when they restored Thorpe’s amateur status, and declared him, in an unusual ruling, co-champion with Hugo Wieslander.
The story of Thorpe’s disqualification, the many attempts to restore his name, and the final work done which succeeded, is a long and complicated one.  See the Jim Thorpe bio for further details. However, the official announcement from the IOC on 15 July 2022 is as follows: “On 15 July 2022, on the day of the 110th anniversary of Thorpe’s medal in decathlon, the IOC announced its decision to display the name of Jim Thorpe as the sole gold medallist in pentathlon and decathlon at the Olympic Games Stockholm 1912. The IOC explained in its communication that this development was possible after the engagement of the Bright Path Strong organisation, supported by IOC Member Anita DeFrantz, who had contacted the Swedish Olympic Committee (SOC) and the surviving family members of Hugo K. Wieslander, who had been named as the gold medallist in decathlon when Thorpe was stripped of his medals in 1913. The family had confirmed that Wieslander himself had never accepted the Olympic gold medal allocated to him, and had always been of the opinion that Jim Thorpe was the sole legitimate Olympic gold medallist. The same declaration was received from the Norwegian Olympic and Paralympic Committee and Confederation of Sports, whose athlete, Ferdinand Bie, was named as the gold medallist when Thorpe was stripped of the pentathlon title.”

It was the fourth staging of the World Championships, having previously been held in Lyon (France) in 1897, Turin (Italy) 1898 and Loosduinen 1899 which, since 1923 has been a district of Den Haag (Netherlands).
The reigning World Champion Jesse Wallingford (Great Britain), did not defend his title in Paris. However, the 1898 champion Léon Moreaux, of France who also won a bronze medal in 1899, was out to regain his title. Other medallists from previous World Championships competing in Paris were Ole Østmo (Norway) (bronze 1897) and Achille Paroche (France) (silver 1898).
It was Paroche who narrowly won the gold medal from Denmark’s Anders Peter Nielsen and Ole Østmo. Paroche won four shooting medals in Paris and competed again at the 1920 Antwerp Olympics, winning a third silver medal. Nielsen competed in three more Olympics, in 1912, 1920 and 1924, but for Østmo this was his only Olympic appearance.

In Athens, however, three members of their crew, Meike Evers, Manuela Lutze, and Kerstin El-Qalqili, were returning from the 2000 event, while the fourth, Kathrin Boron, was a three-time Olympic champion in the double (1992 and 2000) and quadruple (1996) sculls.

But Decker was not running as well in 1984, and she elected to drop out of the 1,500 after finishing second at the Olympic Trials, deciding to concentrate on the 3,000. Her biggest challenge was expected to come from Romania’s Maricica Puică, who had been the world best in this event in 1981. Much of the pre-race hype, however, focused on South African Zola Budd, an 18-year-old prodigy who had been ranked #1 in the world in 1983 in the 5,000 metres. Budd also ran barefooted, which added to her allure. The problem was that in 1984 South Africa was not affiliated with the IOC, having been banned in 1968 because of apartheid and the fact that South Africa would not allow blacks to compete equally in sports. But Budd had an out. Her father’s father was British so she could legally apply for citizenship there if she set up residence in Great Britain. A few months before the Olympics she and her parents moved to Britain and shortly thereafter, she was granted British citizenship.
The stage was set for a top race, and all three runners made the final easily. In the final, Decker led the field thru the first 1,000. At 1,700 metres, she and Budd collided and Decker fell to the track. She had injured her hip and was unable to continue, crying on the infield, as the field continued. Budd was shaken, as Decker had been her idol, and she was further shaken when the American crowd booed her mercilessly throughout the race. Puică and Wendy Sly (GBR) went to the fore just before the bell and Budd could not respond. Puică took the lead on the final backstretch and won quite comfortably, with Sly holding on for the silver medal. Budd would finish seventh. After the race, Budd tried to apologize to Decker, who was quite angry, and ungraciously refused her apology. Budd was initially disqualified for the incident but after review of race tapes, it was determined that she was not at fault and her place was allowed to stand.

Of the three, only Lyubenov had won another recent World Championship medal (bronze in 1979), while Postriekhin was representing the defending Olympic champion and the 1977 and 1978 bronze medalist.

Finally, there was one returning medalist from the 1976 Olympics, Yugoslavia’s Matija Ljubek, who had earned bronze.
Four of these five men ended up in the same opening heat, in which Postriekhin, Varabiev, and Wichmann finished in that order, while Ljubek was last and advanced only as the slowest qualifier in the repêchage. Lyubenov, meanwhile, took the second, easier heat. The medal round came to an exciting conclusion as Bulgaria and the Soviet Union went neck and neck towards the finish line, with the latter edging out the former by a mere 0.12 seconds.

Only Italy and the United States entered the allowed maximum of four athletes per nation. There was no Alpine Combined event held, or even scheduled, for the ongoing World Cup season, or for the 2020/21 season either. The last event of this type in the World Cup was seen in February 2020 and was won by Federica Brignone. In total Brignone had won the last four World Cup Combined events and was unbeaten since March 2018. At the last two World Championships since the 2018 Olympics, the gold medals had been won by Wendy Holdener (2019) and Mikaela Shiffrin (2021).
The downhill element in Beijing was won by Christine Scheyer with Ester Ledecká second, and Ramona Siebenhofer third. Shiffrin put in a good performance and finished fifth as the best placed of the favourites with the other medal contenders being placed eighth (Brignone), 11th (Holdener) and 12th (Gisin). Those four were separated by only 0.44 seconds. In the slalom element, Shiffrin started as fifth but was again not able to finish the race as in the giant slalom and slalom days before, so she did not finish in her three best events.
It was Brignone who took over from the then leader Ledecká, but Holdener was 1.10 seconds faster in her slalom run to become the new leader. Her compatriot Gisin started just behind her and was again more than a second faster in the slalom to achieve the best run time and go on to win gold. The second-best slalom time was set by Katharina Huber but her margin after the downhill was too much to make up and she was only able to finish fifth overall.
Gisin repeated her win from 2018 in this event to become the first Swiss Alpine skier (women or men) to do so. She became the fourth woman to win back-to-back titles in Alpine skiing at the Olympics after Katja Seizinger (downhill 1994 and 1998), Deborah Compagnoni (giant slalom 1994 and 1998), and Janica Kostelić (combined 2002 and 2006). The one-two finish for Switzerland was their first ever in this event and only their third in Olympic history. The last time this happened for them was in downhill 1984 with Michela Figini and Maria Walliser.
All three 2022 medallists had already won a medal here in Beijing earlier, and all three did it in different events with Gisin in Super G, Holdener in slalom, and Brignone in giant slalom. Manufacture Rossignol took gold and bronze and silver went to Head.

In recent years, the duo had gotten competition from American Bonnie Blair, with the three occupying the podium at the past three World Sprint Championships, and dividing the medals in both 500 ms at the 1988 edition in West Allis. The trio had also divided the World Cup races of the season thus far: Kania had won one, Rothenburger and Blair two. To clarify that these three were the absolute favorites, they had all three held the world record in recent years. In 1983, Rothenburger had been the first to go below 40 seconds. She lost her record to Kania in 1986, who in turn lost it to Blair, in 1987. At the Calgary World Cup in December 1987, Rothenburger took the record back, setting the mark at 39.39.
Of the three title contenders, Rothenburger was the first to compete. In the second pair, she lowered the Olympic Record (set by Andrea Ehrig in the previous race at 40.71) by more than 1.5 seconds: 39.12 - a world record. Blair then took off in heat four. Her 100 m split, 10.55, was 0.02 faster than Rothenburger’s. That would prove to be enough to beat the East German, as Blair then copied the full lap time of Rothenburger, to finish in 39.10, again bettering the world record. As usual, Kania had a slower start than the two leaders, but was expected to have a better lap. She did, but it was not enough to overtake the two leaders.

At the 2011 World Championships, the title was shared between two outsiders, Aleksandra Gerasimenya and Jeanette Ottesen. Third then was Ranomi Kromowidjojo, who would become the first to swim below 53 seconds in the post-polyurethane era, when she clocked 52.75 in spring 2012. At the 4×100 m relay earlier in the Games, Kromowidjojo had by far clocked the fasted relay split, despite losing out to Australia’s Mel Schlanger in the final leg. Other favorites for the gold medal included Sweden’s Sarah Sjöström, 2012 European Champion and swimming 53.05 in late 2011, and home favorite Fran Halsall. Veteran swimmer Therese Alshammar suffered from a trapped nerve shortly before the Games, and decided to skip the event.
The semi-finals saw Steffen’s Olympic Record fall, Kromowidjojo lowering it to 53.05. Steffen herself was eliminated, as was Sjöström. Second best was Schlanger, three tenths back. In the final, it was Gerasimenya off to the best start, swimming from lane 1 (she had won the world title from lane 8).

In Rome the nation was represented by rowers from the United States Navy. Italy was a possible contender, having won the 1957 and 1958 European Championships, but it was Germany that most observers had their eye on, as they sent their 1959 European Championship-winning lineup to the 1960 Olympics. This crew was known as the “Ratzeburg” crew, even though their members came from both the Ratzeburg and Ditmarsia Kiel clubs, and their prowess was attributed partially to their new oar design. Finally there were the Canadians, who had won the 1958 British Empire and Commonwealth Games and been runners-up at the 1959 Pan American Games. Still, even with this slightly more open field, few could have predicted the final result.
The first shock came in the opening round, when the Canadians defeated their southern neighbors by nearly five seconds while, in another heat, the Germans also outperformed the Americans’ time by over four seconds and France was only 0.02 seconds off of the United States’ time. This forced the defending champions into a repêchage where, perhaps conserving their strength, they won their heat in a notably slow time and faced a legitimate challenge from Great Britain. Yet even if spectators might have predicted that the United States would finally be dethroned, they almost certainly could not have guessed that the country who had reigned supreme in the coxed eights for several decades would finish off the podium. The Germans, however, were clearly dominant and finished four seconds ahead of the Canadians, who took silver. Bronze went to Czechslovakia, the 1959 European runners-up, while the United States finished in fifth, nearly 11 seconds behind the gold-medal winning German crew, losing an Olympic final in the coxed eights for the first time in 60 years.

The final was somewhat closer, but Eicke still took it by over two seconds, while Cain grabbed silver nearly a second ahead of Jakobsen, who was third. No other competitor, including fifth-placed Olaru, was within six seconds of the podium finishers.

This event was one of the few in canoeing that was hurt by the American-led boycott of the tournament due to the absence of Norway’s Olaf Søyland and Einar Rasmussen, the reigning World Champions and 1978 runners-up. This left East Germany, the 1976 Olympic and 1977 World runner-up, as the only other nation to have won a major international medal in the event within the last four years, and it sent Peter Hempel and Harry Nolte.
The Soviet Union posted the fastest time in the opening round, defeating Hungary in the process, but the Spanish duo of Luis Ramos and Herminio Menéndez were only 0.22 seconds behind in winning their own heat ahead of East Germany. The third heat was taken by Cuba’s José Marrero and Reynaldo Cunill. East Germany was the fastest in the semi-finals, and bested Cuba, while the Soviet Union and Spain captured the remaining heats, the latter doing so at the expense of the Hungarians. The Soviet Union took charge in the final and won gold with little difficulty, but race for the remaining podium spots developed into an exciting three-way battle between Hungary, Spain, and Romania’s Alexandru Giura and Nicolae Ţicu. These nations crossed the finish line in that order with only 0.45 seconds between them. Both Soviets also won the K-2 500, while Parfenovich was a triple Olympic champion due to his success in the K-1 500. Menéndez, meanwhile, also took silver in the K-2 500.

The Soviets were also a factor, having been runners-up at the last two World Championships, as well as three of the last four European Championships (they were third in 1967).
In the opening round, the Americans performed poorly and lost their heat by nearly ten seconds to the New Zealanders. The East Germans won the other heat and also earned the fast time of the round. In the repêchage, the Americans barely survived to the finals, qualifying with the slowest time among the four who advanced (Czechoslovakia, Australia, and the Soviet Union were the others). Although American rowing crews had a reputation and a history for being able to pull themselves together for Olympic finals, there would be no such miracle in Mexico City. The West Germans earned a well-deserved gold medal by defeating the Australians by nearly a second. Australia settled for silver, while the Soviet Union managed to slip in for a bronze medal.

A tall, attractive blond, the former East German seemed about to capitalize on her fame with endorsements not previously available to her. But early in 1992 she and some of her teammates went to train in South Africa. There were accusations that this was done to avoid drug testing and the Germans responded by sending a testing team down there. All of the women tested negative but then it was revealed that all of the urine samples had come from the same person. They were all suspended for four years by the German Track Federation, but after appeals to the IAAF this was revoked. However, in June Krabbe withdrew from the Olympics, because of the stress she had been through in the past few months. In July she did test positive, this time for clenbuterol, and she never competed again.
With Krabbe out, the favorite’s role fell to Jamaica’s Merlene Ottey who had had been bronze medalist in 1980 and placed fourth in 1984. She had won medals at all three World Championships, though never a gold, and was 1990 Commonwealth Champion. Her biggest challenge was expected to come from American Gwen Torrence. Torrence was considered a possibility to win the 100/200 but a few days earlier had finished fourth in the 100. She then claimed that )Two of the three medalists are not clean. I’m sick and tired of it.) The 100 medalists had been Gail Devers (USA/gold), Juliet Cuthbert (JAM/silver), and Irina Privalova (EUN/bronze). Torrence never said who the two were, and a few days later she retracted her statement but it added to the controversy of the 200. In the final Torrence, Privalova, Cuthbert and Ottey were drawn in the middle of the track. The four were even as they came off the turn but Torrence was the strongest on the run-in and won by over 2/10ths from Cuthbert.

This move proved popular and undoubtedly helped propel the event towards Olympic status.
Each luger hit a touchpad at the end of their run, which then released a gate at the top of the course for the next luger to start their run and total time determining the winning team. As Germany had already won the individual and doubles events, the main question appeared to be who would take the minor medals.
Of the more favoured teams, Latvia set the early pace with a combined time of 2:47.295. This was immediately bettered by the host nation Russia who completed the course in a time of 2:46.679 and took over the lead. The United States and Italy then went down the course, but failed to dislodge the top two. Germany, using all their gold medallists, went on to post the best time of 2:45.649, over a second ahead of second placed Russia and completing a clean sweep of luge gold medals. Canada, starting next-to-last, briefly threatened to take the bronze medal, but eventually finished 0.1 seconds behind Latvia. With the German victory, Natalie Geisenberger became the first woman to win two luge gold medals at the same games.
The coach of the 4th place Canadian team was unhappy at what he believed were suspicious changes in track temperature during the event. The official data revealed that the track temperature rose by a degree between the runs of the 1st set of teams (which included Russia), and the higher ranking 2nd set of 5 teams, despite the air temperature falling by the same margin. When challenged to make an official protest over the incident, the Canadians declined.
In May 2016 WADA (World Anti-Doping Agency) commissioned a report, the McLaren Report, to look into allegations of systematic Russian doping and a cover-up to avoid positives at the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics. The report was released in two parts, in July and December 2016, and confirmed the allegations. In 2017 the IOC formed a commission to investigate this, headed by IOC Member Denis Oswald, and usually referred to as the Oswald Commission. In late October 2017 the Oswald Commission began to release its findings.
On 22 December 2017 Albert Demchenko and Tatyana Ivanova were disqualified as a result of the Oswald Commission findings, which disqualified the silver medal winning Russian team. They immediately appealed this decision to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS), and about 10 days before the PyeongChang Winter Olympics began, the CAS reached a decision and both athletes were exonerated and the Russian silver medal was restored.

In 1971, 1972, and 1975 she was World Cup champion in the downhill, giant slalom, and overall, and added downhill and overall titles in 1973-74, winning the downhill World Championship in 1974. At the 1972 Winter Olympics, as Annemarie Pröll, she was favored in both the downhill and giant slalom but had skied poorly, for her, and won only silver medals in both races. After her 1975 World Cup season, she got married and retired, skipping the 1976 Innsbruck Olympics. But early in 1977 she returned to the circuit and her dominance of the downhill, winning the World Cup again in 1978 and 1979. But in 1980 she was frustrated by an old nemesis, Marie-Theres Nadig, who had won the 1972 downhill gold medal that Pröll had so wanted. In the early World Cup lead-up to Lake Placid, Nadig had won six downhills and Moser-Pröll only one. But on Whiteface, Moser-Pröll was an easy winner, going off as the sixth starter, and posting 1:37.52, which defeated Hanni Wenzel by 0.70 seconds and Nadig, the bronze medalist, by 0.84. Moser-Pröll would retire for good after the 1980 season, ending her career with numerous records for the World Cup that still stand over 25 years later. She won six overall World Cups, seven downhill World Cups, 18 World Cup titles in all, and 62 World Cup races, 36 of those in the downhill, and 16 in giant slalom – all records. Her records would have been even better had she skied in the era of the super-G, an event she would likely have dominated.

Simone Manuel, the 2016 100 freestyle gold medallist and 2019 World Champion in this event, was also back, but she would not make it out of the semi-finals.
For McKeon, the final day of swimming in Tokyo had big implications as she came into this event having already won five medals in 2020. She was likely a slight favorite as she had led both the heats and the semi-finals.
In the final McKeon had one of the slowest reaction times at 0.70, only leaving the blocks ahead of her teammate Cate Campbell, who reacted in 0.76. However, she overcame that to win gold fairly comfortably (0.26 seconds) over Sjöström, with Blume taking bronze, as Kromo just missed the podium in fourth.
For McKeon this was her sixth medal of the Tokyo 2020 Olympics, a feat that only been done before by nine women, and by two other female swimmers – Kristin Otto of the GDR (East Germany) in 1988 and Natalie Coughlin of the USA in 2008. Less than an hour later McKeon would swim the butterfly leg as Australia won the women’s medley relay, giving her seven medals at Tokyo, matching the all-time women’s Olympic best in any sport, set by Soviet gymnast Mariya Gorokhovskaya at Helsinki in 1952.

However, in a random blood test shortly before Salt Lake City, Mühlegg was found to have an elevated hematocrit level, indicating possible drug use. Only a few minutes later, however, a repeat test showed an acceptable hematocrit level, and Mühlegg was allowed to continue competing. By the time this race started, he had apparently won two gold medals at the 2002 Winter Olympics, in the pursuit and 30 km. In the 50 km race the early leader was Russian Mikhail Ivanov who had been bronze medalist at the 2001 Worlds in the 30 km. He was still leading at the final 40.5 km checkpoint, but on the last lap would be passed by Mühlegg, who finished very quickly. Rounding out the podium appeared to be Estonia’s Andrus Veerpalu, who had won the 15 km gold 11 days before, and was well ahead of Norwegian Odd Bjørn Hjelmeset.
But that podium did not last long. Mühlegg failed his post-race doping screen, testing positive for darbopoietin, an erythropoietin analogue. He was disqualified from the race, and the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) ruled in December 2003 that he should be stripped of all three gold medals from the 2002 Winter Olympics. Thus, Ivanov was moved up to the gold medal, Veerpalu to silver, and Hjelmeset won the bronze. A few days later after the 2002 Winter Olympics ended, housecleaners working on the house used by the Austrian cross-country team found blood transfusion equipment. After an investigation, two of the Austrian skiers, Marc Mayer and Achim Walcher, were disqualified from the 2002 Winter Olympics for probable blood doping, This also affected the standings in this race, as Mayer had originally placed 25th.

Four years earlier he was overshadowed by his countryman Thorleif Haug and had to be content with one silver and two bronze medals, but in 1926 he was the first World Champion in Nordic Combined.
The weather had changed again. Now the föhn was over, and the temperature was stable around -7° C. The track was icy and fast with a height difference of 400 m, demanding great technical skills from the skiers.
At the halfway point Grøttumsbraaten had a commanding lead over Ole Hegge, the only competitor from the 50 km. event who was able to fight for a medal, and the Finn Martti Lappalainen. In the last part of the race the Norwegian quartet dominated the race, but a strong finish by the best of the Finns, Veli Saarinen, prevented the Norwegians from taking the first four places.
Grøttumsbraaten won his first gold, Hegge was second and Reidar Ødegård from Lillehammer came in third. The Swedish favorite, Sven Utterström, was apparently still not recovered from his illness and ended as a disappointing 8th. The Scandinavian skiers were still dominating, taking the first nine places. Czechoslovakia had the best Middle European team with their best skiers in 10th and 11th place.
Ole Hegge, originating from the Tromsø area far behind the Artic Circle, was the first Olympic medallist from the Arctic Region and an extremely talented skier.

The standing triple jump was contested again at St. Louis in 1904 but was then discontinued at the Olympics. American Irv Baxter won the silver medal as he had done in the standing high jump and long jump.
Though now termed the standing triple jump, in this era the event was usually called the hop, step, and jump. However, the rules, and the techniques used, varied greatly at this time. Recent research by members of the Association of Track & Field Statisticians (ATFS), strongly suggest that Ewry, at the least, used three standing jumps in this competition rather than any continuous hop, step, or jump combination.

Instead the real threat to Zöggeler came from another veteran slider in the shape of 34-year-old Albert Demchenko of Russia. Demchenko was in the form of his life and had won the 2006 European Championship and the 2004-05 World Cup title. Things went relatively smoothly for the Italian on the first day and he led the field but the gap over Demchenko and America’s Tony Benshoof  was not enough to yet to be confident of victory. In fact the Russian did close slightly on Zöggeler during the second half of the event but not by the required margin and the Italian, watched by six million of his countrymen on TV, became the second man to retain an Olympic luge title.

Ogiwara’s strength was jumping, but he finished only sixth on the hill, with Lundberg leading the ski jumping over Estonia’s Ago Markvardt, who was not considered a strong skier. Lundberg’s margin for the 15 km was 23 seconds over Markvardt but more importantly, 1:46 over Ogiwara. Lundberg skied conservatively, as everyone near him after the jumping was not considered strong enough to catch him in the cross-country. He placed eighth in the 15 km, but won the gold medal by 1:17.5. Ogiwara was only 11th in the skiing and dropped out of the medals, but the silver medal surprisingly went to his teammate, Takanori Kono, who had been fourth in the ski jumping and was able to move up to second, despite placing 13th in skiing. The bronze medalist, Norwegian Bjarte Engen Vik, would come back to win the gold medal in 1998 at Nagano.

One quarter-final saw Croatia meet their arch-rivals, Serbia & Montenegro, or effectively what remained of Yugoslavia. The Croats hated the Serbs for what they had done to their country in the early 1990s, and gained a measure of revenge by defeating them, 8-6.

At the first exchange, three teams were close together. Norway’s Oddvar Brå and Sweden’s Thomas Magnusson came in together, with Soviet’s Vladimir Voronkov only two seconds behind, while Switzerland was in fourth place, 44 seconds behind the leader. On the second leg, Soviet Yury Skobov and Norway’s Pål Tyldum were close together at the exchange, with Sweden’s Lars-Göran Åslund in third place over a minute behind. When Norway’s 20-year old Ivar  Formo built up a 1:01 lead on the third leg over Soviet’s Fyodor Simashov, it looked like an easy victory for the defending champions. Sweden in third was now only 20 seconds behind the Soviets, and the silver medalist from the Nordic Combined in 1968, Alois Kälin, brought Switzerland up from sixth to fourth, only two seconds behind Sweden.
The Soviet’s anchor leg skier Vyacheslav Vedenin started strongly, and after 5 km he had reduced the gap to the Norwegian Johs Harviken to around half a minute. The Soviets now began to hope for victory, and 100 m from home Vedenin had caught Harviken. In a desperate try to counterattack, Harviken fell, and Vedenin secured Soviet’s second Olympic relay gold, 16 years after their first win in Cortina d’Ampezzo. The fight for the bronze medal also ended in drama. Sweden’s Sven-Åke Lundbäck and Switzerland’s Edi Hauser arrived in the finishing stretch together, then Lundbäck fell and Hauser garnered for Switzerland their first ever Olympic cross-country relay medal. Alois Kälin is still the last skier, thru 2006, with Olympic medals both in cross-country skiing and Nordic Combined.

But Fraser came into the slalom after finishing only 11th in the downhill, while Beiser had won a silver medal in that event. Beiser’s overall lead after the downhill enabled her to narrowly win gold in the combined, with Fraser second and Mahringer third.

The contest for third place was just as interesting, with Marie Dorin of France who started in that position, fading to finish 17th. It was her compatriot, Marie Laure Brunet, who gradually moved up from 6th place at the start into third place, half way around the course, and remain there for the rest of the race, taking the bronze medal, some 28.3 seconds behind Neuner. Remarkable runs from Anna Carin Olofsson-Zidek and Tora Berger of Norway saw them move from 20th and 33rd up to 4th and 5th place respectively.
Neuner was known for her erratic shooting but arrived in Vancouver with a run of victories in World Cup events. Olofsson-Zidek was a little unfortunate as race officials made a mistake and held her for an extra 14 seconds at the start.

One potential threat was Ireland’s Seán Drea, who had won three of the last four Diamond Challenge Sculls at the Henley Royal Regatta (Australian Ted Hale was the victor in 1976) in addition to a silver medal at the most recent World Championships. Another was Argentina’s Ricardo Ibarra, successor to the great Alberto Demiddi and Pan American champion in 1975. The defending Olympic champion nation, the Soviet Union, sent the relatively unheralded Mykola Dovhan.
Kolbe dominated the opening round; only Drea, who was in the same heat, came within five seconds of his time. Ibarra and Dovhan won the other heats, but with times that would not have automatically qualified them in Kolbe’s. In the semi-finals, Ibarra surprised the spectators by winning the heat in record time, with Kolbe coming in only 0.18 seconds ahead of East Germany’s Joachim Dreifke to claim the second qualifying spot. Not to be outdone, Drea came in nearly five seconds ahead of Ibarra to win his own heat, thus promising an exciting final. At first it seemed that the rowers might disappoint: for nearly the entire race, Kolbe led while the others trailed by a significant margin. In the last 100 metres, however, the then relatively-unknown Finn Pertti Karppinen launched a magnificent sprint and stole the gold medal from Kolbe. This result was even more surprising because Karppinen had only survived round one by winning the repêchage and had been the last qualifier in his semi-final heat. Kolbe therefore had to settle for silver while Dreifke, who came in over six seconds later, took bronze.

The final pairs of the second run started with Ren against Wolf. With a sound lap, the Chinese neared the time of Zhurova from the first run, with 38.27. This left Okazaki with a hard target for the bronze medal, and she just failed to get it, missing out by 0.05 seconds. The final pair was between the two leaders, Wang and Zhurova. Nearly equal at the bell, Zhurova edged away in the final straight to 38.34. That time was not enough to win the second heat, but good enough for a long awaited gold medal, ahead of the two Chinese sprinters, Wang and Ren.

The final saw the lead exchanged several times with Hungarian Katinka Hosszú leading on the butterfly and backstroke legs, but Beisel took over on the breaststroke, only to see Ye pass her just before the final stroke change. The final freestyle was all Ye, who came home in 58.68, with the final 50 done in a stunning 28.93, for a world record 4:28.43. This was the first individual world record since the skinsuit era, and was over a second better than Rice’s world record set in winning this event in Beijing. Beisel took silver, while Ye’s teammate Li Xuanxu came home for the bronze, Hosszú finishing fourth, with Rice back in a tie for fourth with American Caitlin Leverenz.
Ye’s victory was not without some controversy, as her finish was stunning, but some thought it was “too good”. In his 400 IM gold medal on the same night, Ryan Lochte had finished in only 58.65 for the final 100, and Ye actually outswam him on the final 50, as he posted 29.10. Several American coaches and officials openly said that Ye’s mark had to be performance enhanced, though she passed all her drug tests, and the IOC actually had to come to Ye’s defense in a press release. It was redolent of the 1976 Olympics when Shirley Babashoff made similar comments about the East German female swimmers, allegations which in that case were eventually proven to be true.

Conlan responded with a barrage of foul mouthed abuse towards the sport’s governing body and accusing them of cheating him out of his Olympic dream. He was fined for his behaviour but, since he had already turned professional by the time of the announcement, refused to pay. To make things even worse he was later reprimanded by the IOC for placing bets on other bouts during the Olympic boxing tournament.
Nikitin, suffering from facial injuries incurred during his fight with Conlan, withdrew from his semi-final which allowed Shakur Stevenson to be the only male American to reach a boxing final in Rio. Stevenson’s opponent would be the 2012 flyweight champion Robeisy Ramírez of Cuba. Ramírez fought on four occasions to reach the gold-medal bout, while Stevenson only fought twice after an opening round bye and the semi-final walkover.
The two finalists put on a high-level display for the crowd and shared the first two rounds. The third saw the Cuban land with 18 punches to 17 from Stevenson though Ramírez threw many more punches and appeared busier than his opponent. This was enough to convince two of the three judges to vote for Ramírez and make him only the sixth boxer to win Olympic gold in two weight divisions.
For Stevenson, who was named in honour of the rap artist Tupac Shakur, this was his first defeat in international competition.

The leader when the competition was stopped was Aleksandr Popov of Belarus, but the next day he would shoot poorly, ski slower, and place 55th. But on the postponed day, Popov would likely not have won, as Norway’s Ole Einar Bjørndalen was well ahead of his pace. Bjørndalen was leading the World Cup race in the 1997-98 season, had placed second in 1996-97, and was one of the favorites. On the day of the re-scheduled event, he dominated the race, shooting cleanly and winning by over one minute. In second was his teammate, Frode Andresen, who was fortunate about the weather delay, as on the first day he had missed four of his first five targets.
Andresen would become one of the top biathletes in the world in the next few years, winning the sprint at the 2000 World Championships, and four medals at the 1999 and 2000 Worlds. But Bjørndalen would soon become the greatest biathlete ever, and one of the greatest athletes in any sport. At Salt Lake City in 2002, he would four gold medals, helping Norway win the relay, and winning all three individual events. Through 2009 he had won 33 medals at the World Championships, including 14 titles. Bjørndalen was an excellent cross-country skier, having won a 2006 World Cup race in that sport, and placing fifth in the 2002 Winter Olympic 30 km.

Usain Bolt had already won the 100 and 200 in world record times, and his teammate, Asafa Powell, was the 100 world-record holder coming into 2008. Aided by Nesta Carter and Michael Frater, it was thought that only poor baton passing could get the US ahead of the Caribbean powerhouse. But the US team never even got the chance. In the first heat of round one, Darvis Patton ran the third leg for the US and was leading as he went to hand-off to Tyson Gay. But the two dropped the baton and the US was out of the heat and the final. This left the way open for Jamaica to run virtually uncontested, though it is highly unlikely the US could have beaten Jamaica in the final, even at their absolute best. Jamaica dominated the final, shattering the previous world record of 37.40, to record 37.10. Bolt ran the third leg on the curve, clocking an estimated 9.0 around the turn, and Asafa Powell’s anchor was timed by tafnuts in 8.7. This gave Bolt his third sprint gold medal of the Beijing Olympics, all in world record time, a feat which had never been performed at the Olympics.
That was how the event and the results seemed to have ended. In 2015, however, the IOC began re-testing samples from the 2008 Beijing and 2012 London Olympics, using newer, more advanced testing techniques, in an effort to find those who had used performance enhancing drugs (PEDs), but in whom it could not be detected at the time of those Olympics. This was one of the many events affected.
In January 2017 Jamaican Nesta Carter was revealed to have a positive re-test for methylhexaneamine. The possible disqualification would impact on the stellar Olympic record of Jamaican sprint great Usain Bolt, since Carter’s positive test would also disqualify the Jamaican team and Bolt would lose this gold medal. However, Carter appealed this decision to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS). On 31 May 2018 the appeal was dismissed by the CAS and Carter and the Jamaican team remained disqualified, which cost Bolt his ninth gold medal. Trinidad & Tobago received their gold medals at a ceremony at the Olympic Museum in Lausanne, Switzerland on 5 July 2022.

America’s Emily deRiel led after the shooting phase, but Yelizaveta Suvorova took the lead after the fencing and swimming phases. However, deRiel also won the fourth phase, the show jumping, and took back the lead going in to the cross-country run. Cook was known to be the best runner. She was only in eighth, 198 points back but was still considered dangerous. In the run, she passed deRiel about 300 metres from the line and won by about 3 seconds, and eight points. The bronze medal was won by Britain’s Kate Allenby, causing Stephanie Cook to comment on the British medal “sweep” – “We also consider Emily British as she trains with us at Oxford.” Cook was a medical doctor who took time off her medical career to train for Sydney. She retired after winning three gold medals at the 2001 World Championships and went back to medicine. She had worked as a volunteer for the Israeli Ambulance Service in Jerusalem and would later work with survivors of the Gujurat earthquake.”

Like in Rio, the first rounds were limited to the lower ranked players. Higher ranked players were gradually introduced until the third round when the world’s 16 best ranked players joined the tournament. This scheme had already been applied in previous Olympics. All matches were played to the best-of seven, with the first to win four games taking the match.
In the women’s world ranking list, China was even more dominant than in the men’s event. Chen Meng and Sun Yingsha topped the list and, as expected, faced each other in the final. The country also took another five spots in the top ten in July 2021. Only the world’s third seed Mima Ito from Japan broke into the Chinese phalanx. It was not that easy for Chen, who lost games in both the fourth round and quarter-final. In the latter, she trailed 2-0 to Doo Hoi Kem, representing Hong Kong, but came back to win 4-2. Sun, on the other hand, did not lose a single game before the final, where she lost 4-2 to compatriot Chen.
The bronze medal for Ito also came as no surprise after she was defeated in the semi-final in a one-sided match by Sun Yingsha. The big surprise was her opponent in the bronze medal match, Yu Mengyu from Singapore. Only seeded 45th in the world ranking list and 26th in the tournament ranking list, she eliminated Cheng I-Ching from Chinese Taipei in straight games and Japan’s Kasumi Ishikawa, who were ranked fourth and fifth, respectively, in the tournament rankings.

At Barcelona she tried the same tactic in the final, but this time the field did not go away. At the halfway point, most of the field was still in contact, and at 6,000 metres, South Africa’s Elana Meyer moved to the front. She quickly opened a gap, but was then chased down by Ethiopia’s Derartu Tulu. Together they had broken the field and ran together until the bell. Then Tulu pulled away and Meyer could not respond, Tulu winning by almost six seconds. American Lynn Jennings ran a huge PR to get the bronze medal, while McColgan finished in fifth place.
The gold and silver medal won by Tulu and Meyer had special sociologic implications. Tulu was a black African, while Meyer was a white South African. South African had been banned from the Olympics since 1964, because of the treatment of blacks in that nation, and Meyer’s silver medal was the first for her nation since 1960. They did not know each other well. But at the finish line, Tulu waited for Meyer to trail in behind her and they then ran together, hand-in-hand, on a victory lap. David Wallechinsky has written that this “seemed to symbolize hope for a new Africa”.

Davis had won the 2005 World Allround Championships, and in 2004 he had won the 1500 m world title as well. His 2005/2006 record in the 1,000 m was superb, making him the top favorite for the gold. He had taken part in six of nine World Cup races, and won them all (taking the rest off to try and qualify for the US Olympic short track team). In passing, Davis also bettered the world record, which dated from the 2002 Olympics and set it at 1:07.03. The only question mark was his performance at the recent World Sprint Championships, where he had “only” placed 6th and 3rd in the 1000 ms. Races there were won by two-time Olympic runner-up Jan Bos and 2001 World Champion Jeremy Wotherspoon. Other contenders were World Sprint Champion and 500 m winner Joey Cheek and 2003 and 2004 World Champion Erben Wennemars.
Davis was the first of the favorites to skate, with 5,000 m champion Chad Hedrick leading at that moment. Skating behind Wotherspoon for the first lap and a half, Davis unleashed his usual fast final lap, to finish in 1:08.89. Davis’s relatively slow start left room for Cheek and former world record holder Lee Gyu-Hyeok, as both went neck-on-neck for the first 600 m. But neither could match Davis’s closing 26.6 lap, and finished at 1:09.16 and 1:09.37. The remaining pair featured two Dutchmen, Bos and Wennemars. The two went off more conservatively, but met with the same fate as Cheek, losing time in the final lap. Eventually, Wennemars edged ahead of Bos and narrowly took the bronze medal ahead of Lee. Cheek announced he would donate his silver medal bonus ($15,000) to the “Right to Play” charity, which he had also done with his 500 m bonus.

The Belgian led the bars in the Tokyo qualifying competition and Simone Biles just managed to make it to the final despite finishing 10th. Because four members of the ROC team finished in the top eight, only the top two qualified, and therefore allowed Biles to qualify for all four apparatus finals. However, because of her mental health issues in Tokyo, Biles pulled out of the uneven bars, and her place was taken by Mélanie de Jesus dos Santos of France.
The first two in qualification were the double world champion Derwael, and the recently crowned individual all-round Olympic champion Sunisa Lee of America. Lee was the first to go and had a slight setback early in her routine which cost her, and she opened with a score of 14.500. Late replacement dos Santos could only score 14.033 next, and then it was Derwael who impressed with 15.200 and took the lead. Anastasiya Ilyankova of the ROC was third in qualification and posed the only probably threat to the Belgian’s lead, but her 14.833 was only good enough to put her into the silver medal position, and that is where she stayed, with Lee taking the bronze.
Derwael became the first woman to win a gymnastics medal of any colour for Belgium, and was the first person, male or female, to win a gymnastics gold. Belgian’s last Olympic medal was the bronze in the 1920 men’s all-round team (Swedish System) event.

His chances were further helped when world silver medallist Pichai Sayota failed to qualify for Athens.

Khan then defeated the champions of Europe and Asia in his unexpected progression to the Olympic final.
The young Briton fought well but the experience gained by the Cuban in his years at the top of amateur boxing proved far too much for Khan and Kindelan’s expertise helped him retain the Olympic title with a margin of 8 points. An illustration of the two fighters’ relative experience was that while the Olympic final was only Khan’s 14th senior fight it was the 330th of Kindelan’s career.

American John Godina came thru in the fourth and fifth rounds with 20.64 (67-8¾) and 20.79 (68-2½), to move into the lead in round five. Barnes was only in fourth place heading into the final round, but he produced – tossing the shot 21.62 (70-11¼) for the gold medal. Bagach also improved, bumping Dal Soglio out of the medals with 20.75 (68-1). In May 1990, Barnes had tested positive for methyltestosterone and was banned for two years. In April 1998, he tested positive for androstenedione and was banned for life. The life ban was controversial as androstenedione was an over-the-counter supplement in the United States and was not a banned drug internationally until a few months before Barnes’s positive test. He readily admitted taking it, not knowing it was banned. It was the same drug taken by major league home run king Mark McGwire, who also admitted to taking it. Bronze medalist Bagach also was subsequently banned for life. He had tested positive in 1989 for testosterone, tested positive for ephedrine in 1997 at the World Championships, and was banned for life in 2000 after a positive doping test for anabolic steroids.

Hungary’s Katalin Kovács was foremost among them, as she had 18 European and 23 World Championship titles to her name, six of which were from the K-1 500, including ones from the most recent edition of each tournament. She was also representing the nation that had won the event at the last Olympics and the 2006 European and World Championships. Not to be counted out, however, was Josefa Idem who was competing in her seventh Olympics and was, among many other things, the 2000 Olympic champion. More recently she had been the 2006 World runner-up and the 2008 European bronze medalist.
Kovács and Idem won their heats in the opening round, while third was taken by Germany’s Katrin Wagner-Augustin, the 2007 European champion and 2008 runner-up, as well as the 2007 World bronze medalist. The medal round was an incredibly close affair, with Inna Osypenko of Ukraine, Idem, Wagner-Augustin, and Kovács finishing in that order within half a second of each other. Osypenko’s victory was as much a surprise as Kovács missing the podium, as the Ukrainian’s only World Championship medals had been silver and bronze in the 2003 and 2001 K-4 1000 respectively, although she was also a 2004 Olympic K-4 500 bronze medalist. Wagner-Augustin, meanwhile, added bronze to the gold medal that she had won in the K-4 500 the previous day.

That left the way for three men to seriously challenge for the podium places. One was the 2015, and reigning, World champion Shi Zhiyong of China. Another contender was the 2015 World bronze medalist and 2016 European champion Daniýar Ismaýilow of Turkey, and Kim Myong-Hyok of Korea, fourth at the 2012 Olympic Games, was the third man to be amongst the favourites for a medal. Based on being named the outstanding lifter at the 2016 Pan American Championships, where his total of 336 kg was more than Ismaýilow ‘s 333 kg winning lift at the European Championships, Bredni Roque, a former Cuban, competing for Mexico, was considered a serious outsider with a medal chance.
A lot of lifters were going bold with their starting weights in the snatch, which resulted in Ketut Ariana of Indonesia bombing out early. Kim, failed with all his clean and jerk attempts. Luís Javier Mosquera of Colombia took the lead with three lifters remaining, setting a new personal best at 155 kg, but Shi was on a mission, and Ismaýilow was not going to make it easy. After a 162 kg snatch, Shi clinched the gold medal with a 190 kg clean & jerk for a 352 kg total, holding off the challenge by Ismaýilow (formerly of Turkmenistan) who made six good lifts and lost the gold by just one kilo. Shi attempted an Olympic record in the clean & jerk, but was unsuccessful.
With this Olympic win, Shi became an Olympic champion just like the man whose name he was given when he was a teenager. At that time, his coach, two-time Olympic champion Zhan Xugang, renamed him after the elder Shi Zhiyong, the 2004 Olympic champion and national hero.
Ismaýilow, who had finished 13th at the 2012 Olympic Games, took home the silver medal. Izzat Artykov who first entered international competition in 2010 in the lightest category (56 kg), and whose strength had improved enormously over the years, won the bronze medal with a 339 kg total. It was the first Olympic weightlifting medal for Kyrgyzstan, but he was subsequently disqualified after testing positive for strychnine. Mosquera was upgraded to bronze.

At the 2021 World Championships she had been bested by Ema Klinec of Slovenia, who had also won the event at the 2016 Winter Youth Olympics, but finished only 14th in 2018. The runner-up in 2018 had been Germany’s Katharina Althaus, while Sara Takanashi of Japan was the most recent Olympic and World bronze medalist.
The surprise winner of the event was another Slovenian, Urša Bogataj, who had never before won an individual event as a senior, yet had the furthest jump of the entire competition in round one. Although she had collected medals at the 2012 Youth Winter Olympics, she had placed only 30th in the normal hill at the 2018 PyeongChang Games, and her only other medal was silver in the team normal hill at the most recent World Championships. Her victory made her only the second Slovenian Winter Olympic champion, after Alpine skier Tina Maze.
Bogataj’s compatriot Nika Križnar, who had been seventh in 2018, took bronze, after ranking third and second in rounds one and two respectively, making it the first time that two Olympians from the same country had stood on the podium in a women’s ski jumping event. Križnar was also a team silver medalist from the 2021 Worlds and had taken bronze individually that year in the large hill. Althaus, who was ahead in round one, dropped to third in round two and repeated her silver medal performance from 2018. Takanashi and Klinec, meanwhile, placed fourth and fifth respectively.

It mattered little to Hungary’s Krisztina Egerszegi, who had won the silver medal in this event in 1988, trailing East German Kristin Otto. But since Seoul Egerszegi had been the world’s best backstroker, winning both events at the 1991 World and European Championships and setting world records in both events. When this event started she already had one gold in Barcelona, in the 400 IM, which she added to her 200 backstroke gold from Seoul. She would later win the 200 back, giving her four gold medals.
The final was delayed by 15 minutes because of the preceding race, the men’s 100 free, which required a review of the tape. Egerszegi went out ahead early, although American Lea Loveless stayed close throughout. But she could never move ahead and Egerszegi won her second Barcelona gold in 1:00.68, the third fastest performance ever. Loveless was passed near the end by Egerszegi’s teammate Tünde Szabó.

In 1924 it would be France’s time to win gold, with Hungary and Belgium the other finalists, in addition to Italy. But France’s gold medal came in amid controversy. When France and Italy met in the final round-robin pool, France took a 3-1 bout lead when Lucien Gaudin and Aldo Boni faced off. The match was tied at four touches each when Hungarian referee György Kovács awarded the winning fifth touch to Gaudin, which incensed Boni. He verbally assaulted Kovács in Italian. Kovács asked the Italian-born Hungarian fencing master Italo Santelli what Boni said and when Santelli gave the translation into Hungarian, Kovács went to the Jury of Appeal which demanded an apology.  Boni refused, and the Italian team, withdrew singing the Italian national anthem, forfeiting their matches against Belgium and Hungary.  The silver medal went to Belgium based on their 9-7 victory over Hungary.
After the Olympics, the Italian team issued a statement alleging that Santelli had supported the referee because he was the coach of the Hungarian team and it would help them win a medal. When he learned of this, Santelli challenged Adolfo Contronei, the Italian captain to a duel. Santelli’s son, Giorgio, was concerned for his father, who was then over 60 years old, and invoked the code duello to replace his father in the coming battle. Government permission to fight the duel was obtained and on August 28 Giorgio Santelli and Contronei met in the small Italian town of Abbazia (later Opatija in Croatia) close to the Hungarian border, fighting with heavy sabres. Santelli slashed Contronei on his head, drawing blood, which caused doctors to intervene and stop the duel.

Unfortunately, the American coaches had it wrong, and the decisive loss gave Pinigin the gold medal, with Kaeser dropping to silver.

But two other Americans began to challenge him in the interim between Olympics.  John Paul Jones, a college runner at Cornell, won the IC4A title in both 1911 and 1912.  But a Philadelphia high school student, James Edwin “Ted“ Meredith, of Mercersburg Academy, came to prominence at both 440 and 880 yards early in 1912, setting interscholastic records at both distances only a few weeks before the Olympic trials.  At the eastern Olympic Trials, Meredith ran third behind Sheppard.
The best of the Europeans were Germany’s Hanns Braun, who had won the AAA title in 1911 and 1912, and Italy’s Emilio Lunghi, who equalled Sheppard’s world record of 1:52.8 (set at the London Olympics) in winning the 1909 Canadian Championship.  At La Spezia, on 23 June, Lunghi confirmed his fitness with a 400/800 double of 49.0 and 1:55.0.
The five favorites all survived the first round, but John Paul Jones did not compete in the semi-finals.  The American trainer, Michael Murphy, thought he had a better chance at 1,500 metres, so he withdrew Jones to save him for the longer race.  In the second semi, Lunghi faltered in the stretch and finished fifth, one place from qualifying for the final.
In the final, Mel Sheppard led out at a very fast pace, reaching 400 metres in 52.4.  But entering the homestretch, Sheppard could not hold off Ted Meredith, who won by inches in a world record time of 1:51.9.  Ira Davenport (USA) came up fast in the last 200 metres to take the bronze medal.  Meredith continued to a second tape set at 880 yards, passing that mark in 1:52.5, also a world record.
The official results for the non-medalists, from the Official Report, were 4) Braun 1:52.2; 5) David Caldwell 1:52.3; and 6) Melville Brock - no time.  But concerning places 4-6, Olympic Track & Field states that, “However, these places and times do not stand up under close scrutiny of available photographs and reports from various sources.  We here list ‘revised’ results.”  The revised results that they listed were 4) Brock 1:52.7e; 5) Caldwell 1:52.8e; and 6) Braun 1:53.1e.
Quercetani and Kök describe this problem as follows: “Even the expert Swedish judges made mistakes in determining the other places, notably in giving a fourth place to Braun in 1:52.2, a time which the German federation recognized in … 1924.  In reality, the most dependable witnesses say that the exhausted Braun finished in slow motion, beaten by Caldwell and possibly even by Brock.  Without guaranteeing absolute exactness (photographs, taken mostly before the finish and at different angles, don’t help much) the order of finish from fourth onwards can be tentatively reconstructed as follows (times are estimated): 4. Caldwell 1:52.8; 5. Brock 1:53; 6. Braun 1:53; 7. Hec Edmundsen; 8. Herbert Putnam.”

Picon won the opening race and after three races was in the lead with Lu and de Geus well back, despite de Geus winning the third race. Picon won the fifth race but after seven phases she was in a virtual tie with Britain’s Emma Wilson, who won races four and seven. Wilson repeated in race eight to move ahead but, heading into the medal race, Lu had taken the lead, as she steadily accumulated runner-up finishes. The medals were decided by the final race as Lu, Wilson, and Picon were well ahead of fourth-place Marta Maggetti of Italy.
Picon won the medal race, with Wilson second and Lu third, but it was not enough to knock Lu out of the gold medal spot. Picon took silver and Wilson bronze in the closest medal competition of the Tokyo sailing regatta. De Geus was never a medal factor, finishing fifth. This was the first Olympics for Wilson, but her mother, Penny Way-Wilson, had competed as a windsurfer at the 1992 and 1996 Olympics.

He was then passed by Michael Greis, who had already won the 20 km in Torino, and Polish biathlete Tomasz Sikora. They would finish in that order, with Greis first, sprinting away with 500 metres left, Sikora second, and Bjørndalen third. Greis would add a third Torino gold medal in the relay, and would win this event at the 2007 World Championships.
