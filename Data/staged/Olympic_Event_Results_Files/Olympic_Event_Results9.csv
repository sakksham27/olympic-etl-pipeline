Dibiasi did not disappoint, taking an early lead, holding it through qualifying, and increasing it in the final round for an easy gold medal. Dibiasi would repeat this title in 1972 and 1976 for a three-peat and was considered the greatest platform diver ever, although Greg Louganis would later challenge that assessment.
The silver medal went to Mexican diver Álvaro Gaxiola who had the support of the hometown fans. After his next-to-last dive, he was awarded 16.10 points and the Mexican fans starting booing and whistling, holding up the competition for 20 minutes with their antics. The next diver was American Keith Russell, who was in second place after eight dives, but he had to stand there and wait for the crowd to die down, and then performed his worst dive of the event, which cost him a medal. The bronze medal went to Russell’s teammate Win Young, who had won gold in this event at the 1967 Pan American Games.

Australia came in as the defending champions and the favorites, although one of their riders, Wendy Schaeffer, had broken her leg only two months before the Atlanta Olympics. She was able to ride, however, and would be the highest ranked Australian in the event. Australia got off to a poor start, placing only sixth in the dressage, which was led by the United States, with Great Britain second, New Zealand third, and Canada and Germany in fourth and fifth, respectively. The US team placed only fifth in the endurance phase, however, which was won by Australia who moved into first place overall, with a 61.00 point lead over the Americans, with New Zealand further back in third. Australia was again only sixth in jumping, but their lead was insurmountable, as the United States placed fourth in the jumping, and Australia defended their gold medal comfortably. The US finished second with New Zealand third. Australia would again win this event at Sydney in 2000, with Andrew Hoy competing on all three gold-medal winning teams from 1992-2000.

Trstena advanced to his second consecutive gold medal match, where he faced Japan’s Mitsuru Sato. Sato had been runner-up at the 1986 Worlds and placed third in 1987. He easily defeated Trstena, 13-2, to win the gold medal. Tohuzov won the bronze medal by defeating Hungarian László Bíró even more easily, winning 14-1. Yordanov would win four more World Championships through 1995 but would have to wait until the 1996 Olympics to win his Olympic gold medal.

Together Rego and Ricardo had won the 2003 World Championships. They also won the gold medal in Athina, though it was not without some difficulty. In the semi-finals they were pushed to three sets by the Swiss pair of Patrick Heuscher and Stefan Kobel. But the final was a showcase for their talents, defeating the Spaniards Javier Bosma and Pablo Herrera, 21-16, 21-15. The Spanish team had been seeded only 15th, and this surprising finish was the best yet in beach volleyball by any Europeans.

The favorite, as she had been in every Olympic race she contested, was France’s Jeannie Longo, who was there for the sprint. A powerful rider, her only weakness was that she was not the greatest sprinter, and she was recovering from a crash a month earlier, in which she had broken her hip, and she had little chance against the entire field. Monique Knol of the Netherlands slipped thru at the end to win the gold medal. She would return in 1992 to win the bronze medal in this event at Barcelona, and the two Olympic races are the major palmares of her cycling career.

The other pool was won by Korea’s Jo In-Cheol, the 1997 World Champion, 1996 Olympic bronze medalist, and 1999 World bronze medalist. Jo was favored in the final, but the match went to hantei with Takimoto prevailing by yusei-gachi.

He improved that at the 1984 US Olympic Trials with 1:58.86 and was the clear favorite for gold in the 200 back. In the heats he bettered Naber’s Olympic record, finishing in 1:58.99 and hoped to improve in the final and set another world record. He won quite easily, finishing 1½ seconds ahead of France’s Frédéric Delcourt, but his time was disappointing to him – 2:00.23. Rather than celebrate he pouted on the medal podium, did not smile, and acted like a spoiled child. Not acknowledging them, the pro-American crowd responded with a chorus of boos, and the press went after him. In his post-race interview, he said, “I would have won no matter what. I didn’t feel good but no one can beat me. That’s not vanity or cockiness. I had control of the race al all times, feeling as bad as I did.”
Carey was so harshly criticized that he had to offer a formal apology. A few days later he came back to win the 100 backstroke and this time smiled, and let everyone know he was happy. He would also win a third gold medal in Los Angeles in the medley relay. A few weeks after the Olympics, Sergey Zabolotnov of the Soviet Union broke Carey’s world record at the Friendship Games.

Prior to the Olympics, major discussion ensued when several European clubs would not release their players to compete in the Olympics. After a short summer holiday because of the European Championships, several teams had to compete in the preliminary rounds of the Champions League or UEFA Cup, and required their players to be present. The clubs argued the Olympic tournament was not on the official international calendar, and thus they were not required to release their players, as is common for international tournaments. The International Football Federation (FIFA) meanwhile announced that the tournament had been “informally” on the calendar for years, and clubs would have to oblige. Eventually, the case was taken to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS), which decided in favour of the clubs. Eventually, most players did play in Beijing, although a few were forced to fly back to Europe before completion of the competition.
Two of the affected footballers were the star players of the South American favourites, Lionel Messi (Argentina) and Ronaldinho (Brazil). Both played for Spanish side FC Barcelona, which wanted the players to withdraw. However, Messi was eventually allowed to compete, while Ronaldinho completed a transfer to Italy just before the Olympics. Ronaldinho’s Brazil was looking to finally win the Olympic gold medal that had eluded Brazil for decades, while Argentina was defending its 2004 title, and had won the 2005 and 2007 editions of the U20 World Cup. Other contenders were assumed to be the African sides of Cameroon (the 2000 Champions), Nigeria (gold in 1996) and Italy and the Netherlands from Europe.
Brazil and Argentina were the only teams to qualify for the quarter-finals undefeated. Both needed extra time to win their matches against Cameroon and the Netherlands, respectively, before clashing in the semi-finals. The match was highly anticipated, but turned out to be a fairly one-sided affair, with Argentina beating their neighbours 3-0. Two goals were scored by Sergio Agüero, with his father-in-law (former star player Maradona) watching from the stands. In the other semi-final, Nigeria had little trouble with Belgium, the tournament’s biggest surprise.
In the final, a replay of the 1996 Olympic final in Atlanta, Nigeria and Argentina were evenly matched in the first 45 minutes. In the 58th minute, a quick break from Argentina resulted in the match’s only goal, as Ángel di Maria chipped the ball over the goalkeeper. Nigeria pressed hard in the final half hour, but were unable to pull of the same stunt as in 1996. Argentina thus became the first repeat winners of the Olympic title in 40 years, after Hungary won the title in 1964 and 1968.

Bellutti earned two points on the final lap to secure the gold medal with 19 points. All 17 riders finished on the same lap. Afraid to fall, Van Moorsel was at the back of the pack for most of the race, which impacted her ability to respond to outbreaks and attacks. Van Moorsel herself was quite happy with the medal, not having done any specific training for the event.

The great Josef Holeček of Czechoslovakia had been the most recent World runner-up, but he did not compete in this event and his country sent Alfréd Jindra instead. Jindra led the race for most of the course, but tired in the final stretch and was passed by Havens and Hungarian Gábor Novák, who won gold and silver respectively, leaving the Czechoslovakian with bronze. Havens father Bill had been selected to represent the United States as a rower at the 1924 Summer Olympics, but elected to remain home in order to be with his wife when she gave birth to Frank and never again got the opportunity to compete at the Games. Thus, according to the International Olympic Committee, “[a]fter celebrating his victory, Havens sent his father an emotional telegram that read: ‘I’m bringing home the gold medal that you should have won.’”

That challenge was made tougher because the former GB coach, Mehdi Kordi,  started working with the Netherlands squad in 2019. The Dutch were regarded as Britain’s biggest rivals, having won the team sprint gold medal at the last three UCI World Championships.
The reigning world record holders Netherlands set a new Olympic record 42.134 in qualifying with Team GB second, 0.97 behind, despite being up on their rivals after two or the three laps. The Netherlands trio consisted of Roy van den Berg, Harrie Lavreysen and Matthijs Büchli, while the British trio was made up of Ryan Owens, Jack Carlin, and Jason Kenny.
In their first-round heat Britain beat Germany with a time of 41.829 while Netherlands qualified fastest after beating Poland in another Olympic record 41.431 and, as the two fastest heat winners, Great Britain and Netherlands met for the gold medal while the two slowest, Australia and France went head-to-head for the bronze medal, which the Europeans won by 1.682 seconds. Day two on the track was also a double blow for Jason Kenny and his wife Laura, who both ended up winning silver on the same day.
Despite leading at the end of the first lap, the British trio were beaten by over three seconds as the Dutch trio of van den Berg, Lavreysen, and Jeffrey Hoogland, in for Büchli, won in a yet another Olympic record 41.369. The victory ended an 85-year wait for a male track gold medal for the Netherlands, with Arie Van Vliet being their last champion at Berlin in 1936, and in taking the Olympic title, Netherlands became the first reigning world champions since France in 2000 to also collect Olympic gold. Also, it was the first time the Dutch had won a team sprint medal of any colour.
Jason Kenny became the joint most decorated Briton of all time with his silver medal taking his total to eight, level with fellow cyclist Bradley Wiggins and swimmer Henry Taylor, who won three of his medals at the 1906 Intercalated Games.

The two main roles in the drama were played by a young Swede, Thomas Wassberg, and a Finnish veteran with an impressive collection of silver medals from international championships, the big Juha Mieto, 197 cm tall and weighing around 100 kg. Wassberg started last of the 63 participants, half a minute behind the best Norwegian, Ove Aunli. Mieto, wearing start number 54, started half a minute behind the reigning world champion at the distance, the Pole Józef Łuszczek.
Wassberg started fast, and at the 5 km mark he had caught Aunli and was in the lead, three seconds ahead of Mieto. Łuszczek also had a strong opener, only ten seconds behind the leader, closely followed by a real surprise, the 19-year old West German Jochem Behle and the 30 km winner Nikolay Zimyatov. At 10 km Wassberg had increased his lead to 4.8 seconds. Mieto, still in second place, had almost caught Łuszczek, starting half a minute in front of him, but the Pole was still in third place, now 30 seconds behind the leader. Yevgeny Belyayev had advanced from 11th to fourth., and his teammate Zimyatov was down in sixth place. Aunli had been able to adjust his speed and was on Wassberg’s heels, advancing from 13th to fifth place. Only two seconds separated the four skiers behind Wassberg and Mieto 5 km from home. Young Behle had dropped down to ninth and was out of contention for the medals.
First of the favorites to finish was Zimyatov, looking very fresh at the finish and beating Belyayev’s final time by 12 seconds. But Mieto finished even faster. The Finn had passed Łuszczek, quickly left the Pole behind, and crossed the finish line in 41:57.64, beating Zimyatov’s time by 36 seconds. Could Wassberg respond to Mieto’s finish? The Swede, still skiing together with Aunli, was told 500 m from home that he had a one second lead over Mieto, and, fighting desperately, crossed the finish line in 41:57.63. He had won by the closest possible margin, one hundredth of a second! Aunli secured the bronze medal for Norway, beating Zimyatov by 5 seconds.
Wassberg, then 23, had made his Olympic début in 1976 as a teenager. Before the 1978 World Championships, he was severely injured in a car accident, but fought his way back to the international elite by hard and determined work. Mieto, starting in his third Olympics, ended his career with three individual silver medals in international championships, his 1976 Olympics relay gold medal his only championship victory. In 2007, this extremely popular athlete, who had six wins at Holmenkollen from 1973-1978, was elected a member of the Finnish parliament. At the 1972 Olympics he was involved in another close duel, losing the bronze medal by a margin of 0.06 seconds in the 15 km race. Wassberg proposed to Mieto that they could cut their medals in two parts and then melt them together as a mixed gold-silver medal. Mieto politely thanked him, but said no to the idea, and ended the 1980 season by winning the cross-country World Cup for the second time in a row. The International Skiing Federation (FIS) decided shortly after the 1980 Olympics that all times in cross-country races would henceforth be rounded to the nearest tenth of a second.

But Italy was not one of the six teams in Sydney, having placed fourth at the Olympic Qualifying Tournament. The qualified teams were the host Australians, the top European and American teams from the 1999 World Cup (Netherlands and Canada), the top two from the qualifying tournament (USA and Russia), and the best Asian team from the qualifying tournament (Kazakhstan, which finished sixth).
The round-robin served to eliminate Canada and Kazakhstan, with Australia winning four of five matches and taking first seed into the semi-finals. After the round-robin every match was close and was decided by only one goal. Australia and the United States eliminated Russia and the Netherlands, 7-6 and 6-5, respectively.

The American Minotaur, with George O’Day at the helm, opened up such a large lead that it did not need to start the final race to win the gold medal, but it did, and also won that race. O’Day had won the US Olympic Trials racing on Wistful but that boat was damaged in a collision with a cruiser, so O’Day purchased Minotaur just before leaving for Roma. He was a boat designer who designed 32 different classes of boats, and he was also an assistant helmsman on victorious America’s Cup yachts in 1962 and 1967.
In 15th place the Finnish yacht was helmed by Peter Tallberg, who competed in five Olympics, and became a member of the IOC in July 1976. He also served as President of the International Yacht Racing Union (IYRU) from 1986-94, before it was renamed the International Sailing Federation.

Germany’s Anni Friesinger had won the 2003 and 2004 World Championships, and was runner-up in 2005. The crowd favorite was veteran Chiara Simionato, winner of the first 1000 m at the World Sprints just weeks before the Games. The other 1000 m that weekend had been won by the 500 m Olympic champion and World Sprint champion, Svetlana Boyarkina-Zhurova, although she was not generally considered a 1000 m specialist. From North America, Cindy Klassen and Jennifer Rodriguez were also highly considered, with three Dutch women, Marianne Timmer (1998 Olympic Champion), Barbara de Loor (2005 World Champion) and Ireen Wüst (winner of the 3000 m at Torino), considered as outsiders for a medal.
Not regularly skating the 1000 m, Cindy Klassen was drawn early in the program, lowering Friesinger’s track record from earlier that season to 1:16.09. Fellow Canadian Kristina Groves faced Marianne Timmer a few pairs later. Timmer had been frustrated earlier in the Olympics, having been disqualified for two false starts in the 500 m. She opened out faster than Klassen, and held on to her lead in the last lap, beating the leading time by just 0.04 seconds.
Pair after pair failed to improve Timmer’s time, with 2002 Champion Witty doing no better than 27th, and favourite Simionato placing only 13th. In the last pair, Anni Friesinger seemed headed for the gold, clocking the same split as Klassen, and known for her strong last lap. But Friesinger, too, missed out in the end, finishing at 1:16.11, just behind Klassen to take the bronze.

Esther Shakhamarov was probably stronger in 1972 but withdrew from the event following the murder of the 11 Israeli athletes and coaches, among whom was her coach, Amitzur Shapira.
A major factor in this event was the disqualification of  Lyubov Kononova in the second semi-final which caused the race to be re-run on the morning of the final. Defending champion and world record holder Annelie Ehrhardt qualified for the final first time round but could only finish fifth in the rerun which was won by Tatyana Anisimova. Seventy five minutes later Ansimova was back on track for the final and only missed out on gold to Johanna Schaller by a hundredth of a second.

At six minutes, Uemura used o-uchi-gari to throw Remfrey and then using kuzure-kami-shiho-gatame for the victory.

It had been an Olympic sport since 1988 and had been a demonstration sport at the 1912, 1936, 1956, 1964, 1984, and 1988 Olympics. The tournament was modified with only 6 teams competing in two groups of three. The group play was really a seeding round that advanced all 6 teams to what was effectively a double-elimination round.
Japan and Korea closed down their national professional leagues and brought all their best players to the Olympics. The United States, however, continued with Major League Baseball, and their team mostly consisted of minor leaguers, though a few of them had major league experience.
The final teams were Japan, the United States, Korea, Mexico, the Dominican Republic, and Israel, which represented Europe. Japan and the USA won their groups and met in round two of the tournament, as the other four teams played to advance to the semi-finals, where Korea advanced to meet Japan, who had defeated the USA, 7-6. Japan won that game, 5-2.
Japan defeated the USA in round two, although the United States advanced through the losers’ bracket (termed a repechage by the Organizing Committee), and they met again in the gold medal game. It was closely fought, with Japan taking an early 1-0 lead, but the United States could never score. Starter Masato Morishita shut down the Americans and his relievers held onto the lead. American starter Nick Martinez pitched well, giving up only a third inning home run to Munetaka Murakami.
The Japanese added an insurance run in the eighth, and final Japanese reliever Ryoji Kuribayashi held on for the 2-0 shutout victory and the gold medal. Though there were no Japanese fans at the gold medal game, because of the pandemic, they reveled in the victory as baseball is a national craze in Japan.
The Dominican Republic defeated Korea in the bronze medal match-up, 10-6. With the USA winning the silver medal, American Eddy Alvarez became only the sixth person to win medals in Summer and Winter Olympic sports, as he had won a silver in short-track speedskating in the men’s relay at Sochi in 2014.

In the qualification round, Norwegian sprint specialist Ola Vigen Hattestad was the fastest skier, and proceeded to win both his quarter-final and semi-final heats skiing from the front. The most prominent drop-outs in the earlier rounds were Italy’s Federico Pellegrino, skiathlon gold medallist Dario Cologna from Switzerland and Norway’s 2010 multiple medalist Petter Northug, Jr., who made another disappointing appearance after a virus infection earlier in the year.
In the final, Hattestad followed his usual tactics, leading from an early stage, followed closely by Sweden’s Teodor Peterson. The second Swede, Emil Jönsson was already lagging far behind after an early fall, when three other leading skiers Marcus Hellner, also from Sweden, Norway’s Anders Gløersen, and the Russian home crowd favorite, Sergey Ustyugov were involved in a collision. Gløersen fell on a downhill curve, bringing down with him Ustyugov and Hellner. In the race for gold and silver, Hattestad stayed out of trouble and beat Peterson from the front position by 1.22 sec. Behind them, the already written off Jönsson took advantage of the crashes, and crossed the finish line 20 seconds behind the winner to claim an unexpected bronze.

Nonetheless this duo was considered the favorite, as its strongest challengers at the Worlds had tended to be inconsistent. Burcică and Alupei won their heats in the opening round, as did Germany, the 1997 World Champions and 1998 runners-up, and the United States, the 1999 runners-up. The United States was represented by its 1999 World silver medal-winners, Christine Collins and Sarah Garner, while Germany sent a fresh squad consisting of Valerie Viehoff and Claudia Blasberg. Romania and Germany met in the semi-finals, at which the former triumphed with ease, while the Americans won their own easier heat. In the final, the Germans mounted a surprisingly strong challenge to the Romanians but, in the end, missed out on the gold medal by 0.31 seconds, taking silver instead. The United States was far behind these two, but still over five and a half seconds ahead of its nearest competitors, and thus captured bronze.

There were four vaulters remaining after 4.50 metres (14-9) – Dragila, Russian émigré Tatiana Grigorieva competing for Australia, Icelander Vala Flosadóttir, and Czech Daniela Bártová. Bártová had competed at the Olympics in 1992 as a gymnast but had then turned to pole vaulting. In 1995 she had set nine world records, but George and Dragila had surpassed her. Only Dragila and Grigorieva cleared 4.55 (14-11). Dragila went over 4.60 (15-1) on her first attempt to win the gold. Grigorieva had a miss at 4.60 and then passed to 4.65 (15-3) but could not get over the height and Dragila won the gold medal.

Four members of their lineup, Armin Eichholz, Bahne Rabe, Ansgar Wessling, and Manfred Klein, were veterans of the 1988 tournament. If anyone stood out as a challenger, it was Canada, who had been runner-up at the last two World Championships. In the opening round, however, not only did Romania defeat the Germans, but it did so in Olympic record time. The Canadians and the Americans, meanwhile, won the other two heats. In the semi-finals, the Romanians again posted the fastest finish, this time against the Canadians, while the Germans bested the Americans. The race was close among all the boats for much of the race, but particularly for Canada and Romania, who were neck and neck in first place as they drove towards the finish line. The Canadians had pulled ahead by the 1500 metre mark and they appeared to have clinched victory, but the Romanians put forth an extraordinary effort in the last stretch and nearly caught up to their opponents. The photo finish confirmed, however, that the Canadians had kept Romania at bay just long enough, taking the gold medal in Olympic record time and by a margin of only 0.14 seconds. Germany was not far behind either, capturing bronze 0.33 seconds after the Romanians’ silver.

Yatsynenko did not attend the 1960 Summer Olympics, but the other three were there and contenders for the podium, with Holovachov partnering with Mykolas Rudzinskas. Hungary’s György Mészáros and András Szente were the reigning European champions and were also in contention. All of these pairs, however, would have to face the Swedish duo of Sven-Olov Sjödelius and Gert Fredriksson, the latter of whom was a multiple Olympic and World Champion in other disciplines.
None of these nations, however, won their opening heats, which were taken by Ruud Knuppe and Toon Geurts of the Netherlands, Danish brothers Kai and Vagn Schmidt, and Germans Wolfgang Lange and Dieter Krause. With different crews, Denmark had been the 1957 European runners-up, while Germany had been the 1957 and 1959 European champion and bronze medalist respectively. The semi-finals had results that were more expected, as the heats were taken by Hungary, the Soviet Union, and the Polish duo of Władysław Zieliński and Stefan Kapłaniak. The only major upset was the elimination of Belgium in the first heat, in favor of Hungary, Sweden, and the Netherlands. The final came down to a race to the finish between Sweden and Hungary, which the former won by a margin of only 0.18 seconds, leaving the latter with silver and giving Fredriksson the rare distinction of having earned a gold medal at four consecutive Olympics. He was the first canoeist to accomplish this and his feat was not repeated until 1984, when Ivan Patzaichin  of Romania won his fourth gold medal in the C-2 1000. Poland, meanwhile, took bronze by an ever smaller margin over the Soviet Union: 0.12 seconds.

The world record holder was Pavel Pegov, who set the mark of 36.57 at Medeo in 1983, but he was competing only in the 1,000 in Sarajevo. The 1983 World Sprints had been won by Japan’s Akira Kuroiwa, but he was also only in the 1,000. In the opening pair American Nick Thometz posted 38.56, but he was bested by his pairmate, Fokichev, who finished in 38.19. In that pair, Japan’s Yoshihiro Kitazawa, a complete unknown, finished in 38.30 to move into second place ahead of Thometz. The sixth pair had American Dan Jansen and the 1981 World Sprints champion, Frode Rønning of Norway, and they were considered threats, although Jansen was still young. Jansen narrowly finished ahead of his teammate, Thometz, posting 38.55, but Rønning was disappointing with 38.58. The next pair had Canada’s Gaétan Boucher, who had been second at the 1982 World Sprints. When he finished in 38.39 the medals were decided. There were 14 pairs yet to race, but as the sun warmed the ice, only the early starters could contend. Fokichev was the gold medalist, but had been a complete unknown outside the Soviet Union until recently, having never competed internationally prior to the 1983-84 season. He would turn out to be a fairly good sprinter, winning both 500s at the 1984 and 1987 World Sprints, and posting two World Cup victories over 500 metres.
One unusual competitor in the event was Errol Fraser of the British Virgin Islands. Born in New York, Fraser had dual citizenship and had competed in a few international races training for the Winter Olympics. He was the first Olympian from the British Virgin Islands or any Caribbean nation, and was the first black Olympic speed skater.

In fact, the two nations had such deep world-class runners to choose from that even the make-up of their Olympic marathon teams was hard to pick in the months prior to the Olympics. The race itself was unspectacular. Defending champion Josia Thugwane ran, but finished 20th. Not unexpectedly, three runners from Ethiopia and Kenya mounted the podium.

East Germany, however, had a strong claim as the defending Olympic champion and the nation that had won three of five World Champions and been runners-up twice. Canada and the United States were absent from the event, due to the American-led boycott, which left Romania as the only other World Championship medalist at the Games and a decent candidate for a podium finish.
The Soviet Union had the upper hand in the opening round, winning their heat by a greater margin and with a faster time than the East Germans, who had to contend with Romania while winning their own heat. In the final, these three nations were surprisingly evenly matched through most of the race, although they began to space out as they approached the finish line.

He had won the 1,500 m at the 1951 World Championships and the 1951 and 1952 Europeans. In the international race at Hamar a week prior to the Olympics, he had also claimed the 1,500 m. Not competing in that race was his biggest opponent, Hjalmar Andersen. Andersen was the dominant all-round skater at that time, and had placed second behind Van der Voort during his distance victories. In fact, third place also seemed certain; at the same three championships, the bronze had been taken by Roald Aas, also from Norway.
Andersen was drawn in the first pair, which was considered to be unfavorable, giving Van der Voort the advantage of knowing the Norwegian’s time. Cheered on loudly by Bislett, Andersen clocked 2.20,4 – not his best Bislett time, but ice conditions were not optimal. But track conditions deteriorated as it began to snow after a few more pairs. Van der Voort, skating in pair five, seemed not to mind the weather, opening in the same time as Andersen. His next two laps were somewhat slower, but the Dutchman was known for his strong final lap. As expected, he closed in on the leading time, but not by enough: 2.20,6.
As the snow continued to fall, the other medal hopefuls were unable to approach the leading times. Lassi Parkkinen (Finland) and Carl-Erik Asplund (Sweden), both stranded at seconds behind the top duo. As expected, the “best of the rest” was Roald Aas, who finished a second behind Van der Voort.

That gave Kramer a tough time to beat, but he was never in contention, and he produced a sub-par race with 13:01.02. This left the gold to Bloemen, the first Canadian man to win a speed skating gold since Gaétan Boucher in 1984. His pairmate, Nicola Tumolero, surprisingly finished in third place, although his most notable performance until the Olympics had been winning the inaugural European 5,000 m title in a field without many top skaters. It made him the first Italian to medal in the sport since the Torino Olympics.

Behind her was the next starter Jessica Lindell-Vikarby (SWE) who was 0.52 seconds behind. As skiers struggled with the conditions, Anna Fenninger (AUT) posted a good time of 1:18.73, followed by the young American skier Mikaela Shiffrin with a time of 1:18.79. Defending champion Viktoria Rebensberg (GER) came next, but was some 1.36 seconds off the pace of Maze. Only Nadia Fanchini (ITA) was able to threaten the leader, posting a time of 1:18.53 to finish in third place at the end of the first run.
With the top 30 going in reverse order, Rebensberg was to take the lead, her run of 1:17.90 proving to be the fastest second run, and a combined time of 2:37.14 setting the target. Shiffrin could not improve on this and finished 0.23 seconds behind the leader. However Fenninger was to take over the lead with the third fastest second run, setting a new target of 2:36.94. Fanchini was unable to defeat either of the two leading times and Lindell-Vikarby did not have a good second run, putting her down to seventh place. Going last Maze had a relatively slow run (11th fastest), but had enough in hand over Fenninger to hang on and win her second gold medal by 0.07 seconds.

Six different nations placed in the top six and all also used different skis. Finishing in 55th place Alessia Afi Dipol became the first Alpine skiing competitor for Togo, only five days after Mathilde Amivi Petitjean represented this country for the first time in Winter Olympics. Back in 65th position Elise Pellegrin was the first ever Winter Olympic competitor from Malta and in 67th place was Vanessa Vanakorn, the first Alpine skier from Thailand. She was much better known as Vanessa-Mae, world famous violinist, who was reported to have sold over 10 million albums.

No other team was given much of a chance for gold.
In the end it was more a coronation than a real race. Trotter gave the USA a nice lead on the opener, posting 50.2, with Russia’s Yuliya Gushchina second at 51.0. Felix then ended any suspense with 48.2 on the second leg, the fastest of the race, as Russia trailed by more than two seconds. Francena McCorory had the third leg for the Americans and opened the lead further, giving Sanya Richards-Ross what amounted to a victory lap. She brought it home in 49.10 for a final time of 3:16.87, equal to the fifth fastest time ever. Russia trailed almost four seconds back for silver, with Ukraine getting bronze. Richards-Ross won her second gold medal of the London Olympics, while Felix won her third, including the 4×100 relay the day before. Richards-Ross also won her third consecutive gold medal in the event, emulating Frank Wykoff, who won three relay gold medals for the United States in the 4×100 in 1928-36.
That was how the event and the results seemed to have ended. In 2015, however, the IOC began re-testing samples from the 2008 Beijing and 2012 London Olympics, using newer, more advanced testing techniques, in an effort to find those who had used performance enhancing drugs (PEDs), but in whom it could not be detected at the time of those Olympics. This was one of the many events affected.
In February 2017, Antonina Krivoshapka was revealed to have tested positive for turinabol (dehydrochloromethyltestosterone). Her disqualification led to the Russian relay team losing the silver medal. Jamaica was advanced to the silver medal, and Ukraine received the bronze medal. In early October 2017, another Russian team member, Yuliya Gushchina, also had a re-test positive (substance not announced), and in February 2019, Tatyana Firova was also disqualified for an anti-doping rule violation (ADRV).

Then in 1955, Kuts and Hungary’s Sándor Iharos exchanged the record. Iharos had had a dominating year in 1955 in distance running, setting six world records at distance between 1,500 and 5,000 metres, and in early 1956 set world records at six miles and 10K. The Melbourne 5K was expected to be a great battle between Kuts, Iharos, and Chataway. But shortly before the Olympics, the Soviet Union invaded Hungary to put down a democratic uprising in that country. Although Hungary competed in Melbourne, Iharos stayed back home, unsuccessfully working the telephone exchanges.

All three teams competed but the match between Germany and Great Britain on 21 October did not take place. The reason given was that the British and German teams were not able to stay in Paris for the entire 15 days that would have been required for them to play both matches.
The scoring system in 1900 was a bit different than in previous years, and also different than that used today.  At the 1900 Olympics, a try was worth 3 points, as was a penalty goal. A conversion was worth 2 points and a dropped goal was worth 4 points. This scoring system was apparently devised by Coubertin, a rugby enthusiast and referee. We are indebted to Ian Buchanan (GBR), former ISOH President, who discovered this system and the scoring in the two matches which took place.
Rugby was interesting in that it attracted the biggest crowds of any event at the 1900 Olympics. As many as 6,000 spectators watched the second match of the tournament between France and Great Britain. In addition, the first known black Olympic athlete competed in the 1900 rugby tournament. This was Constantin Henriquez, who was  of Haitian origin, and later became a doctor. A picture of him exists in the German sporting magazine from 1900, Sport im Bild.

The Russians started slow with their women’s single, but Roman Repilov in the men’s single clocked the second best run of the day. Unfortunately, the double couldn’t keep pace and Russia finished seventh.
Latvia was up next, but their singles were not at the level of four years earlier, and even with the Šics-brothers in the double they placed sixth. Italy had a great start with Andrea Vötter in the women’s single, clocking the second best time of the day for the women, but the rest of the team clocked regular times and Italy finished fifth.

By the half-way point of the Olympic cycle that unpredictability had faded away in the knowledge that the nearly crowned World Champion pairing of Dutch rider Edward Gal and Moorlands Totilas would dominate the dressage world for many years to come. Ironically it was their performance in winning three gold medals at the 2010 World Equestrian Games that ruined their chances of Olympic glory. A business consortium led by former German Olympic riders Ann-Kathrin Linsenhoff and Paul Schockemöhle bought Totilas from his Dutch owners for a fee variously reported at between €10-15 million with the intention of mixing his competitive career with lucrative stud duties. Linsenhoff’s stepson Mathias Rath took over the ride from Gal but the pairing never rose to the same level as Totilas’ showing in 2010 and their dreams of Olympic glory faded when Rath was sidelined with mononucleosis (glandular fever) in the spring of 2012.
The mantle of favourite was inherited by Adelinde Cornelissen, a Dutch rider who had won both individual titles at the 2011 European Championships with Britain’s Carl Hester seemingly the main threat to her title challenge. Another British rider, Charlotte Dujardin, had made a huge improvement in partnership with Valegro over the previous 12 months and arrived at the Games with the highest score of the year to date.
Dujardin had only made her international début in the spring of 2011 but took to the Olympic arena like a seasoned veteran and posted the best scores in each of the two qualifying rounds. In the culminating Grand Prix freestyle Cornelissen set an imposing score of 88.196 but, with a routine set to patriotic British music, the theme to the James Bond film “Live and Let Die” and the chimes of Big Ben, Dujardin and Valegro outscored her by two clear percentage points. There was some controversy about the scoring as Valegro had made a clear mistake near the end of his round and afterwards the judges explained that they had favoured the more relaxed “soft hands” riding style of the Briton over the more powerful style of Cornelissen.
Back in 41st place was Japanese rider Hiroshi Hoketsu who at 71-years-old was the oldest Olympian since Austrian fencer Arthur von Pongracz competed at the Berlin Games of 1936. Eight places behind Hoketsu was Morocco’s Yassine Rahmouni who was the first African dressage rider to compete at the Olympics. The Dutch born rider was given a chance to compete at the Olympics when he met King Mohammed VI after jet skiing on his holiday to Morocco. Princess Lalla Amina (president of the Moroccan Equestrian Federation) decided to help him by buying a horse (Floresco) allowing him to compete at the highest level.

Although it would appear that the rest of the world had caught up to the USA in men’s basketball, the USA team at the Athens Worlds consisted of lesser-known pros. The US again chose an NBA All-Star team to represent them in Sydney and it was expected that they would again win easily. Among European teams, there was no consensus favorite to overtake the Americans. At the 1998 Worlds, Russia had won the silver medal, while the podiums had been mounted at the 1997 Europeans by Yugoslavia, Italy and Russia, but in 1999, Italy won the European Championship, with Spain second, and Yugoslavia third. Lithuania had finished no better than fifth at those preliminary international contests.
The US opened the Sydney tournament with two easy wins over China and Italy. But then they faced Lithuania and won by only 85-76. However, the US was undefeated in Group A and went to the quarter-finals, where they handily defeated Russia, 85-70. The semi-finals saw a re-match against Lithuania, and the myth of American basketball dominance would finally end – probably forever.
Lithuania did not win. But with 1:36 left in the game, former University of Maryland player Šarūnas Jasikevičius sank two free throws to give Lithuania an 80-79 lead. The USA responded and pulled ahead 84-81. But Jasikevičius sank a short jump shot with a bit over 9 seconds left, to cut the lead to one point. Lithuania fouled Jason Kidd, who hit one free throw but missed the second. Jasikevičius then came downcourt and launched a 22-foot 3-point attempt, going for the win. It missed, and the USA won, 85-83.
In the final, the US took an early lead against France. But midway thru the second half, France also laughed in the face of American hoops dominance, and cut the lead to four points with just over four minutes. The American team responded, however, and won 85-75, finishing the tournament undefeated and winning another gold medal. But things were no longer the same in international basketball.

He was favored but the US contingent of Fred Newhouse, Herman Frazier, and Maxie Parks would be formidable as always. In the final, Newhouse went to the lead and was three metres ahead by the halfway mark.

She was cheered wildly by the Mexican fans, noting, “The loud cheering was not for me, personally, but for my country.” Duchková was challenged by Soviet Nataliya Kuznetsova-Lobanova, and with Soviet tanks having recently invaded Czechoslovakia, she had no supporters as the crowd favored the teenaged Czech. Duchková would come back in 1972 to earn a silver on platform and also won silver at the inaugural World Aquatics Championships in 1973. Ann Peterson won the bronze medal, at least continuing the US streak of winning medals in this event that reached back to 1924.

The high standard of qualifying set the stage for a dramatic final.
The current world record holder was Poland’s Artur Wojdat, who trained in the USA and had swum 3:48.38 earlier in 1988 at the US Nationals. In the final the early leader was Sweden’s Anders Holmertz followed by American Matt Cetlinski, the 1987 Pan Pacific champion. Cetlinski took the lead at 300 metres, followed by Wojdat and Holmertz, with East German Uwe Daßler in fourth, and Australian Duncan Armstrong, already the winner of the 200 free in Seoul, moving up slightly, but still in seventh. Cetlinski continued to lead at 350 but he was dying, and Wojdat and Daßler moved ahead on the final lap. Armstrong, who swam the final 100 in 55.02, finished very quickly and moved up to the silver medal, passing Wojdat. But he could not catch Daßler, who finished in 55.55 for gold, as Cetlinski dropped off the podium to fourth.
Daßler finished in 3:46.95 to break Wojdat’s world record. But Wojdat also bettered it in third, with 3:47.34, as did Armstrong in second with 3:47.15, and it took a world record time just to get on the podium. Wojdat called it “The Race of the Century,” which was echoed by Terry Stoddard, his Mission Viejo coach, who said “Yes, definitely. It was the greatest race in history.”

Blanik was the 2007 World Champion, and silver medalist in 2005.

His 2011 championship in this event was done in the world record time of 14:34.14. Coming into this event he had already won a gold medal in London in the 400 metres. He qualified easily in this event but then in the final strangely jumped into the water ahead of the signal, but what seemed to be a false start was waved off as due to crowd noise. On the second start he moved into the lead early and was never challenged. At 400 metres he was 1.23 seconds ahead of his world record split from the Shanghai Worlds. At 1,000 metres Sun was over five seconds ahead of Canadian Ryan Cochrane, the 2008 bronze medalist, with the defending champion, Oussama Mellouli, who was fighting off a shoulder injury, moving into third place. Park Tae-Hwan, the Korean gold medalist at 400 metres in 2008, and runner-up in that event to Sun in London, was also close to a medal position.
But the race belonged only to Sun. He did not slow at all, finishing in 14:31.02 to easily better his own world record and win the gold medal by over eight seconds, as Cochrane came in second in 14:39.63, with Mellouli winning a second consecutive medal in the event in 14:40.31. Park had nothing left, and dropped well back of Mellouli, but still finished fourth. Mellouli would come back in a few days and win the 10 km open-water swim, the first ever swimmer to win gold medals both in the pool and open-water. Sun’s win made him the seventh swimmer to win both the 400 and 1,500 metre freestyles at one Games.

In a politically charged match set against the backdrop of the crushing of the Hungarian Uprising by Soviet troops, the Soviet team only narrowly lost to the Hungarians by a 9-7 margin. Hungary’s other matches were more straightforward victories and guaranteed their sixth successive gold medal in the event. Poland took silver after a 9-7 win over the USSR who had to settle for a bronze, the nation’s first ever in fencing.
The victorious Hungarian team broke up immediately after the Games ended.  Aladár Gerevich, Rudolf Kárpáti and Pál Kovács returned to Hungary, continued their fencing careers and all three returned for one final, victorious, appearance at the Rome Olympics. Attila Keresztes, Jenő Hámori and Dániel Magay all fled to the United States and eventually settled there and took up US citizenship. Keresztes and Hámori would return to Olympic competition under the American flag in 1964 at Tokyo.

The 100 metre butterfly was the only race in which he competed in Beijing where he did not hold the current world record. In fact he was not even the fastest American in the field as that honour was held by world record holder Ian Crocker. Despite the presence of Crocker and Serbia’s Milorad Čavić, Phelps’ previous performances at the 2008 Games were such that he was still considered a hot favourite.
The final was a race of two distinct halves. Over the first 50 m Milorad Čavić pulled out a big lead and with Phelps trailing back in seventh it appeared that his ambition to have a perfect Olympics was lost. The final 50 metres saw a monumental effort from Phelps to get back on terms with the Serbian but as both men reached for the wall on their final strokes it appeared Čavić still held a narrow lead. The crowd and media looked up at the scoreboard in anticipation of a Serbian victory but instead it was Phelps’ name that flashed up on the scoreboard as champion. Television replays indicated that Phelps’ final stroke had been timed to perfection whilst Čavić’s finish was a little more sloppy in its execution. It may even have been that whilst Čavić had reached the touchpads before Phelps he had not provided the minimum 3 kgs of pressure required to trigger the mechanism. Some people pointed to the fact that Omega, the official timekeepers to the Olympic movement, were also personal sponsors to the American champion but nobody provided any evidence to support their complaints. A protest was put in by the Serbian team management but it was overruled after a review.

He had also won silver in the K2-1000 at the 2008 Summer Olympics. Equally decorated was Germany’s Max Hoff who, since his bronze medal from the London Games, had been World Champion in 2013, European Champion in 2015, European runner-up in 2013, and European bronze medallist in 2014. Portugal’s Fernando Pimenta, meanwhile, was the 2016 European Champion and the 2015 World and European bronze medallist. He was also a runner-up in the K2-1000 at the 2012 Games. Finally, Josef Dostál of the Czech Republic was the 2014 World Champion and 2015 World Runner up, and the 2013 European bronze medallist.

Pimenta had the fastest time in the preliminaries, although he managed to edge out Hoff by only 0.445 seconds and Marcus Walz of Spain by 0.646 seconds. Poulsen and Dostál also won their heats and while all five survived to the final, none of them won their semifinal. That distinction went to Australia’s Murray Stewart, a 2012 Olympic Champion in the K-4 1000, and Russia’s Roman Anoshkin. This set the stage for an exciting final, which for much of the distance was led by Stewart, who had posted the fastest semifinal time. In the final quarter of the race, however, Walz shot ahead of Stewart in an impressive run that earned him a gold medal. Unable to maintain the pace, Stewart was then passed by Dostál and Anoshkin, who earned silver and bronze respectively, leaving the disappointed Australian in fourth. Dostál would go on to take bronze as part of the Czech Republic’s K-4 1000 team.

The two traded the Olympic record in the heats but Rademacher may have suffered from his participation in the water polo competition and although Tsuruta was always pressurised, he was never headed as he won with a metre to spare. Teófilo Yldefonso of the Phillipines came perilously close to being knocked out of the competition in his heat, qualified for the semi-finals only as a fastest loser but swam an inspired final to gain the very first medal for the Philippines in Olympic history.

He lost the final on decision to Harry Spanjer, while Russell Van Horn took third place. But more than a year later, Egan was discovered to have been fighting under an alias. This was not uncommon at the time, as many more wealthy citizens did not want to be associated with sports. Egan’s real name was Frank Floyd, and he came from Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania. While this may not seem serious, by the rules of the AAU it was illegal to fight under an assumed name, a so-called ringer. In November 1905, the AAU decided that Egan would be disqualified from all AAU competitions, and he would have to return his prizes. The Atlantic Association that had knowingly accepted Floyd’s application as Egan was also expelled from the AAU.
This late decision to revise the Olympic results in this event has, as far as we know, never been published since the events in 1905, and was only rediscovered in 2008 by Taavi Kalju. More than 100 years after the fact, Peter Sturholdt can be recognized as a new Olympic medallist. This is even more remarkable considering he never won a single fight. In the quarter-finals, he was originally listed as having narrowly lost to Carroll Burton. While Burton was a well-known St. Louis fighter, the Olympic boxer was a different person. Like Egan, he had used a false name to compete, but his real identity, James Bollinger, was uncovered after the fight. This moved Sturholdt through to the semi-final by disqualification, where he lost against Egan. He then also lost the match for third place against Van Horn.

Heiden had won the 1977-80 World Sprint championships, but was considered vulnerable because of the short nature of the event, and his best time of 37.80, set at Inzell in 1979, was far from Kulikov’s 37.00 world record.

And at the recent 1980 World Sprints, he had lost one 500 to US teammate Tom Plant, but Plant skated only the 1,500 in Lake Placid.

Kulikov started slightly faster – 10.08 to 10.13, but Heiden crushed him, 38.03 to 38.37. The time was far off Kulikov’s world record but the ice was not considered fast. Kulikov had a slight stumble on the final curve and later claimed it cost him the gold. In the second pair, Norway’s Frode Rønning posted 38.66, showing how quick Heiden’s time had been.

Deburghgraeve’s approach to the final was simple – blast away from the gun and hope to hang on until the finish.

As was traditional in the event, however, there were no guarantees and Kozák had several considerable contenders to deal with in Rio. New Zealand’s Lisa Carrington, for example, had gradually advanced the podium in the Worlds from bronze in 2013 to silver in 2014 to gold in 2015 and had taken gold in the K-1 200 two days earlier. Germany’s Franziska Weber, meanwhile, had been consistent at the European Championships, finishing runner-up in 2014, 2015, and 2016. Finally, Ewelina Wojnarowska was worth noting as the 2015 European Champion.
In the preliminaries, Carrington won the first heat, while Kozák took the second, in which Weber was fourth. China’s Zhou Yu, the 2010 Asian Games Champion and 2015 World bronze medallist, was victorious in the third heat, while Wojnarowska finished behind Inna Osypenko-Radomska, formerly of Ukraine now competing in Azerbaijan, in the fourth. Osypenko-Radomska had taken bronze in the K-1 200 two days earlier, but more importantly was the 2008 Olympic Champion and the 2012 runner-up. Wojnarowska was then eliminated in the semifinals in a difficult heat where Carrington came second behind Marina Litvinchuk of Belarus. Zhou, meanwhile, finished third in a heat won by Kozák, while Weber and Osypenko-Radomska were the qualifiers in the last semifinal. In the final, Kozák had little trouble defending her crown, but the next six competitors were separated by only 0.668 seconds. In the end, the surprise silver medal winner was Denmark’s Emma Jørgensen, the 2016 European bronze medallist, who edged out third-place finisher Carrington by just 0.046 seconds. Carrington nonetheless became the first New Zealand woman to win multiple medals in any sport in a single edition of the Olympics.

Yego took the lead in round one with 88.24, which would remain his best mark and would eventually bring him the silver medal. It was also his only fair throw, as he passed on three other throws, including his final two, the victim of a chronic ankle injury. He would be taken off the field in a wheelchair.
In round two Walcott threw 85.38, his best effort, which was good for bronze. Yego held the lead, despite getting only one mark, into round five, when Röhler, until then in second place with 87.40 from the first round, came through with 90.30 to win gold.

The German pairing of Stefan Krauße and Jan Behrendt entered their fourth Winter Olympics having recently won the European Championships and they carried that form forward to Nagano.
Showing the experience gathered over fourteen seasons of sliding together, they mastered the difficult track. They led after the first run and although the two US pairs were marginally faster on the second run the gap was too big to bridge. This was the fourth medal in successive Olympic Games for the Germans, a feat unmatched in the event’s history and their second Olympic title.

Norway had also been World Champion in 1991 and 1993, with Italy second in 1993. The 1994 relay would take place in and around the Birkerbeineren Stadium and over 150,000 ski-crazy Norwegians came to watch the spectacle, expecting to root their boys on to another gold medal. Italy had different plans. There were 14 teams in the race, but seemingly only Norway and Italy mattered, although Finland would put on a brave struggle and stay with the two leaders for 3½ legs.
On the opening leg, Sture Sivertsen put Norway slightly in the lead with Finland second and Italy third, almost 10 seconds back. But the second runner for Italy was Marco Albarello, who had won a bronze medal in the individual 10 km. Albarello faced Norway’s Vegard Ulvang, a Norwegian ski hero, but one who was struggling in Lillehammer, as it came a few months after the death of his brother in a ski accident. Ulvang, who had missed weeks of training searching for his lost brother, could not match the Italian and at the second exchange, Italy led, with Norway second and Finland third, although only 1.1 seconds separated the leaders. The medals were decided as Russia was in fourth, almost 1½ minutes behind.
The third leg skiers were Thomas Alsgaard for Norway, already winner of the 30 km, Giorgio Vanzetta for Italy, and Jari Räsänen for Finland. Räsänen hadn’t been told that the race was supposed to be between Norway and Italy, as he skied the fastest third leg and put Finland into the lead at the anchor exchange. Italy was second and Norway third, but again, only 1.1 seconds separated the three teams. On the final leg Finland would drop back, unable to keep pace with Bjørn Dæhlie for Norway and Silvio Fauner for Italy. Fauner skied on Dæhlie’s back throughout most of the 10 km leg, refusing to take the lead, even when Dæhlie almost stopped, trying to force Fauner to go ahead, in accord with skiing traditions. But Fauner refused to set the pace, leading Alsgaard to later comment, “We hate them for that.” On the final turn into Birkerbeineren Stadium, Fauner moved just ahead of Dæhlie. The 150,000 Norwegians were screaming, and cowbells were ablazing, but as Dæhlie made his move 100 metres from the line, Fauner matched it and Italy won by 4/10ths of a second in the greatest ever ski race.
It is said that the Italians celebrated for two months over their victory, while all Norway mourned. In 1998, Norway and Italy would go at it again, this time Norway winning by an even closer margin, 2/10ths of a second. In 2002, the result was the same – Norway 1, Italy 2 – with the margin still only 3/10ths of a second. Over three Winter Olympics, the two teams would race 120 kilometres, with the total winning margin less than a second, and Norway ahead in cumulative time by 0.1 seconds. But they had lost the one they really wanted, on their home snow, in their hallowed ski stadium, and it would always hurt. It has been called “The Great Race,” and if you mention just that to a Nordic skiing fan, preferably not a Norwegian, they will know what you mean.

Lambert’s challenge was compromised by a rib injury and he fell in the quarter-finals.
The high point of the competition occurred in the final when Argentina’s Rafael Iglesias produced a punch that knocked out his Swedish opponent in the second round and meant that Argentina would end the evening of the finals as it had started them; with a gold medal performance. After the Games a number of the competitors pursued professional boxing careers, Britain’s Jack Gardner briefly held the European title and Uber Baccilieri became Italian heavyweight title.
One boxer who didn’t appear at the Olympic Games and indeed was prevented by injury from even attempting to qualify for the US team was one Rocco Francis Marchegiano. By the time of the Helsinki Olympics, the renamed Rocky Marciano would be weeks away from beginning his reign as heavyweight champion.

The 2008 Finn class was considered a mixed event but there were 26 sailors, and no women. Eleven races were scheduled but light wind conditions caused one day, and two races, to be cancelled, and the medal race had to be re-started due to the light winds.
Ben Ainslie of Great Britain was the heavy favorite, having won this title in 2004, winning his fifth World title in Finn a few months earlier, and also winning his fifth Gold Cup title earlier in 2008. He took a big lead into the medal race, winning of the first eight races. He led the medal race in very light winds, when it was suspended and later re-started. That mattered little as Ainslie won the medal race anyway, giving him his second straight Olympic Finn title, and third consecutive Olympic gold medal, after winning the Laser in 2000. This made Ainslie the second Olympic sailor to win three consecutive gold medals, after Paul Elvstrøm of Denmark, who won four on one-person dinghy from 1948-60.

When Nurudinov missed the 2015 World Championships with a knee injury, the Kazahk Aleksandr Zaychikov took the World title.  With their main rival Ilyin (the four-time World champion, and originally a double Olympic champion from 2008 and 2012), now banned and officially stripped of both his gold medals due to doping infractions, the competition was between Nurudinov and Zaychikov.

He won the World Cup so comfortably that he could afford to skip the final round for more practice back in Korea.
Tretyakov didn’t even make the start line in PyeongChang. On 22 November 2017 the IOC disqualified him from the 2014 Winter Games, stripped him of his title and imposed on him a lifetime ban from ever competing again at the Olympic Games for his part in the doping scandal that engulfed the Sochi Games.  A week before the PyeongChang Games were due to begin the Court of Arbitration for Sport overturned this decision and returned his Olympic gold to him, citing a lack of evidence against him as an individual.  CAS also removed his ban only for him to be refused a chance to defend his title as he didn’t comply with the regulations needed to perform as an “Olympic Athlete from Russia”.
Yong did not disappoint his fans at the Games. He set a track record on first run then took another quarter of a second off that time at his next attempt. At halfway he led the Russian  Nikita Tregubov by .74 of a second with Martins Dukurs back in third. The Korean continued to be blisteringly fast on the second day of competition and came desperately close to breaking the 50 second barrier on his final run. In the end he had a record-breaking margin of 1.63 seconds and achieved the rare feats of both setting the fastest times on each run and recording the four fastest runs of the entire competition.
Martins Dukurs had looked likely to finish in second place for the third Games in a row but a poor final run saw him slump to fourth place. The beneficiaries were Tregubov, who win the silver in his capacity as an “Olympic Athlete from Russia” and Great Britain’s Dom Parsons who took the bronze. Neither man had ever placed higher at a World Cup event.
Yong was the first competitor from outside Europe and North America to win an Olympic sliding medal, and the first athlete from South Korea to win a Winter Olympic medal in a non-skating event.
North America, which had provided at least one medallist at every previous Winter Olympic men’s skeleton had a poor Games and failed to place anyone inside the top 10.
In anticipation of 2022 there was a first Olympic entrant from China and both Israel and Jamaica were present in the event for the first time. Also making headlines in PyeongChang was the Dutch based former sprinter Akwasi Frimpong who became the first African to contest an Olympic skeleton race.

It was quite amazing that the jury gave the gold medal to the community work of the three Parisian architects Gustave Saacké, Pierre Bailly and Pierre Montenot with their plan for a Cirque pour Toros, when one considers that a bullring has no significant connection to the Olympics Games.

But the Norwegians weren’t the only favorites, with Sweden fielding World Record holder Åke Seyffarth and Göthe Hedlund, and Finland entering 1947 World Champion Lassi Parkkinen, who also won 5,000 at that occasion.
Weather conditions were far less favorable than a day earlier. Throughout the 20-pair competition the wind changed regularly, accompanied varyingly by snow and sun. The race, originally set for a 1030 start was rescheduled to 0845, a change that was not announced to all spectators. The first surprise of the race was the fall of 1936 1,500 m champion Charles Mathiesen, who was out of shape and retired. After Dutchmen Jan Langedijk and Kees Broekman both went below 8.40, Hedlund went off for a very fast start. He slowed considerably during the last laps, but lowered the top mark to 8.34,8.
The most interesting pair of the competition was that between Lundberg and Harry Jansson (Sweden). Like Hedlund, Jansson went off quick, with Lundberg trailing for most of the race. At three laps, the Norwegian took command and also built up a lead on Hedlund, finishing after 8.32,7. Jansson, who had been slower than Hedlund for the entire race came very close to beating his compatriot, finished quickly and missed out by only one tenth of a second. In the 14th pair, Seyffarth was hoped to join his compatriots in the top-3, but he failed. This was partially due to a brush with a photographer, who had stepped onto the ice. In the next heat, Reidar Liaklev skated a very steady race. Lapping his Swiss opponent Heinz Hugelshofer, he improved on Lundberg’s mark with 8.29,4. The only contender left was Lassi Parkkinen, but his chances were ruined by heavy snowfall start right after Liaklev’s pair.

The story of the early stages was the elimination of Oh by the Finnish super-veteran Mira Potkonen.

After the tumult that followed the 200 metre victory ceremony, in which Tommie Smith and John Carlos, were expelled from the Olympics by the US Olympic Committee, Evans wanted to withdraw from the final. But Smith and Carlos convinced Evans to run – they were college teammates at San Jose State. Evans started quickly in the final and expected to have a lead coming to the homestraight. But he was worried when he saw that James was right on his shoulder. He pulled away slightly, but James then closed to only a metre back at the finish, as both lowered the world record with Evans finishing in 43.86 and James in 43.97 – the first time anyone had run under 44 seconds for 400 metres. Freeman completed the US sweep.
Evans’ time was officially 43.8, as the official times were only to the tenth of a second in 1968. His automatic time in 1968 was 43.79, but the 1968 automatic times had a built-in 0.05 second delay to allow for response time. This no longer is used, making his actual time 43.84. However, in the early 1970s when the IAAF starting using 1/100ths times for record purposes, they redefined the torso (when crossing the line) to not include the neck, which made Evans’ time 43.86 after re-reading the photo finish timer. The mark lasted as a world record until 1988 when Butch Reynolds ran 43.29 at the Weltklasse in Zürich.

Germany was the defending Olympic Champion, while Hungary was second in 1928. But Hungary had been European Champion in 1926, 1927, and 1931, and was favored in LA. The gold medal came down to the match between the two favorites, with Hungary winning the match, 6-2, and going undefeated in the round-robin to win gold. Germany and the United States tied with 2 wins, 1 tie, and 1 loss, but Germany was awarded the silver on goal differential. From 1932-64, Hungary would win water polo gold in five of seven Olympic Games.
Brazil lost its first two matches, the second 7-3 against Germany. After the match the players attacked the Hungarian referee, Béla Komjadi, which had to be broken up by the police. Brazil was suspended and forfeited their final two games.
United States’ player Phil Daubenspeck scored 14 goals during the tournament, which stood as an Olympic water polo record for one Games until 1968, when the Netherlands’ Nico van der Voet scored 33 goals in Mexico City.

The semi-finals saw world champion Tony Yoka of France edge the hard punching Croatian Filip Hrgović in a close fight, whilst European Games winner Joe Joyce defeated Asian Games gold medallist Ivan Dychko in a similarly tight decision.
Yoka and Joyce had a shared history. The British fighter had defeated Yoka at the European Games in 2015 but the Frenchman had turned the tables on Joyce later in the year at the World Championships.
Their third meeting at a major event was another close encounter. Yoka’s left jab being effective throughout the fight but Joyce landing the harder punches especially in the last round. One judge saw all three rounds for Yoka; another had Joyce 29-29 with the Ukrainian judge splitting the tie in favour of the Frenchman. This was the first French medal in the heaviest weight category for 96 years.
Yoka was engaged to be married to women’s middleweight champion Estelle Mossely. In March 2017 the couple announced they were expecting their first child. Joyce has a degree in fine arts from Middlesex University and is an accomplished painter.

Best nine of eleven scores to count for final placement.,na,"The Laser class was designed in 1970 by Canadians Bruce Kirby and Ian Bruce, who designed it as a “car-topped” dinghy, meaning one small enough that it could be transported on top of a car. In 1996 it was chosen for a mixed one-person dinghy event, although there were also one-person dinghy events for men (Finn) and women (Europe). There were 56 sailors in the class, but no women competed.
After 10 races Brazil’s Robert Scheidt had a slight lead on Britain’s Ben Ainslie, but the gold and silver were not yet fully decided. There were four false starts in the final race so the officials raised the black flag, meaning that any further false start would lead to a premature start and disqualification. On the fifth start Scheidt raced aggressively for the line and Ainslie had to follow. They both crossed the line early and were disqualified, giving Scheidt the gold medal.
The silver medal would not occur again for Ainslie. He won gold in this class in 2000 and then switched to Finn and won three consecutive golds in 2004, 2008, and 2012, making him only the second sailor to win four Olympic golds, after Denmark’s Paul Elvstrøm, who four straight golds in one-person dinghy from 1948-60.
The rivalry between Ainslie and Scheidt is one of the best ever at the Olympics, and in sailing. Scheidt won the silver medal in 2000 behind Ainslie, but won the Laser gold again in 2004 when Ainslie raced in the Finn class. By 2008 Scheidt had switched to the Star class, winning a silver medal that year and a bronze in 2012. Through 2014, Ainslie had also won eight World Championships but he was topped by Scheidt, who could claim 12. After the 2012 Olympics, both had five Olympic sailing medals, a record only matched by Scheidt’s countryman Torben Grael, who also raced at Savannah in 1996, winning gold in the Star class.

They were ousted by West Germany (only 9th at the Worlds) on goal difference.
The tournament rules put a strong emphasis on the pool stage of the competition: only the winners of each pool advanced to the next round, with no elimination rounds. In the first pool, three teams finished equal on points: USSR, West Germany and Yugoslavia. Yugoslavia had defeated the Soviets (20-18), but lost to the West Germans (18-17), who in turn had lost to the USSR (18-16). Yugoslavia’s loss in the final group match came as a surprise to the reigning Olympic champions, but they played without focus and shot poorly - missing the Olympic final by just one goal. This put the matter down to goal difference. That meant the advantage went to the Soviet Union, which had demolished Canada 25-9 and Japan 26-16, while the other teams had scored more modest victories against these teams. In the other pool, Romania was clearly standing out, winning three matches while drawing one (the Match against Tunisia was cancelled as they withdrew due to the African boycott).
The Romanians were clear favorites to win the final, being the four time World Champions, while the Soviets’ best performance had been a fourth place in 1967. But the Soviet squad managed to eliminate playmaker Cristian Gaţu very well, while limiting Ştefan Birtalan, who had averaged almost six goals a game to )only) three scores. After 20 minutes, it was 8-3, already, which translated to a half-time score of 10-6. The second half was more evenly matched, but the final result was never much in doubt: 19-15.

To date, no female Egyptian had ever won a gold medal at the Olympic games, but they had high hopes for Feryal Abdelaziz, who was ranked #2 in the world at the under 68 kg category. World ranked #1 in that category was Iryna Zaretska (AZE).
Zaretska won pool A, although she suffered a narrow defeat to runner-up Sofya Berultseva (KAZ) by a score of 5-4. Berultseva actually drew her first contest with Meltem Hocaoglu Akyol (TUR) and lost her final contest when already assured of progressing to the semi-finals. Pool B had a close outcome with Abdelaziz, Li Gong (CHN) and Elena Quirici (SUI) all winning two and drawing one contest each, so finishing level. Total number of points scored in all contests was the determining factor, which placed Quirici third in the group.
The first semi-final saw a comfortable win for Zaretska over Gong by a score of 7-2, although it was only in the final 15 seconds that Zaretska scored heavily (a yuko and ippon). The second semi-final was a much closer affair, Abdelaziz ultimately winning by 5-4 against Berultseva. All points were scored by yukos, with Abdelaziz taking an early lead and holding on to win.
The gold medal contest was a close match, with no scoring in the first two minutes. In the final minute of the contest, however, Abdelaziz scored two yukos without reply from Zaretska, to become the first female athlete from Egypt to win a gold medal.

There was only one favorite and it was Lindsey Vonn. She was the reigning world champion in Super G, won the Super G World Cup in 2008-09 and led in 2009-10 (only one race left) by winning the last three Super G’s before the Olympics, and showed top form by winning the gold medal in the downhill back on Wednesday and also winning the downhill of the Super Combined a few days before. Julia Mancuso, after winning two silver medals (downhill and combined), and Maria Riesch, after winning the gold medal in the combined, had to be considered contenders. Riesch also won the Super G on 23 February 2008 which was held as part of the World Cup Super Combined on this course. Still a question mark was the remarkable Anja Pärson (2007 World Champion) after her bad crash in the downhill. The medalists from 2006 Michaela Dorfmeister (gold) and Janica Kostelić (silver) both retired shortly after Torino while Alexandra Meissnitzer (bronze) retired in 2008, but Meissnitzer followed the race as an expert for Austrian television and raced the course before the event with a camera.
The race was held under perfect sunny and warm weather with temperatures between 3° (start) and 6° (finish) and was opened by Julia Mancuso at 10:00 AM. She had a comfortable lead by more than seven tenth of a seconds, but did not ski well through “Frog’s Bank”, when Maria Riesch started. Riesch started slowly but finished strong to take the lead, moving Mancuso into second. It looked like a very close race, when the first of the top group Elisabeth Görgl, winner of a World Cup Super G earlier in the season, started. On her 29th birthday, Görgl had bad luck at the start, when she was not able to catch her left pole and lost a tenth of a second on the flat start. But Görgl skied well and when she crossed the finish line she took the lead, 0.32 seconds in front of Riesch. With bib number 17 Lindsey Vonn started and, as expected, led at all splits and took the lead by 0.26 seconds. But it would not last long. Andrea Fischbacher (third in the Super G World Cup in 2008-09 and bronze medalist at the 2009 World Championships) with number 19 sped down the course and took the lead by 0.74 seconds at the finish. Pärson with start number 21 did not contend for a medal so Tina Maze was the last of the top group. She skied a great race which brought her silver, 0.25 seconds in front of Vonn.
Fischbacher, who finished fourth in Wednesday’s downhill, won the first Alpine skiing gold medal for Austria at the Vancouver Games by using downhill skis. Although a bit of a surprise, she had finished second to Vonn in the last World Cup Super G prior the Games. Fischbacher won with Atomic, Maze won the first medal for Stöckli with silver, and Vonn earned the seventh medal at this Olympics for Head skis.

The consecutive game streak ended when a Chinese team defeated them in a preliminary game at the Superball Classic.  The Olympic tournament came down to the same two teams, China facing the United States for the gold medal.  The USA won, 3-1, but not without controversy.  In the 3rd inning, the Chinese tried a double steal with runners on 1st and 3rd.  The umpire called Zhang Chunfang out at home plate, though the call was very close.  In the bottom of the inning, shortstop Dot Richardson hit a two-run homer that sliced down the right-field line.

The other Chinese swimmer, Liu Zige, was a relative unknown having missed the 2007 World Championship after having made little impression in 2005. However Liu had a secret weapon – the training plan that Schipper had used to make her mark in the event. To the consternation of the Australian swimming authorities Schipper’s coach, Ken Wood, had sold the document to the coaches of the Chinese swimmer. It was a move that led to Schipper dropping Wood as her coach following the Olympics.
Liu broke her personal best time in heat and semi-final and then broke Schipper’s record by posting a time of 2:04.18 to win the gold medal ahead of compatriot Jiao with the Australian, who had led to the 150 metre mark, fading badly but still holding onto third.

As reigning World Champions, Australians Megan Still and Kate Slatter were probably the favorites, although they were certain to face a strong challenge from France’s Christine Gossé and Hélène Cortin, the 1993 and 1994 World Champions. In fact, Gossé had come in third at the 1995 edition only in Cortin’s absence. The United States, the reigning Pan American champion, brought its 1995 World runners-up Missy Schwen and Karen Kraft to Atlanta. The only other nation to have won a World Championship medal in the last three years, Romania, sent sisters Liliana and Angela Cazac.
The Australians got off to a strong start in the opening round by posting the fastest time, while France and the United States won the other two heats. The United States, however, mounted a serious challenge in the semi-finals and overtook the Australians to win their heat, while France coasted to an easier victory in its heat and Romania was eliminated. It might have seemed that the Australians were merely conserving their strength but, in the final, they went head to head against the Americans. Although they won gold in Olympic record time, they did so by only a 0.39 second margin of victory. The United States thus took silver and France, who had the only crew anywhere near the two front runners, captured bronze.

The only other nation that came anywhere close to matching Britain’s prowess in the discipline, Canada, did not enter a team. In the opening round, however, the Britons had the second-slowest time (although they still won their heat) as they conserved their strength against a weak French crew. Meanwhile the Americans, Ernest Bayer, George Healis, Charles Karle, and Bill Miller, were at least four seconds faster than anyone else. In the quarterfinals, the Britons were barely able to stave off the Germans, while the Americans essentially had a walkover when France failed to show up for their race. In the semifinals, however, it was Great Britain that got to rest, while the Americans fought off the Italians who, by virtue of having no one left to compete against, earned a bronze medal. In the final the United States put forth a strong effort, but was unable to match the advantage of Great Britain’s strength reserve: the British crew defended their crown in the last stretch of the course, while the Americans settled for silver. The Italians, who had been 1927 European Champions with a different crew, would go on to defend that crown in 1929 and 1930 with their Olympic quartet.

What should have been a strong French challenge from Pervis and teammate Michaël D’Almeida fizzled out early but both Kenny and Eilers clinched their expected places in the final.
The final was a logistical disaster.  At the first attempt the race was halted when Kenny appeared to have overtaken the back wheel of the derny before it left the track but, after a delay of several minutes, he was allowed to continue in the event when video footage from a Team GB data analyst sitting in the stands was used to clear Kenny of any guilt. Amazingly no official camera was set up to judge this type of infraction. The second attempt saw an identical incident, and again the race was aborted with Eilers appearing to be the guilty party. Once again though it proved impossible to determine that any rule had been broken. By now the event was causing havoc with TV schedules and in Britain, where the exploits of Kenny and his fiancée Laura Trott were dominating newspaper front pages, the main evening news was delayed by 70 minutes to allow live coverage of the race.
Eventually, at the third attempt, the race was finally completed. Eilers and Damian Zieliński of Poland sprinted early and held a clear lead with a lap to go, but both faded and Kenny swooped around the outside to win his third gold medal of the 2016 Olympics and the sixth of his career. Matthijs Büchli of the Netherlands placed second while Mohd Azizulhasni Awang made a late lunge at the line to win Malaysia’s first ever Olympic cycling medal.
With six gold and a silver Kenny equalled exactly the tally of former teammate Chris Hoy and became the joint most successful British Olympian ever, at the age of only 28. His victory meant Great Britain had won three successive titles in the event each with a different rider.

The event was also conducted at the 1st World Athletics Championships in 1983, but 1984 was the first time the event was included on the Olympic Program. The East Germans and Soviets had dominated this event to date and their absence in 1984 made the event wide open. The surprise winner was Morocco’s Nawal El-Moutawakel. By winning, she became the first Muslim woman and the first woman from an Islamic nation to win a medal at the Olympics. Although she at first was a hero to the Moroccan people, with celebrations in the streets of Casablanca on the night of her victory, she later was subjected to criticism and intimidation by Islamic fundamentalists.

The other semi saw van Vliet against the 1932 silver medalist, Louis Chaillot of France. In the first race of the final, Merkens led on the last curve, but van Vliet was about to pass him, when Merkens rode him up the bank in a blatant foul. Van Vliet raised his hand in protest and the jury deliberated. But the second race went on before a decision was announced, and it was also won by Merkens. The Dutch team then protested to the Jury of Appeal, but they confirmed the earlier verdict. In an unusual ruling, to say the least, Merkens was not disqualified in the first race, but instead was fined 100 Reichsmarks. While this not uncommon in professional racing, it was unheard of among the amateurs. Merkens turned professional only a few days after the Olympic races ended. Later in 1936 Van Vliet won the amateur World Championships, and would later win three professional sprint titles – 1938, 1948, and 1953 – and placed second as late as 1957.

World champions Denmark, who had set a new world record in qualifying the previous day, were up against Great Britain in their first round heat, but the Danes easily caught the British four. But just as he got within a wheel of Britain’s third rider, Charlie Tanfield, in for the injured Ed Clancy, was hit from behind by Frederik Madsen and both men crashed to the boards. Neither team finished with three riders (times were taken on the wheel of the third rider of each team), but it was adjudged on appeal that Britain had been caught, which was the purpose of the pursuit. Denmark were winners and through to the final, while Britain had to race for the 7th/8th position, a rare occurrence for them.
Without Alexander Porter, whose handlebars mysteriously came off his bike during qualification, Australia beat New Zealand after overtaking them in the bronze medal race. New Zealand went home without a medal in the knowledge that their time of 3:42.397 in the heat against Italy was the second fastest time of the entire competition.
Predictably, Italy won the gold in yet another world record, 3:42.03, beating Denmark by 0.166. The Italians led for the first 2000 metres but the Danes took the lead at the three-quarter stage and still led at the bell before narrowly losing gold. It was Italy’s first team pursuit medal since bronze at Mexico in 1968 and their first gold since winning on “home soil” in 1960.
After their defeat by Denmark, Clancy announced his retirement and pulled out of all remaining 2020 Tokyo events, not wanting to aggravate a back injury. He left the Olympic arena with three Olympic team pursuit golds and an omnium bronze medal to his name, as well as six world golds.

The world record holder was Hans van Helden who had recorded 7:07.82 at Davos in January 1976. Van Helden went off in the second pair and came across in 7:26.54 to take the lead. But it would not last long as Stensen was up next, helped by skating right after an ice preparation, and he went out much faster than Van Helden’s pace, and maintained it, finishing in 7:24.48, a time that would bring him the gold medal. The silver went to Dutchman Piet Kleine, who never challenged Stensen, and was behind Van Helden most of the way, only to finish with a faster lap for 7:26.47.
Hans van Helden had one of the longest international careers of any skater. He appeared at the 1973 European Championships and competed at the 1988 World Championships. He won many distance titles, and the 1976 and 1977 Dutch All-around titles, but never won a major international all-around. Stensen was near the end of his career.

Furthermore, only Australia was represented by a World Championship-winning crew, 2007 victors Marguerite Houston and Amber Halliday. Germany sent 2005 World Champion Marie-Louise Dräger,who was joined by Berit Carow, while China’s 2006 World Champion, Xu Dongxiang, made an appearance for the host nation with Yu Hua. Greece’s Khrysa Biskitzi and Alexandra Tsiavou, meanwhile, had won the event at the European Championships when it was resurrected in 2007, while Cuba’s Yaima Velázquez and Ismaray Marrero were the reigning Pan American champions.
Two of the opening heats were won by China and Germany, but it was the Netherlands’ Kirsten van der Kolk and Marit van Eupen, the 2004 Olympic bronze medalists, who posted the fastest time. Following the 2004 Games, this duo had had internal struggles relating to their different training attitudes and broke up, with Van der Kolk quitting the sport and Van Eupen going on to win the women’s lightweight single sculls at the 2005, 2006, and 2007 World Championships. In 2007, however, they reunited to compete in Beijing. Both Cuba and Australia were eliminated in the semi-finals, in heats won by the Netherlands and the Canadian duo of Melanie Kok and Tracy Cameron. Canada had been the 2007 Pan American Games bronze medalist, albeit with a different crew. In the final, Germany, Canada, and the Finnish duo of Sanna Stén and Minna Nieminen were neck and neck for the first half of the course, but Finland pulled ahead while Germany and Canada slowly fell back and were passed by the Netherlands. Even Finland eventually succumbed to the drive of the Dutch crew, however, and surrendered the gold medal to van der Kolk and van Eupen. Thus Stén and Nieminen, the 2007 World runners-up and 2005 bronze medalists, took silver, Finland’s first Olympic rowing medal since Pertti Karppinen had won the men’s single sculls three consecutive times from 1976 through 1984.

The reigning World Champion, however, was France’s Jordan Sarrou. Mathieu van der Poel of the Netherlands had been the European Champion from 2017 through 2019, while the most recent European Champion, Belgium’s Eli Iserbyt, was not in Tokyo. Van der Poel was an interesting entry, as he was best known for his dominance in cyclo-cross, having won the last three editions of the World Championships (2019-2021), as well as the 2015 title, and had additional successes on the road, yet he elected to concentrate on mountain biking for the Olympics. Also in contention was Mathias Flückiger of Switzerland, the most recent World runner-up. The qualification for the event was completed prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, and thus was not impacted by the delay of the Tokyo Games.
Van der Poel fell early in the race, eliminating him from contention, which allowed outside favorite Tom Pidcock of Great Britain to take control of the race. Pidcock was better known for his success in cyclo-cross, and had sustained a fractured collarbone after being hit by a car earlier in the year, but, after following the two Swiss favorites for a brief period, he launched an early attack and, by lap four, was comfortably in the lead. By the final lap, the first two podium spots had already been decided, with Pidcock finishing 20 seconds ahead of Flückiger.
The thrilling conclusion, therefore, was in the race for bronze, with Schurter attempting to hold on against New Zealand’s Anton Cooper, France’s Victor Koretzky, and Spain’s David Valero. In the end, Valero finished comfortably ahead of Schurter, who had to settle for fourth place, and the rest of the pack. A 2016 Olympian, Valero had few notable results prior to Tokyo and was somewhat of a surprise as bronze medallist.

Not to be counted out was Australia’s Jessica Fox, who had been more successful in the non-Olympic Women’s C-1 Slalom, but nonetheless was the 2012 Olympic runner-up and the 2014 World Champion in the K-1.
The preliminary heats were won by Italy’s Stefanie Horn, the 2013 European runner-up, with Fox in a close second and Fiona Pennie of Great Britain, the 2013 European champion and 2006 and 2014 World runner-up, in third. Austria’s Corinna Kuhnle, the 2010 and 2011 World Champion and 2010 European runner-up, captured the semifinals, with Pennie in second and Maialen Chourraut of Spain in third.

Manrique Larduet, the Cuban bronze medallist at the 2015 World Championship, was also back in action after appearing on the parallel bars, as was Ukraine’s Oleh Verniaiev who was hoping to win his second gold medal of the day.
The first to go was the favourite Hambüchen and he lived up to that billing with a 15.766 from a difficulty rating of 7.300. Zonderland’s performance turned into a disaster when he lost his grip attempting a difficult combination and crashed to the floor face down, leaving him a defeated champion. He got back on the bars but finished seventh. Britain’s Nile Wilson moved into second place with 15.466 and the second US gymnast, Sam Mikulak, moved into third behind Hambüchen and Wilson with a 15.400. Verniaiev could not get among the medals this time and finished last, and it was not until the last man up, Danell Leyva, that the medal positions changed, as he ousted his fellow American Mikaluk from a medal and moved himself into second place with 15.500 to take his second silver within a couple of hours. It was Hambüchen’s first gold in four Olympics and it added to his bronze in 2008 and silver in 2012.

The favorite in Tokyo was likely the Canadian Damian Warner, who had won the invitational Götzis Meeting earlier in 2021, just missing the 9,000 barrier as he scored 8,995 to win.
Warner left no doubt of his intentions in the first phases, running 10.12 in the 100 metres to equal the all-time decathlon best, which he held, and then jumped 8.24 in the long jump, a mark that would have won bronze in the open long jump in Tokyo. He had a comfortable lead, as Mayer had run only 10.68 and Kaul was injured and would not finish.
Warner finished the first day with 4,722 points, leading Australia’s Ashley Moloney by 81 points, with Canadian Pierce LePage in third. Mayer was in fifth, but trailing Warner by almost 400 points.
On the second day, Warner opened with 13.46 in the high hurdles, extending his lead. He then threw 48.67 in the discus, and the gold seemed secure, as long he could clear a height in the pole vault. He did so, recording 4.90 to equal his PR and led by 221 points. Mayer won the vault with 5.20 to move closer to the podium. Behind Warner the battle for medals was between Moloney, Mayer, LePage, and American Garrett Scantling. Mayer improved his position, moving into second after the javelin, in which he threw a PR of 73.09.
The gold was settled as the 1,500 started but the fight for the medals was furious. Moloney needed to beat Mayer by 11 seconds to take silver, but he was not a strong 1,500 runner, and it was not certain he could stay ahead of Scantling for bronze. Moloney was paced by his teammate Cedric Dubler and Moloney ran a PR 4:39.19 to secure bronze as Mayer held on for his second consecutive silver medal, and Scantling finished in the dreaded fourth position.
Warner needed to run under 4:34 to reach 9,000 points, much faster than he had run in May at Götzis, but he did it, recording 4:31.08 to get to 9,018 points and the gold medal.

The story of the 2008 men’s handball competition was that of a country of only 320,000 inhabitants. Despite its size, Iceland had been a handball nation since the 1950s, although they had never medalled internationally. At the 1992 Olympics, they had come closest, losing the bronze medal match to France. At the 2012 Olympics, their pool stage performance was a mixed bag: wins against Russia and World Champion Germany, but also ties to Denmark and Egypt, and a loss to South Korea. In the incredibly tight pool rankings, this placed them third, while the Germans were out. Iceland played Poland in the quarter-finals. Poland had been the runner-up at the 2007 World Championships, and had beaten Iceland at the Olympic Qualifying Tournament. But the Icelanders’ tough defense and accurate fast-breaks put them in a 5-goal lead at half-time, from which the Poles never recovered.
In the semi-finals, Spain awaited. Having twice medalled at the Olympics, Spain had claimed the 2005 world title. But as against Poland, the Icelanders dominated and eventually easily won 36-30 to earn their first ever spot in a major international final. Hoping to claim the nation’s first ever gold medal, Iceland faced France in the final. The country’s president Ólafur Ragnar Grímsson, who called it the “biggest moment in Icelandic sports history”, was in attendance at the National Indoor Stadium, while most of the country came to a halt to watch the game on television. But the French, who had been favored for the gold back in Athens 2004, opened up a four goal lead, supported by their strong goalkeeper Thierry Omeyer. In the second half France, even increased its lead to a huge 9 points, but the match eventually ended in a 28-23 victory for the French. As with Iceland, it was France’s first ever Olympic medal in handball. In the match for bronze, defending champions Croatia failed to medal, losing 35-29 to Spain.

Originally scheduled for 12 February, the race was postponed to the 15th due to strong winds, which would have made the giant slalom follow the slalom, originally scheduled for the 14th, but the slalom was also postponed.
The giant slalom World Cup season saw Viktoria Rebensburg, the bronze medalist from Sochi and silver medalist at the 2015 World Championships, in the lead. She was followed by Tessa Worley, who won the last race before the Olympics in Lenzerheide and was also the giant slalom Crystal Globe winner from the last season (2016/17) as well as the reigning World Champion. In third place was the runner-up in giant slalom at the 2017 World Championships, Mikaela Shiffrin. Considered contenders were Federica Brignone, who already won one race this season, and Ragnhild Mowinckel. The gold medalist from Sochi, Tina Maze, had already retired, while the silver medalist Anna Veith, who won the giant slalom World Cup in 2013/14 and 2014/15 and was also the 2015 World Champion, was returning after surgeries on both knees. The 2015/16 World Cup champion Eva-Maria Brem failed to qualify for the Games after breaking her left tibia and fibula in a November 2016 crash.
The race started under sunny, but cold conditions, -9° C. at the start. Manuela Mölgg led off and surprisingly no one was able to beat her time of 1:10.62. Next to her was Shiffrin in second, Brignone in third and Mowinckel in fourth position with the first nine athletes within a second. Rebensburg was only in eighth and Worley down in 14th, a full 1.42 seconds behind Mölgg. In the second run Estelle Alphand, who started early, set the fastest run time with Worley only 1/100th of a second behind, but neither got near the medals because of their weak first runs. The win went to the world’s dominant skier, Mikaela Shiffrin, with Mowickel in second and Brignone in third. The leader after the first run, Mölgg, who never won a World Cup race, dropped down to eighth place.
Mowinckel also made history in becoming the first ever Norwegian woman to win a medal in giant slalom, which was only the second Alpine skiing medal for Norwegian women after a bronze medal won in combined by Laila Schou Nilsen, back in 1936. In 48th place was Mialitiana Clerc of Madagascar, who became the first ever female Alpine skier from her country. Finishing in 56th place, Arabella Ng was the first ever Alpine skier from Hong Kong, while Kenyan Sabrina Simader was not able to finish the race, but was the first Alpine skier from her country. Shiffrin won the race on Atomic skis, Mowinckel used Head, Brignone skied on Rossignol, Rebensburg used Stöckli, and Bassino in fifth was on Salomon, with the first five finishers using different skis.

But a huge upset occurred in the first round, when unknown American Leo White defeated Van de Walle. In fact, it was such an upset that the referee mistakenly raised the Belgian’s hand before correcting his error. As White had little chance to make the final, and did not, this eliminated Van de Walle from medal contention. Eventually the final came down to two surprising judoka – Brazil’s Douglas Vieira and Korean Ha Hyeong-Ju, who had been bronze medalist at the 1981 World Championships.

She had also won the event at the 1991, 1992 and 1993 World Championships (when she also won the allround world title), and six times in a row at the European Championships from 1989 through 1994. Having skated 4.12 at the World Cup and European Championships (both held in Hamar), it was thought she might even approach the world record.
But things turned out differently. Skating in the third pair, Gunda Niemann stepped on a lane marker and fell after about 430 m. Taking her opponent Seiko Hashimoto with her, Niemann got up quickly and continued her race. But in the confusion, she continued in the wrong lane, for which she was eventually disqualified. With Niemann gone, this left Olympic gold up for grabs. Her compatriot, 1992 bronze medalist in the 5,000 m, Claudia Pechstein, was leading after Niemann’s fall with a strong time of 4:18.34. She had defeated another favorite, Carla Zijlstra, who had won the last pre-Olympic World Cup in absence of Niemann. In pair four, Hungarian-born Emese Hunyady (Austria) skated. The 1993 European Champion started out carefully, giving her the power for three fast final laps, landing her just ahead of Pechstein with 4:18.14. After six pairs, there was only one serious contender left: Svetlana Bazhanova. The Russian had placed second behind Niemann in the Berlin and Davos World Cups earlier in the year, and had been 3rd in the 3,000 m at the European Championships earlier in the season (behind Niemann and Zijlstra). Starting with the same pace as Pechstein, Bazhanova held on longer than the German, finishing in a new personal best of 4:17.43. The Olympic gold would remain Bazhanova’s only international title. In 1993 and 1998, she did win bronze medals at the European Allround Championships.

Chychła’s opponent in the final was Sergey Shcherbakov of the Soviet Union. The Soviets were making their first foray into international competition and Scherbakov was considered by team officials to be the poster boy for the USSR and a possible Olympic champion. To the surprise of the Soviets, though probably of few others, the technically gifted Pole was too good for his opponent and was a clear winner of the title.

A potentially disastrous accident occurred in heat two of this event.  At the beginning of the sprint, Mr. Harry Venn, a judge in the walking contests, wandered onto the track and Guillaume Coeckelberg (BEL) collided with him.  Coeckelberg was thrown from his bike, and struck his head on the concrete curb of the track.  Fortunately, neither was severely injured and Coeckelberg was able to remount and finish the race and qualify for the final as a result of having led the race for a sufficient number of laps.
The track was wet from rains at the start of the final of this event and intermittent rain saturated the riders for most of the race, which was marred by multiple punctures and accidents.  At 13 miles, Meredith was involved in a crash with Walter Andrews and D. C. Robertson.  He remounted but was off the back and could never rejoin the leading group.  Meredith was lapped at 62 laps, and he dismounted within the next mile.  The half-way mark (50 km.) was covered in 1-16:47.2, with Sydney Bailey (GBR) leading.
At 70 kilometres (115 laps) the leading pack numbered seven, including Charles Bartlett.  But Bartlett punctured, only to be paced back to the pack in eight laps by the Canadian, Harry Young.  The final lap came down to a pack of four - Bartlett, Charles Denny, Octave Lapize, and Billy Pett.  With three British riders, Lapize stood little chance, and the Brits paced the quick sprinting Bartlett, leading him out for the final sprint, which he won by about one wheel to earn the Prince of Wales Cup.  Bartlett had no other major international titles but won the NCU 50-mile tandem-paced championship in 1908 and 1909.  His time in winning this race was a world record, bettering the mark of 2-49:00.8 set by Capelle in Dijon, France on 20 October 1898.
Although Octave Lapize “only” earned the bronze medal, in 1910 he became the first former Olympic rider to win the Tour de France.  He also remains the only rider to win Paris-Roubaix in three consecutive years - 1909-11.  His other major professional titles included Paris-Brussels in 1911-13 and Paris-Tours in 1911.  Lapize was killed in a dogfight during World War I.
Paul Texier (FRA) [38 laps], Lapize [31 laps], and Denny [23 laps], received Diplomas of Merit for leading the greatest number of laps.  Bartlett led for only 16 laps.

Early in the race, Hamelin blocked Confortola and Treacy in an overtake attempt, causing the Italian to crash. Similarly, Ren arm blocked Galiakhmetov, meaning both Ren and Hamelin were penalized.

There were no penalties in the final, which saw a lot of lead changes in the opening laps. With 9 laps to go, Hwang Dae-Heon, moved up from the middle of the pack to the lead, passing all on the outside within a lap. Closely followed by Steven Dubois and Yelistratov, the Korean then gradually increased the pace, making it very hard for the others to pass.

Matz survived the burning crash, but returned to the wreckage to rescue two small children who had not escaped. They also survived thanks to Matz’s heroics. In 1998 Matz turned to thoroughbred training and in 2006 trained Barbaro, a horse that won the Kentucky Derby in dominant fashion and was considered a threat to win the Triple Crown. However, in the opening strides of the next race, the Preakness, Barbaro broke down, shattering a foreleg. He underwent multiple surgeries but was eventually put down in early 2007.

The second record was 70-7¼, the first throw ever over 70 feet. But in April 1967 he improved that by nearly a full foot, throwing 21.78 (71-5½). Matson opened with 20.54 (67-4¾) in Mexico and that settled the gold medal – it would be his best put of the competition. In fact all the top four had their best throws in round one – George Woods (USA) with 20.12 (66-0¼), Eduard Gushchin (URS) with 20.09 (65-11), and Dieter Hoffmann (GDR) with 20.00 (65-7½).

In the final, eventual bronze medalist Anatoly Samotsvetov (URS) led after round one with 62.10 (203-9) with Krivonosov second with 60.59 (198-9½), as Connolly fouled. Krivonosov took the lead in round two with 63.00 (206-8½), while Connolly’s 60.92 (199-10½) put him in third place, trailing his teammate Al Hall. Krivonosov improved slightly in the third round with 63.03 (206-9½) while Connolly moved into second with 62.65 (205-6½). Krivonosov would do no better, fouling his final three throws. In round five, Connolly secured the gold medal with 63.19 (207-3¾). Connolly also generated headlines in Melbourne by his romance with Czechoslovakian discus throw gold medalist Olga Fikotová. They fell in love and married in Praha a few months after the Olympics, overcoming what Connolly once described as “mountains of red tape.” The best man at the ceremony was Czech distance running legend Emil Zátopek.
The third American, Cliff Blair, had set a short-lived American record of 65.95 in July, and likely would have challenged for a medal. It bettered Krivonosov’s world record, but was never recognized as a world record, for unknown reasons. Blair never made got to compete at the Olympics. He was helping Boston Globe sportswriter Jerry Nason with columns from Melbourne, and was thrown off the US team for violating amateur rules by serving as a sportswriter, although Nason stood up for him, insisting that he was writing the columns, and Blair was only speaking through him.

One potential competitor was Spain’s Saúl Craviotto, who had been the runner-up in London and was already in top form after winning the K-2 200 earlier in the Games.

Craviotto finished behind Maxime Beaumont of France, the 2015 World runner-up, while de Jonge was third in a heat won by Germany’s Ronald Rauhe, a decorated canoeist with five K-1 200 World Championship titles dating back to 2001. De Jonge struggled again in the semifinals, placing fourth in his heat behind Heath, Rauhe, and Craviotto and avoiding elimination by a mere 0.003 seconds. Beaumont was the winner of the other semifinal. In the final, Beaumount started in the lead but was soon passed by Heath, who held on to capture gold a mere 0.165 seconds ahead of the Frenchman. In the race for bronze, it appeared at first that Craviotto had barely edged out Rauhe, but a closer examination of the finish revealed that they had both crossed the line at exactly 35.662 seconds, and thus both were awarded third place.

As in all the women’s events, the Soviet women were favored, having won all the all-around medals at the World Championships since 1953. The event was hampered by high winds, which also slowed the men’s 1,500 and 5,000. The early pace was set in the first pair by Klara Guseva, who finished in 2:28.7. That lasted until the seventh pair, when Polish skater Elwira Seroczyńska bettered the time by a full three seconds. Although she had skated at World Championships in 1957, 1959, and 1960, she was not highly considered, never having placed better than ninth at any distance in those events, and no better than 10th, at the 1959 Worlds. Two pairs later, Lidiya Skoblikova started alongside Seroczyńska’s teammate, Helena Pilejczyk. They went out at the same pace through 700 metres, but Skoblikova gradually pulled ahead, and would win the race, posting a world record 2:25.2. Pilejczyk held on for 2:27.1, which brought her the bronze medal, behind her teammate.
Skoblikova would return two days later to win a second gold medal in Squaw Valley. In 1964 at Innsbruck she set Olympic history by winning all four women’s speed skating events, giving her six gold medals in all. She was especially dominant in 1963-64, winning the World Championships both years, and winning all four distances at both meets. As for the Polish women, their medals were major upsets. Through 2006, no other Polish speed skater has won a medal at the Winter Olympics, although Seroczyńska would win the 500 distance at the 1962 World Championships. Pilejczyk had been the stronger skater prior to Squaw Valley, placing second at the 1960 Worlds in the 1,000, and fifth all-around at the 1958 and 1960 World Championships. She would have a long career, competing through the 1971 World Championships, but never again ascended a podium at a major international.

Sweden’ Lars Nelson led marginally over Finland at the end of the first leg with France close behind, while Russia was far behind in eighth place. Sweden’s Daniel Richardsson and Finland’s Iivo Niskanen came to the second exchange almost simultaneously, while a strong leg by Lukáš Bauer brought the Czech team within 17 sec of the leaders.
Johan Olsson skied the third leg for Sweden and was the team’s top performer, soon pulling away from Lari Lehtonen, who was also overtaken by Aleksandr Legkov, making a major effort for the Russian team. His time was 27 seconds faster than Olsson’s and brought Russia to second place only 14 sec behind the leaders. 
On the final leg, Marcus Hellner was able to ski comfortably to victory for Sweden. Ivan Perrillat Boiteux briefly brought the French team level with the Russians, but Maksim Vylegzhanin secured second place for Russia 4.6 seconds ahead of the French team – a major upset which brought the country its 100th medal in Olympic Winter Games. As in the ladies’ relay Norway was the favorite, but again failed to medal, placing fourth.
By winning the 4x10 km relay Sweden successfully defended the title with three members of the team –  Richardsson, Olsson and Hellner – from their victorious Vancouver squad in 2010. Moreover, Sweden became the first country in 42 years to win both the men’s and women’s relay events at one Olympic Winter Games.
In May 2016 WADA (World Anti-Doping Agency) commissioned a report, the McLaren Report, to look into allegations of systematic Russian doping and a cover-up to avoid positives at the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics. The report was released in two parts, in July and December 2016, and confirmed the allegations. In 2017 the IOC formed a commission to investigate this, headed by IOC Member Denis Oswald, and usually referred to as the Oswald Commission. In late October 2017 the Oswald Commission began to release its findings.
One of the first findings was to implicate Aleksandr Legkov, one of the Russian skiiers in this event. Legkov was disqualified, as was the Russian relay team, and their silver medal effectively removed. Eight days later, on 9 November, Maksim Vylegzhanin, another Russian skiier, was also disqualified, followed shortly thereafter by the disqualification of Aleksandr Bessmertnykh. Legkov and Vylegzhanin immediately appealed to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS). About 10 days before the PyeongChang Winter Olympics began, the CAS reached a decision and both Legkov and Vylegzhanin were exonerated and the Russian relay medal was restored.

Most recently Khyzhniak had taken a controversial victory over Bakshi to win the European Qualifying event. Of course, that’s not quite how it played out.
At the top of the draw #1 seed Khyzhniak eased into the semi-finals but had all the trouble he could handle from the roughhouse Filipino Eumir Marcial. In the fight that gave rise to profoundly different opinions from the judges, the Ukrainian edged out a win by 3-2.
The big punching Bakshi had survived the best efforts of American based professionals Troy Isley and Darrelle Valsaint, Jr. to meet Hebert Conceição for a place in the final. For once, the Russian could not impose his physicality on the smoother boxing Brazilian and went down to a defeat on four of the five judges’ scorecards.
The tables were turned in the final. This time it was the skilful Khyzhniak who controlled the fight. The Ukrainian won the first two rounds conclusively but halfway through the final round, he dropped his guard for an instant. This gave the Brazilian the chance to land a perfectly delivered left hook that sent Khyzhniak to the canvas. Khyzhniak rose to his feet quickly, but the referee decided that he was in no position to continue the fight and gold went to Conceição.

Thereafter he was absent from major competitions for three years as he switched allegiances to Bulgaria and made his return by winning a bronze medal at the 2011 European Championships prior to his victory at the World Championships. He faced challenges from several wrestlers in his quest for Olympic glory, most notably Jimmy Lidberg of Sweden, who was twice runner-up (2009 and 2011) and once a bronze medalist (2010) at the World Championships.
Guri and Lidberg were drawn into the same half, setting up a potentially exciting semi-final match, but it was not to be: both wrestlers were eliminated in the quarterfinals. Guri was defeated by Timofey Deynichenko of Belarus, runner-up at the 2010 European and World Championships, while Lindberg was bested by 2011 World Championship bronze medalist Rustam Totrov of Russia. Totrov then conquered Deynichenko in the semifinals, eliminating any chance of Guri winning a medal. In the final the Russian met Ghasem Rezaei of Iran, a two-time Asian Champion (2007 and 2008) whose best finish at the World Championships was third in 2007.The first round went to par terre where, although Totrov almost managed to rise from the bottom position, he was taken down at the last moment by Rezaei and scored upon. The second period again went to par terre, despite the best efforts of the Russian, who was unable to convert his top advantage to a point, even with a fantastic push that tossed both competitors out of the ring simultaneously (and therefore scored no points). Thus Iran, which had begun the 2012 Olympics with zero Greco-Roman gold medals to its name, left the tournament with three, following earlier victories by Hamid Soryan and Omid Noroozi in the featherweight and lightweight categories respectively.
Lidberg and Deynichenko, meanwhile, met up in a bronze medal bout, where Deynichenko took an early lead by reversing the Swede’s advantage in the first par terre and scoring two points in the dying seconds of the period. Lidberg struck back in the next two rounds, however, starting with a successful defense in the second par terre that forced a third, decisive period. This round too went to par terre, but the Swede had fewer cautions and was therefore granted the top advantage, using it to score four points to Deynichenko’s one in the final twenty-two seconds of the match and clinch the bronze. The final podium spot was decided between Yunior Estrada of Cuba and Artur Aleksanyan of Armenia, the 2012 European Champion and 2011 runner-up. For many years, including an appearance at the 2008 Summer Olympics, Estrada was a light-heavyweight wrestler and had won bronze in this division at the 2007 Pan American Games. He had switched to heavyweight by 2010, however, and won gold at the 2011 Pan American Games. In the bronze medal bout, Aleksanyan was dominant: he converted his top advantage in the round one par terre to two points and then pushed Estrada out of the ring in the second period to claim victory.

Alakhverdiyev had won the 1972 European Championships and would win that title again in 1973 and 1975. As always, Kim had no known international record, as North Korea rarely let their athletes venture out of the country except for the Olympics.

Known as “Abigator” by her team-mates, she had a great 2015 season capped with a Grand Series Final win. She was known for her famous and rare ‘scorpion kick’ to the head from close range.
The second seed, Elin Johansson of Sweden, reached the quarter-final in London in 2012 and was a bronze medallist at the 2015 European Games and was renowned for her powerful head attacks. Also in contention was the highly experienced 2015 world champion Chuang Chia-Chia of Chinese Taipei, who was the third seed. Nur Tatar of Turkey was another experienced fighter and was seeded fourth. She won the silver medal in 2012 and was also a silver medallist in the 2015 World and 2016 European Championships. Another one to watch was the reigning 73kg World Champion Oh Hye-Ri of South Korea, who lost weight in order compete in the welterweight division and consequently was one of the stronger fighters in this division, which also featured 17-year- old Nigora Tursunkulova of Uzbekistan. the youngest competitor in the entire taekwondo competition.
Nairé scraped through her opening bout 5-4 against Aniya Louissant of Haiti but Elin Johansson lost on superiority to the youngster Tursunkulova (after drawing 2-2), and Chuang Chia-chia and Oh Hye-ri progressed to the quarter-finals with relative ease. It was another close 5-4 win for Niaré in the quarters, this time against Ruth Gbagbi of the Ivory Coast, as she set up a semi-final meeting with Turkey’s Tatar. This time the Niaré was taken to sudden-death before winning through to the final. The other semi-final saw Hye-ri, who beat Chia-Chia 21-9 in the quarters, pitched against Fəridə Əzizova of Azerbaijan, who ended the dreams of the 17-year-old Tursunkulova. It was the South Korean Oh Hye-ri who went on to meet Niaré in the final after a narrow 6-5 victory.
The number one seed Niaré had to endure yet another close encounter, but this time she lost and had to settle for the silver medal after a 12-13 defeat by the sixth seeded Korean. Niaré led 1-0 after the first round with a later kick. The French woman scored early in the second but two quick kicking attacks and knocking Niaré to the ground saw Hye-ri built 10-4 lead in round two. Nairé attacked in the final round but, despite winning it 8-3, she lost the contest by one point.
The bronze medals went to Nur Tatur and the number nine seed Ruth Gbagbi, who made history as the first Ivory Coast athlete to win a Taekwondo medal, as she became only the second athlete from her country to win an Olympic medal after track athlete Gabriel Tiacoh won the 400 metres silver medal in 1984. Remarkably, after a 32-year wait for their second Olympic medal, Ivory Coast won their third medal just over an hour later when Cheick Sallah Cissé in the men’s taekwondo welterweight division gave his country not only its third medal but its first ever Olympic gold.

Oscar Goerke briefly went out in the tenth mile when one of his tires exploded.  He remounted on another bike, and kept riding until the 17th mile when he punctured again and withdrew.  Four riders remained together going into the last two laps:  Burton Downing, George Wiley, Sam LaVoice, and Arthur Andrews.  Andrews led beginning the next-to-last lap but Downing jumped him on the backstretch of the last lap and won by a length and a half with Wiley third, four lengths behind the Indianapolis rider.  Wiley did win a special lap prize for having led 35 laps of the race.

But in round one, Kye was upset by France’s Barbara Harel, whose bronze medal at the 2008 Europeans was her previous claim to fame.

They dominated the 2018-19 season but, at the 2020 European Championships, they suffered a surprise loss to the Russian pair of Viktoriya Sinitsina and Nikita Katsalapov.
With the French pair sidelined for the entirety of the winter of 2020-21 by a mixture of injury, illness and cancellations provoked by the pandemic, Sinitsina and Katsalapov went on an unbeaten run that encompassed wins at the 2021 World Championships and 2022 European Championships. The two pairs were not to meet again until the Beijing Winter Olympics.
Some people blamed Papadakis and Cizeron missing out on the gold medal in 2018 on a wardrobe malfunction in the rhythm program that left Papadakis’ breast exposed for the majority of the performance, but this time everything stayed in place and they wowed the judges and posted a world best score for the segment. In the free program the American duo of Madison Hubbell and Zach Donohue kept their grasp on the bronze medal over teammates Madison Chock and Evan Bates despite a deduction for exceeding the time limit for a hold.
Although the Russians performed well, Papadakis and Cizeron were marginally better and extended their winning margin when skating to French composer Gabriel Faure’s “Requiem”. They emulated Marina Anissina and Gwendal Peizerat’s victory for France in the 2002 Games in Salt Lake City.

The two tied at the 1995 Worlds, but Dimas won on lower bodyweight, so this was expected to be a close contest between the two. However, when Dimas snatched a world record 180.0 kg, he made it very difficult for Huster, who was 10 kg behind. Both lifted world records of 212.5 kg, as Dimas defended his gold medal with a total of 392.5 kg. At Sydney, the two would renew their rivalry with the same result, but in 2000 they would tie on total weight, Dimas winning his third gold medal because of lower bodyweight. Dimas would also win a bronze medal in this class at the 2004 Olympics.

Seventeen teams started, but only the top eight teams advanced to the second round. The event closed the Olympics as it was held at the Olympic Stadium in the main Olympic park shortly before the Closing Ceremony.
Over the last 18 months the West Germans (FRG) had won more Nations’ Cup events than any other country, but there was no truly dominant team, and the United States had also won several Nations’ Cups in 1971-72. In the first round these two teams led, with West Germany slightly ahead, 16.00 to 16.25 faults. It was still close in the second round, with both teams receiving 16 faults in the second round, giving West Germany the gold medal and the USA the silver.

Italy, with a crew of Ruggero Tita and Caterina Banti, who had won the 2018 Worlds, and Great Britain, represented by John Gimson and Anna Burnet, the 2020 World Champions, quickly showed they were the class of the event, winning five of the first six races.
