Best six of seven scores to count for final placement.,na,"By winning three of the first four races, and placing second in race two, the Soviet pair of Timir Pinegin and Fyodor Shutkov took a big lead, and were never challenged in winning the first Soviet gold medal in yachting. Their boat, the Tornado, had actually been built in Old Greenwich, Connecticut, in the United States. The Star boats raced on the Giallo course, as did the Flying Dutchman class. In fourth place was the Italian boat helmed by Agostino Straulino, who had won this event in 1952 and placed second in 1956, and who had won multiple World and European Championships. In 19th place the helmsman of the Thai boat was Birabongse, Prince Bhanubandh, a Thai prince who also raced Formula One cars.

The nandao event uses the dao, a curved one-sided blade. At the World Championships, both events are held separately, but these were combined for the Olympic exhibition.
This event was dominated by China’s Lin Fan. The 2007 nanquan World Champion, she clearly won both discplines, finishing half a point ahead of her competition. Reigning nandao World Champion Huang Yan Hui disappointed with a fourth place, both in her specialty and the overall ranking.

The leader through most of the race was Norway’s Bjørn Dæhlie, who was first at 1.9 km, 8.6 km, and 15 km. But he was passed at the 23.6 km checkpoint by his teammate, Vegard Ulvang. And Ulvang would then finish very strongly, winning the gold medal by 46.2 seconds over Dæhlie. The bronze medal would go to their teammate, Terje Langli, as Norway posted the first medal sweep in men’s cross-country skiing since the 1948 15 km, when Sweden won all three medals.
This was the start of quite a Winter Olympics for Ulvang. He would win four medals and three gold, adding victories in the 10 km and relay, and a silver in the pursuit. Ulvang had trained in 1991 by climbing Denali (Mt. McKinley), the tallest mountain in North America, and then traveling to Greenland, where he skied across the country. This was the first ever Olympic event for Dæhlie but he would also win four medals and three golds in Albertville, winning the pursuit, 50 km, and relay, in addition to his silver in this event. In his career he would become the most medaled Winter Olympian, eventually winning 12 medals, eight gold and four silver. Langli had competed at the 1988 Winter Olympics, but this would be his only individual Olympic medal, although he would add a gold in the relay in Albertville.

Russia’s Svetlana Khorkina had been the world’s top gymnast since the 1997 Olympics and the uneven bars were her best event. Unfortunately, in the team qualifying she had fallen off the bars, scored only a 9.000, and placed 29th. But the rules now allowed teams to substitute a gymnast into the finals, as long as they had a finals qualifier, and Russia had two. Yelena Produnova led the qualifying, but Yelena Zamolodchikova had placed only eighth, and she would have to watch, as she was bypassed in favor of Khorkina. Khorkina had also fallen off the bars in the individual all-around so her form was suspect, but she returned to her norm in the uneven bars final, scoring a 9.862 to win the gold.
The other medals went to the two Chinese finalists, Ling Jie and Yun Yang. Ling had won a bronze medal on the bars at the 1999 Worlds, behind Khorkina, while Yun was best known as a one-time love interest of China’s 2008 Olympic all-around gold medalist Yang Wei. Like her teammate, Dong Fangxiao, Yun was suspected of being underage at the 2000 Olympics, but the 2010 investigation by the Fédération Internationale de Gymnastique (FIG) was inconclusive in her case.

The event one day was delayed because of poor weather. The leader after the downhill was Katja Seizinger with Pernilla Wiberg close behind in second. This made Wiberg the favorite because she was a better slalom skier. But on the first run, Wiberg caught a tip on a gate near the finish and did not finish. Seizinger was steady in the slalom, placing fifth in that section, to win her third Olympic gold medal. She was followed by her two teammates, Martina Ertl and Hilde Gerg (winner of the slalom gold in Nagano), giving Germany only the fourth medal sweep in Olympic Alpine skiing, after Austria in 1956 men’s giant slalom, Austria in 1964 women’s downhill, and Norway in 1994 men’s combined.

Pozdnyakov opened up a big lead, Sharikov fought back to 13-12 but Pozdnyakov killed off his hopes by scoring two more hits to win the gold medal.
All three Russians were amongst the top five seeds in the competition.

He won the sprint double at the NCAA Championship, and then won the US Olympic Trials, defeating Eddie Tolan, who had been the top sprinter in the US in 1929-31. The final was an intercontinental one, with three Americans, George Simpson joining Metcalfe and Tolan, Arthur Jonath of Germany, Danie Joubert of South Africa, and the first Asian to make an Olympic final, Takayoshi Yoshioka of Japan. Yoshioka was a very fast starter and he opened in the lead. But he was quickly caught by Tolan at 30 metres, who led until he was caught by Metcalfe at about 80 metres. At the tape there was little to choose between them, and even the electric timer gave them both the same time of 10.38, but Tolan was chosen as the gold medalist, with Metcalfe second, and Jonath getting the bronze.
Despite the electric timing, mistakes could still happen in this era. In the first semi-final, Tolan was declared the victor over Joubert, with both timed in 10.81, and Yoshioka third in 10.83. But film of the race, available on youtube (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjMcr_elhd4 as of September 2013), clearly shows that Yoshioka won, with Joubert second, and Tolan third. It did not matter in the final outcome, however, as all three qualified for the final.

Best three scores to count for the team total. Team/individual competitions held concurrently.,na,"The format of three-day eventing was changed in 2004 with the abolition of the first three phases of the cross-country section. The two “roads and tracks” sections and steeplechase phase were discarded and the main cross-country section was shortened in length although the number of jumping efforts remained constant.
The United States arrived in Athina as reigning world champions, Great Britain were European champions and Germany, France and Australia also had high expectations. The two days of dressage produced a minor surprise with Germany, who had been expected to gain a lead, back in third place. Great Britain and France led the way although only a single penalty covered the first three teams.
The cross-country phase was unusually short of drama, not one member of the four leading nations incurred a jumping penalty and the ability of the French team to keep inside the time limit meant they took the lead. Germany moved into second with the British, Americans and Australians vying for third. The veterinary inspection before the final show jumping consolidated the French lead when a scoring member of each of the German, British and Australian teams were not passed as fit to compete.
The French had a disappointing show jumping phase and the steady performances of the Germans gave them an unassailable lead before the final French rider entered the arena. The final French rider, Nicolas Touzaint, only knocked down one fence for four penalties, a performance that became more important as events unfolded.
For the first time in Olympic history, a second round of show jumping would be used to decide the individual competition but before this could be held the results of the team competition were to be changed and then changed back again. The controversy concerned the German rider Bettina Hoy, television pictures revealed she had crossed the start line, triggering the electronic timing, and then turned full circle and crossed the start line again. After her clear round she had appeared to have helped Germany win the title but the FEI Grand Jury had noticed the infringement and added a further 14 time penalties to the score.
A meeting of the Jury of Appeal was convened after a German protest and “In the interests of fairness” Hoy’s score was returned to its’ original mark. The judge in charge of the timing had, against the rules, re-set the primary timer to zero when the rider passed the starting beam on the second occasion. An FEI spokesman said that “The change of the result is due to a wrong start procedure, which has been confirmed by the jury.” Hoy went on to win a second gold in the individual competition later the same evening.
The French, British and US teams immediately launched an appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) concerning the results. On the 20th of August the CAS released their decision; The CAS said the judges’ decision should not have been reversed by the FEI because the body had no right to do so. The Jury of Appeal had only the right to make decisions regarding the interpretation of rules and the CAS said it decided that the judges’ decision to impose a time penalty on Hoy “was of a purely factual nature, falling within its exclusive jurisdiction.” The extra time penalties demoted Germany to fourth position leaving France to take gold ahead of Great Britain and the USA. Bettina Hoy was also demoted from first to ninth in the individual event.

East Germany’s Angelika Bahmann, the reigning World Champion, was the favorite, but she would certainly be challenged by Czechoslovakia’s Ludmila Polesná, the 1967 and 1969 World Champion and 1971 runner-up. After the first run, Bahmann was in second after West Germany’s Magdalena Wunderlich, a relatively unheralded competitor. Poland’s Maria Ćwiertniewicz, meanwhile, was a distant third. Bahmann underwent a massive improvement in the second run and posted an impressive score that was more than sufficient to win gold. The biggest jump, however, came from West Germany’s Gisela Grothaus, who was ninth in round one, but runner-up in the second round and earned enough points to nab the silver medal. Ćwiertniewicz, meanwhile, improved her score, but not enough to pass Wunderlich, whose run one score allowed her to take bronze.

Johansson later emigrated to the United States in 1913, where she married Ernst Brandsten, seventh in 1912 Men’s Plain High Diving.  They settled in California and Ernst was coach at Stanford for many U.S. Olympic divers.  He was also coach of the U.S. Olympic diving team in 1936 at Berlin.

(121.9 miles) mass start race.,na,"The road race course consisted of eight laps of a 24.525 km. course, which was quite hilly.  The course allowed the field to break apart more so than in any Olympic road race since the mass start format had begun in 1936. There was no heavy favorite as the last three World Championships had seen nine different riders on the podium. Pierfranco Vianelli broke away from the leading group on the last lap and won with almost a minute and a half to spare. Runner-up Leif Mortensen won the 1969 World Championship. Vianelli had a great professional début the following year, placing seventh in the Tour de France. After that little was heard of him until he concluded an impressive solo win at the Giro d’Italia stage on top of the Großglockner – his last major win.
The Mexico race featured several future cycling greats. “Jempi” Monseré finished in fifth place, but won the professional world title in 1970. Six months later, the Belgian was killed in a collision with a car during a race. Compatriot Roger De Vlaeminck (18th) was the best classics cyclist during the 1970s, excelling in the grueling Paris-Roubaix race, which he won four times. In 2005, De Vlaeminck presented a Belgian television show in which he coached several cyclists from Zimbabwe to appear in the World Cyclo-Cross Championships. Finally, non-finisher Joop Zoetemelk would become a Tour de France winner in 1980, and was second in “La Grand Boucle” no less than six times.

Another strong medal contender was Nina Zhivanevskaya who had won a hat-trick of European titles just a few months before the Olympics. Originally from Russia, she had been an Olympic medal winner as part of the Unified team but had married a Spaniard and gained Spanish citizenship in 1999.
Both women made the Olympic podium in Sydney but the top step was reserved for the 16-year-old Diana Mocanu of Romania. That Mocanu should do well at the Olympics was not a complete surprise but a victory was deemed to be unlikely. Nakamura took the first part of the race at breakneck speed and was well under world record splits at halfway. The Japanese swimmer still led with 25 metres to go but she began to pay for her fast start and, as she faded, Mocanu came through to record the first victory by a Romania swimmer in an Olympic final.

Elliot and Jensen tied for first place but Jensen was awarded first place by the judges, based on his having lifted in a better style, as apparently Elliot moved one foot while lifting his weight.  From the article by Ian Buchanan in Citius, Altius, Fortius (Vol. 3, No. 1, p. 20), we have:
“The two-handed lift came first on the program and, after a long drawn out contest, Viggo Jensen of Denmark and Elliot had both lifted 110 kg., but Prince George awarded the Dane first place for having done so in better style.  Jensen’s lift was accomplished with a superb clean lift whereas Elliot had certainly encountered difficulty but to award the Olympic title on the basis of ‘style’ was a decision to which Lawrence Levy, understandably, took exception.
“Levy’s main objection was that, as both contestants had lifted the same weight, they should now each be given the chance to lift a heavier weight in accordance with all known weightlifting protocol.  Prince George then agreed with Levy’s view but the decision was rendered academic by the rider to the judgment that there were, in fact, no heavier weights available.  Levy stood his ground and eventually plates were screwed onto the barbell and lifting was resumed.  After Jensen had raised the bar, Levy again objected, this time on the grounds that Jensen’s method was not in accordance with the rules.
“Again Prince George sided against Levy and once more lifting was resumed, by which time most of the spectators had left but they didn’t miss a great deal as, eventually, the original result based on ‘style’ was allowed to stand.  By contrast, the one-handed event was a short, sharp event.  Elliot declined Prince George’s courteous offer of a rest break but he asked that he might this time lift after Jensen, as in the two-handed event the Dane had the advantage of lifting after Elliot.  The request was granted although the order of lifting was not to have a material effect on the result.  Elliot raised 71.0 kg. without difficulty whereas Jensen, who had injured his shoulder trying to raise 112.5 kg. in the two-handed event, could only manage 57.2 kg. and Britain’s first Olympic champion was crowned.
“One feature that stands out from the judging of the competition is the inherent courtesy exercised by Prince George throughout the proceedings.  Despite the constant protests of Lawrence Levy, the Prince sought him out that evening at an illumination display at the Royal Palace, and smilingly enquired ‘Are you calmer now, Mr. Levy?’”
Levy was apparently unaware of the rules stating that the tie-breaker was the style of the lift.

Mathiesen opened with 17:41.2, a new Olympic Record. This time was challenged by Max Stiepl in the third pair. The 10 km was the Austrian’s best event: he had won it twice at European Championships, and had finished second to Wasenius in the World Championships at Davos prior to the Olympics. His final time of 17:30.0 was more than 20 seconds faster than his time at the fast Swiss rink, and a medal looked certain. Much depended on the next race, between Ivar Ballangrud and Birger Wasenius. Both skaters had won medals in the previous days, but Wasenius had not yet beaten Ballangrud. The two went out much faster than Stiepl, and were neck-to-neck for 4 kilometres. Ballangrud then started to edge ahead, taking a little more advantage each lap. Towards, the end, Wasenius crept back a little, but could not close the 5-second gap.
Wasenius’s split time at the bell was equal to that of Stiepl, but he won nearly two seconds in that last lap, for his second silver medal of the Games, and third medal in all. Ballangrud improved on his season’s best with 17:24.3, only seven seconds from the World Record.

Defending champion Catriona Le May Doan had absolutely dominated the event in the 2001-2002 season. She had won all six World Cup races, bettering the World Record twice during competition in Calgary. She had also won the distance twice en route to winning the World Sprint Championships. In addition, she was also the 1998, 1999 and 2001 World Champion. During the season, several women had made the podium behind the Canadian, notably Sabine Völker (Germany), Andrea Nuyt (Netherlands) and Svetlana Zhurova. Based on results of past seasons, Monique Garbrecht-Enfeldt (Germany) was also highly considered.
In the first run, Le May opened in a blistering 10.22, and only narrowly missed her 37.22 world record with 37.30. In the following pair, veteran Garbrecht-Enfeldt came remarkably close to the leading mark, with 37.34, being followed by Nuyt at two tenths. These three women were in medal positions at the end of day one, with Zhurova and Völker not far from the bronze medal. The first of these medal hopefuls to skate the second run was Völker, who improved her first run time by 0.05 to 37.57. Both Zhurova and Nuyt then performed much worse than on their first attempt, both falling in the overall standings in favor of Völker. The final run was between the two leaders. As in 1998 Le May won the title, copying her Nagano performance closely by winning both runs, narrowly in the first and more clearly in the second.

He had not set any world records but was almost unbeatable in the British Isles.  Since the retirement of Sam Jones, the United States had failed to produce a dominant high jumper.  The top U.S. jumper was Bert Kerrigan, the 1905 AAU champion, but he had been injured on the boat ride over when the Barbarossa was hit by a large wave.  Because of the injury, his chances were thought to be slim.
The event started on Monday, 30 April [17 April], but ran long and had to be stopped due to darkness.  This was probably due to the fact that the bar was started at 1.375 metres, and raised one centimetre at a time.  In addition, all competitors had to jump at every height - no passes were allowed!  When the bar reached 1.675, seven competitors remained, and as dusk was fast approaching, it was then agreed to move the bar 2.5 centimetres at a time.  Before the competition was halted, Bruno Söderström and Halfdan Bjølgerud were eliminated.
The next day the remaining five - Con Leahy, Lajos Gönczy, Bert Kerrigan, Gunnar Rönström, and Themistoklis Diakidis - agreed to start at 1.75 metres, and only Leahy and Gönczy succeeded.  Leahy then cleared 1.775 to end the marathon contest.  He made two attempts at 1.85 metres, but missed them both, and declined the third attempt.
Con Leahy was one of seven Irish brothers who were all excellent athletes.  Pat Leahy had finished 2nd in the 1900 Olympic high jump; Tim Leahy led the 1912 world ranking list in the high jump; and Joe Leahy surpassed 7.00 metres in the long jump.  In August 1909, Con and Pat Leahy emigrated to the United States, where they both lived until their deaths.

Some games were played against an Australian team, while others were against New South Wales, Queensland, Victoria, South Australia and Western Australia teams. In all, the American team only lost one game, that to Australia on 5 December, 2-1.

Their best hurdler in recent years had been Aries Merritt, who set a world record after the 2012 Olympics, and was third at the 2015 World Championships while suffering from end-stage kidney disease. After that meet Merritt underwent a kidney transplant and returned to competition in early 2016, but he failed to make the US team at the trials. Another top hurdler was Cuban Dayron Robles, the 2008 Olympic champion and a former world record holder, but he was not in Rio, out with injuries.
In their absence the event was wide open. The event started in a torrential downpour, which affected the first two heats. The rain then relented, and the officials gave the non-qualifiers from the first two heats a re-run in an extra heat, allowing them to qualify on time, but only Deuce Carter was able to do so. The final was won by Jamaican Omar McLeod, who had won the World Indoor Championships over 60 metres earlier in the year. He was followed by Cuban Orlando Ortega (representing Spain in Rio), with France’s Dimitri Bascou taking bronze. Devon Allen finished fifth, the highest placed American. It was the first time in the history of the event that no American won a medal, save for the boycotted 1980 Olympics.

Sheffield Speed Skating Oval, Lake Placid",36 from 16 countries,na,na,"By the time the 1,500 started, Eric Heiden had won three gold medals and he was a safe bet in the 1,500. The 1,500 was one of his two best distances, with the 1,000. He had not been defeated internationally since the 1977 World All-Arounds, and in January 1980, had broken the world record, posting 1:54.79 in Davos only a month before the Olympics. His biggest competition was expected to come from two Norwegians, Jan Egil Storholt and Kai Arne Stenshjemmet. Storholt had been second at the last three World All-Arounds, to Heiden, and was the 1977 and 1979 European All-Around Champion, but his 1,500 PR was 1:55.18, not far from Heiden’s world record, and the previous world mark, but it had been set at the Kazakh speed factory of Medeo. Stenshjemmet usually had trouble beating Storholt, placing second to him at the 1977 and 1979 Europeans, and third at the 1979 World All-Around, and his 1,500 best was much slower than Storholt’s, at 1:57.50. Storholt started in the first pair and posted 1:57.95 on the slow Lake Placid ice. Nobody in the second or third pairs bettered that time, and it came down to Heiden and Stenshjemmet, skating together in the fourth pair. Heiden set off at a mad pace, posting 24.49 for the first 300 metres and was well ahead. But near the end of the second lap, at about 600 metres, he hit a rut in the ice, and almost fell, having to put down a hand to steady himself. It seemingly cost him up to a second in time, but it mattered little, as he recovered easily and defeated Stenshjemmet by slightly over 1¼ seconds in 1:55.44. Stenshjemmet’s time would be good enough for his second silver medal, adding to one from the 5K. Skating in the next pair, another Norwegian, Terje Andersen, posted 1:56.92 for the bronze medal. Heiden now had four gold medals, tieing him with Lidiya Skoblikova , who in 1964 had won all four women’s speed skating events. He had only the 10K left to conquer.

Park had already been lucky to avoid disqualification in his opening bout against Abdullah Ramadan of Sudan before he began a run of three close and controversial points decisions. In particular his quarter-final victory against Italy’s Vincenzo Nardiello drew criticism as most impartial observers believed the Italian was a deserving winner.
In contrast Roy Jones, Jr. had strolled past his opposition with a knockout and three decisive points decisions. His showboating style may have given offence for its’ supposed lack of respect for his opponents but none could deny his talent.
For the three rounds of the final, Jones appeared in complete control and most observers viewed the fight as a complete shutout for the American. The computer punch count recorded that Jones had landed nearly three times as many punches as Park (86-32). When the result was announced it was revealed that the Soviet and Hungarian judges had awarded the fight to Jones by four point margins but the other three had voted for the Korean. The decision was widely condemned as one of the worst in Olympic history and directly led to the introduction of electronic punch counters at the 1992 Olympic Games.
In 1997 the International Amateur Boxing Federation presented the IOC with information concerning allegations that some of the judges had received bribes at the 1988 Olympics. The IOC concluded that the charges were not proven. Unusually for a non-Olympic champion, Jones was awarded the Val Barker Trophy for best boxer of the Games.
Jones used the publicity gained in Seoul to start a lucrative career in the professional and emerged as one of the greatest boxers of the end of the 20th century. He won world titles at four different weights and became the first man for more than a century to win the world championship at middleweight, light-heavyweight and heavyweight.

Ranked number one in the world, the nation was a favorite in the tournament, but its skip, Brad Jacobs, was relatively less distinguished, with only the 2013 Canadian National Championship and a silver medal from the last World Championship under his belt. Niklas Edin, number two ranked Sweden’s skip, was much better known: aside from being the defending World Champion, he was third in 2011 and 2012, European Champion in 2009 and 2012 (and runner-up in 2011), and had finished fourth at the 2010 Winter Olympics. Ranked number three in the world was Great Britain, skipped by two-time World Champion (2006 and 2009) and 2010 Olympian David Murdoch. Norway and Switzerland were also considered as having an outside chance to reach the podium.
Edin’s rink emerged from round robin play with the best record, 8-1, its only loss having been a surprising defeat at the hands of Denmark’s Rasmus Stjerne. Canada and China, skipped by Olympic veteran Liu Rui, automatically advanced to the playoffs, while Murdoch had to win a close tiebreaking match against 2010 Olympic runner-up Thomas Ulsrud of Norway in order to progress, which was decided in Murdoch’s favor only in the final end. In the playoffs, the closest match was the semifinal between Great Britain and Sweden, who were never more than one point apart the entire game. Murdoch, however, was able to able to come from behind and score two points in the final end, relegating the favored Swedes to a bronze medal match against China, who had lost their own semifinal against Canada 10-6 (although they had been tied 4-4 in the 6th end and were 7-6 at the conclusion of the 9th end). China and Sweden went neck and neck for the third podium spot, but Edin managed capture the final two ends, which catapulted him to victory.
The gold medal game was no contest: Jacobs was up 5-1 by the end of the third end and 8-2 at the conclusion of the sixth one. At their earliest opportunity, the end of the eighth end, the British team conceded with a score of 9-3, giving Canada its third consecutive Olympic curling gold medal. With Jennifer Jones’ victory the previous day, the nation finally achieved the goal it had set out to achieve 16 years earlier, winning both Olympic curling gold medals in the same year, and became the first country to do so.

From the perspective of that tournament, Qi Guangpu, also of China, was a contender, as he was the 2013 and 2015 World Champion and 2011 and 2017 runner-up. He had also come in fourth in Sochi. American Jonathon Lillis was the reigning World Champion.
That Lillis won the qualifying round was not particularly surprising, but much more shocking was that Kushnir failed to advance beyond the second qualification stage, falling just 0.45 points shy of making the cut off. The final was divided into three runs, each of which was independent of the other and after which the bottom three competitors would be eliminated. Qi was on top after the first run but Morris, who attempted the same trick, did not nail his execution and was forced to bow out. In the following run, however, it was Qi who was surprisingly eliminated, while Lillis also faltered and exited the tournament. That left Jia as the last remaining favorite and, had the event been determined by the best of three runs, he would have won gold on the strength of his score in the second round.
As it was, however, Jia was edged out in the final run by Oleksandr Abramenko of Ukraine, whose victory stunned viewers, as he was relatively unknown despite competing in his fourth edition of the Games. It was Ukraine’s third gold medal at the Winter Games since it began competing independently in 1994 and its first medal of any color in freestyle skiing. Jia settled for second, while Russian Ilya Burov took home bronze.

Johnson was disqualified, with the gold medal going to Lewis, Christie getting a silver, and Calvin Smith moving into the medals with a bronze. As always, Johnson denied that he had ever taken performance-enhancing drugs (PEDs), although by 1988 he looked as if somebody had put an air hose in his mouth and turned it on. Later that year the Canadian government began an inquiry into the use of drugs in Canadian sports, termed the Dubin Inquiry, after presiding Judge Charles Dubin. In that inquiry, Johnson eventually admitted to the long-term use of steroids, and this was confirmed by his doctor, Jamie Astaphan, and coach, Charles Francis. Johnson was suspended for two years but did return to compete internationally in the early 90s and also participated in the 1992 Olympics.

Winkler’s mount Halla, a bay mare, would follow him to the 1960 Olympics and win a team gold there, in addition to his two jumping golds in Stockholm, as Halla became the first horse to win three Olympic gold medals. Halla was by a trotting stallion and was foaled on 16 May 1945. She competed through the Brussels Grand Prix on 25 October 1960 and then was retired to stud, later dying in 1979, at 34-years-old.

It not only marked the return of catamarans and mixed events after a break in 2012, but was also the first time that the crew had to consist of one woman and one man. Previous mixed events just opened the entry list for both sexes with the men outnumbering the women by far. In this new class, the hero of the day was Argentinian Santiago Lange, a six times Olympian and bronze medal winner in the discontinued Tornado class in 2004 and 2008. Not only was he 54 years old when he became the oldest medal winner in Rio, but one year earlier he was diagnosed lung cancer and had his left lung removed. Lange, who is also a member of the Sweden-based 2017 America’s Cup crew, teamed up with 27-year-old Cecilia Carranza. Lange’s sons Yago and Klaus represented Argentina in the 49er class.
Even though Carranza and Lange were in the lead by five points after the preliminaries, ahead of Italy’s Vittorio Bissaro and Silvia Sicouri and another two points ahead of Austria’s Thomas Zajac and Tanja Frank the medal positions were still in doubt. Two more boats were also in reach of a medal: Australia with Jason Waterhouse and Lisa Darmanin and New Zealand with Jason Saunders and Gemma Jones. A penalty at the start put the Argentinian boat to the back of the field, but they recovered and advanced to sixth place at the finish line outperforming their Italian rivals by one place, and by just seven seconds, which proved to be decisive. Eventually, the medal hopefuls Italy dropped to fifth place overall. The other three leading catamarans from Austria, Australia and New Zealand occupied the top three positions in the medal race. But with New Zealand coming in first, Australia in second and Austria in third, they all came close but none close enough. Argentina survived with 77 points holding on to a lead of just one point ahead of Australia and Austria, both with 78 points. Australia was awarded silver and Austria bronze based on finishing positions in the medal race. The three medal winners were separated by one point and the first five teams by seven, the tightest final score of the 2016 sailing events only matched by the women’s windsurfing.

It is therefore strange that this event was only contested once at the Olympics, in 1924. The format used in the 1924 Olympics differs from the one currently used, as it used a point-for-place scoring system. Of note, the positions were those of the skaters who actually finished all four distances. This could make for interesting team tactics, with skaters deciding to forfeit or continue in spite of a bad position to help their countrymen (or hinder their opponents).
No such tactics were necessary at the 1924 Games, however. Because Jewtraw and Olsen were not entered in the allround competition, the lead was taken by Clas Thunberg and Roald Larsen. With Thunberg taking gold in both the 5000 and 1500 m, the title was virtually certain to go to the Finn. The difference with Larsen after three races was three points, which was not impossible because of Thunberg’s 10000 m record. The Finnish double victory in that event did seal it for Thunberg, while victor Skutnabb also secured a bronze in the allround competition.

Germany had won the gold medal at Berlin in 1936, but was not present at London in 1948, barred because of its war record.
The competition was remarkably close, with Finland winning the gold medal over Switzerland by only 1.60 points – 1,358.30 to 1,356.70. Hungary was a distant third to win the bronze medal, while France was well back in fourth. Finland was led by the individual gold medalist, Veikko Huhtanen, with another team member, Heikki Savolainen, competing in his fourth Olympics, and he would return again in 1952, eventually winning nine Olympic medals. Another Finn, Einari Teräsvirta, had also competed in 1932 and 1936. The Swiss had four of the top six individual performers, but the consistency of the Finnish team brought them the gold medal. They were led by Walter Lehmann, silver medalist in the individual all-around. The final scoring member for Switzerland was Michael Reusch, who won two silver medals at Berlin in 1936, and three apparatus gold medals at the 1938 World Championships.

She had also become World All-round Champion in 2009, and won the European title in 2007 and 2010. Two of Sáblíková’s expected top opponents were not in medal contention. Claudia Pechstein, the 2002 champion, had been suspended for illegal blood values at the 2009 World Championships. Since she had not actually been caught using doping, Pechstein had fought this suspension right up to the Olympics at several courts, but without success. Two-time silver medallist and reigning World Champion Renate Groenewold was competing in Richmond, but her season had been plagued by injuries and she had even considered not going to the Games after a poor showing at the Dutch Olympic Trials.
The first medal contender to skate, Sáblíková laid down a very consistent race, with 31-second laps for all but the final lap. Her 4:02.53 turned out to be too fast for the rest of the field. German Stephanie Beckert, who had twice beaten Sáblíková during World Cup races earlier in the season, fought out a close duel with Kristina Groves, but both remained out of reach. Beckert trailed Groves for nearly the entire race, but powered past the Canadian with her trademark fast final lap.

In the next edition of the Championships in 1932, the Alpine Combined was introduced as a new event, combining the results from downhill and slalom. The IOC decided to include Alpine Combined in the Winter Olympic program in 1936 for both sexes, the first skiing event for women in the winter games. The downhill event for both women and men was held on the first day of the games, and a crowd of 40,000 gathered around the finishing area at the slopes of the mountain Kreuzjoch. The ladies course had a length of 3,300 m. and a fall of 820 m.
The German Christl Cranz was the heavy favorite. She had won gold in the combination in the World Championships in both 1934 and 1935 and was the big star of the strong German team, which also included Lisa Resch (silver at the 1934 World Championships) and Käthe Grasegger (bronze in 1935). Like the fourth girl on the German team Hadi Pfeifer, both Resch and Grasegger were competing on home ground, they all represented the local ski club.
Resch took an early lead, and after 12 women had finished, the German girls had the four best times, to the great satisfaction of the home crowd. But the 16-year old Norwegian school girl Laila Schou Nilsen, unknown to the alpine skiing world, shocked the audience. Wearing start number 16, she crossed the finishing line in a time 4 seconds better than Resch. Laila Schou Nilsen was until then only known in speed skating circles. She had won the unofficial World Championships at Oslo in 1935 when only 15 years old, and was also a promising cross country skier. Since her favorite sport was not held at the Olympics for women, Laila started to train in alpine skiing, and surprised the Norwegians by winning the national selection races and qualified for the games as the youngest member of the Norwegian team.
The slalom event for ladies was held the day after the downhill, and the same course, with a length of 600 m. and with 23 gates, was skied in both rounds, with a descent of 200 m.  In the first round the young Norwegian spoiled her chances for a gold medal by receiving a penalty of 6 seconds for missing one of the gates. Cranz was an excellent slalom skier and was in a class of her own in both rounds, as she won a convincing gold. Her total slalom time was 11.3 seconds faster than the second best, teammate Grasegger, who advanced to silver position. Nilsen skied a good race in the second round and was only beaten by Cranz, thereby winning a most unexpected Olympic bronze medal for the Norwegians.
Christl Cranz continued her skiing career until 1941, and eventually won 12 world titles, the most in the history of the World Alpine Championships. The multi-talented Nilsen went back to speed skating for a period, winning the world championships both in 1937 and 1938.  In 1937 at Davos she crushed the world records at all distances, and, of course, also in total points. During her career she won 4 national titles in speed skating, 10 in alpine skiing, 74(!) in tennis (her tennis career lasted from 1937 to 1961), and 4 in handball, in addition to 12 matches for the national handball team. She also competed in the Monte Carlo Rally four times. Her administrative career included 4 years as vice president in the Norwegian Olympic Committee (1969-73).

In eight of the previous 11 years Markus Prock of Austria had won the World Cup overall title by accumulating the most points in a season but only once in the nineties had he beat reigning Olympic champion Georg Hackl of Germany in a major championship. Their rivalry was a classic duel between Prock, the natural talent, and the relentless Hackl whose concentration levels were legendary.
The younger generation of lugers was represented by 24-year-old Armin Zöggeler who had won the 1995 World Championships. Zöggeler had been the star of the season before Nagano and surprisingly Hackl had not won any of the six races before the Olympics.
Hackl arrived in Japan with a secret weapon in the shape of a pair of aerodynamically enhanced boots but even if the boots did give him an advantage it would be hard to deny that sheer talent won him the title. In fact Hackl’s most dangerous opponent was probably the jury of appeal but a complaint against the legality of his new boots by the North American teams was dismissed. The German was remarkably consistent and won all four runs each time recording a time over a tenth of a second faster than his rivals. Zöggeler and 1988 champion Jens Müller completed the podium with Markus Prock some distance behind them in fourth.

Italy won a close final in an Olympic record 4:37.4. They were led by Leandro Faggin. Faggin had already won three World Championship medals, including the amateur sprint title in 1954. As a professional, he would win the World Championships in the individual pursuit in 1963, 1965, and 1966, and also won gold in Melbourne in the kilometer. The British Olympic Report noted that he coached the team from the saddle and did all the pulls on the crucial laps. The other leading member of the Italian team was Valentino Gasparella who would become World Champion in the sprint in 1958-59.

Great Britain won the bronze medal, their sixth consecutive bronze in team pursuit, a streak that would end in 1960 when they did not make the quarter-finals. Britain’s best known rider was Tom Simpson, later a top professional who was World Champion on the road in 1965, and during his career won the Ronde de Vlaanderen, Paris-Bordeaux, Milan-San Remo, the Giro di Lombardia, and Paris-Nice. But Simpson is best known as the man who forced sports administrators into instituting doping controls. On the 13th stage of the 1967 Tour de France, while ascending Mont Ventoux, he collapsed and died. He was later found to be doped to the gills with amphetamines and alcohol. The furor over this finding helped convince the IOC to begin drug testing at the 1968 Olympics.

Du Toit had represented her nation at the age of 14 but lost a leg in a motorcycle accident in 2001. She came to world attention by winning five titles at the 2004 Paralympic Games then in 2008 qualified for the Olympic Games by placing 4th at the World Championships.

She did not compete in the 2003/2004 season, when she became a mother. After missing Olympic glory in 2002, she trained for the 2006 Games by projecting the course on a screen in her living room while lying down on her sled on a table. This unorthodox method paid off, and she dominated the first run at Cesana Pariol, taking a huge lead of more than half a second, and remained unchallenged in the second descent. The silver medal went to Britain’s Shelley Rudman, which was something of an upset. Rudman had started competing in skeleton after watching Alex Coomber winning a bronze in 2002, but had not been named for a top position in Torino. She edged out Mellisa Hollingsworth-Richards, winner of that season’s World Cup and 2004 World Champion Diane Sartor.

In the first leg, Soviet Union’s Ivan Utrobin started extremely fast, after 6 km he had a lead by around one minute, but then he faded badly. Finland’s Väinö Huhtala caught Utrobin just before the exchange  and finished with a six seconds lead with Norway’s Magnar Lundemo in third position another six seconds back. Sweden and Italy were still in contention in fourth and fifth position.
On the second leg, Finland’s Arto Tiainen was struggeling and overtaken by four other teams. At the exchange Soviet Union’s Gennady Vaganov had the lead, 12 seconds ahead of Norway. The fastest man on the second leg was Italy’s Marcello De Dorigo who brought his team into third position, gaining 21 seconds on the leading Soviet team. Sweden’s Sixten Jernberg could not hold off the Italian, but passed Finland  and was still in fourth place, 10 seconds behind Italy.
On the third leg Igor Voronchikhin was able to hold off Norway’s Einar Østby, who was 12 seconds behind at the exchange. Italy dropped down to fifth position almost two minutes behind the leading team, but Finland and Sweden was still fighting for the gold. Finland’s Kalevi Lauria had the fastest leg time and caught the Swede Janne Stefansson at the exchange, both teams 32 seconds behind Soviet Union.
The anchor leg developed into a very close battle between Sweden’s Assar Rönnlund and the double Olympic Champion Eero Mäntyranta. They soon passed Norway’s Harald Grønningen and one kilometer from home they caught the leading Soviet team. Pavel Kolchin was not able to follow, and in the final stages Rönnlund went away from Mäntyranta. Sweden won, eight seconds ahead of Finland, with the Soviet Union another four seconds back. Norway finished fourth, over two minutes ahead of Italy. It was a great victory for Sweden, and Sixten Jernberg ended his great Olympic career with his fourth gold medal and a total of nine Olympic medals.

There were several contenders considered before the race, but Armstrong was not among them. Sweden’s Anders Holmertz had won the 1987 Europeans, while Groß was the 1986 World Champion. Groß still held the world record, set when he won the 1984 Olympic gold medal. American Matt Biondi was formidable, but he was slightly better in the sprints.

But in August 2001, he was in a very serious motorcycle accident and doctors feared that they might have to amputate his leg. Able to save the leg with major reconstructive surgery, his ski career thought to be over, Maier would return to the World Cup circuit in January 2003. In his absence the best downhiller in 2001-02 was his teammate, Stephan Eberharter, who was leading the World Cup after winning five of eight races prior to the Winter Olympics. Eberharter went off as the ninth starter and took the lead with a time of 1:39.41. The next skier was another Austrian, Fritz Strobl, who was second in the 2001-02 World Cup standings. Strobl edged ahead of Eberharter with his 1:39.13. The biggest remaining challengers were the Norwegians, Lasse Kjus and Kjetil André Aamodt, but they could not better Strobl, who won the gold medal.

After the USA had make a strong start it was the performance of Australia’s individual breaststroke champion Leisel Jones that was to prove the difference between gold and silver. Whilst the silver medal winning Americans recorded better times on three of the four legs this could not make up for the 1.4 seconds that Jones pulled out over Rebecca Soni. In a fitting finale to the women’s programme both teams were comfortably under the pre-existing world record. China broke the Asian record in 3rd whilst Great Britain’s European record for 4th meant that 4 continental records fell in the final.

Still only 26, he was expected to increase his medal collection in the 1984 Olympics. But in 1983 his wife Sylvia died after a sudden illness, and Ullrich announced that he would retire from top sport. However, he was persuaded to return for another season and reluctantly agreed, but his preparations for the 1984 Olympics were surely affected by his wife’s death.
As usual, the 20 km race was the opening biathlon event in the 1984 Winter Olympics. After the first round of shooting, the new biathlon star from East Germany, 19-year old Frank-Peter Roetsch was in the lead. Roesch had won the silver medal behind Ullrich at the 1983 World Championship. In second place after the first shooting round was Peter Angerer of West Germany, who had won the bronze medal behind Roetsch at the 1983 World Championship. On the second series of shots, Roetsch was penalized two minutes and dropped down to sixth, putting Angerer in the lead. After the third shooting round the situation changed again. Jan Matouš, a 22-year old unmerited Czech, had taken over the lead, five seconds ahead of Angerer and Roetsch back in medal position in third. At the final set of targets the Norwegian Erik Kvalfoss, world sprint champion from 1982 and 1983, and the fastest skier of the day, took an early lead. Matouš missed four targets and was out of the fight for medals. Then Roetsch missed one target, but was one minute ahead of Kvalfoss when he left for the final 2.5 km to the finish. Of the late starters, only Angerer was expected to compete with Roetsch’s time, and he did. After a perfect standing shooting round he was over a minute ahead of his East German competitor, and easily secured the first ever Olympic biathlon gold medal for West Germany. Roetsch had no problems taking the silver medal ahead of fast finishing Kvalfoss. Ullrich was far from his former self, usually one of the fastest skiers, he lost three minutes to Kvalfoss in skiing time and had to be content with fifth place, behind Frenchman Yvon Mougel, who improved from sixth in 1980 to fourth in 1984.

Although Chen was considered the favourite there was still intrigue into how Hanyu would perform in defence of his title especially if he was injury free this time.  Sadly the Japanese star suffered an injury in his right ankle ligament during a fall in practice in November 2021 and struggled to recover his fitness in time for Beijing. Hanyu’s defence was doomed from the moment in the short program where he messed up his opening quadruple Salchow jump and his hopes were over when he only finished eighth after the first phase of competition.
In contrast, Chen exceeded expectations with a virtuoso short program and nailed all of his jumps on his way to a world best score that gave him the lead over the Japanese pairing of Yuma Kagiyama and Shoma Uno.
Revisiting the long program he had intended to skate at the cancelled 2020 World Championships, Chen’s execution was not perfect but it was enough to extend his winning margin over Kagiyama and Uno further.

Already a surprising 3rd after one heat in the 500 m, Zhang was feared for her fast laps, which often “compensated” for her poor starts. Nevertheless, she had already won two medals at the World Sprint Championships, including a silver behind the now injured Yu Jing several weeks before the Olympics. In her Olympic 1,000 m, Zhang started well, and her first lap was unrivalled at 27.09. Combined with a closing lap that only one skater would better (28.99), this gave her an amazing 1:14.02, just narrowly slower than Richardson’s lowland world record. Pair after pair failed to approach it. Only in the 16th pair did Margot Boer and Fatkulina seriously attack Zhang’s time. The Russian opened faster and had a great first lap to lead Zhang’s time by 2 tenths at the bell. But Fatkulina paid dearly for her fast start, and lost all of her advantage in the last 200 m, as she also saw Margot Boer pass her. The Dutch racer, 3rd in the 500 m, recorded 1:14.90, which would eventually earn her a second bronze medal. Wüst fought off Bowe with the best final lap of the field to get to 1:14.69, the second best time of the day. Eagerly awaiting the final pair in the inner field, Zhang Hong celebrated China’s first Olympic gold medal in speed skating ever, after three silver and three bronze medals.

Since her appearance in the Olympic 5,000 m of Calgary (1988), in which she placed 7th despite a fall, Niemann had not lost an international 5,000 m. She had won the distance at the 1989, 1991, 1992 and 1993 World Championships, the 1989-1994 Europeans, the 1992 Olympics, and in 8 World Cup events. To top off the list, she had obtained her latest World Cup victory on in Hamar in December 1993 by improving her own world record to 7:13.29.
As in the other Olympic events, things did not go Niemann’s way. First, her team mate, Claudia Pechstein set a surprisingly fast time. While a bronze medallist in 1992 and in the 1994 3,000 m, she had been ill earlier in the season, and with 7:33.58, her 5,000 m personal best was 20 seconds behind the world record. But after a very steady race, Pechstein’s time was 7:14.37, only a second from Niemann’s best. The next race, a second racer beat 7:20. It was Hiromi Yamamoto of Japan. Despite being the Asian champion in the event, she was virtually unknown. Her only pre-Olympic feat had been a second place in the 3,000 m at a January World Cup, although that competition lacked several top skaters. Her time of 7:19.68 would be enough for bronze. Niemann raced in pair six, and started off very fast. For 3,800 m, she was below her own world record schedule. But with lap times increasing, that time fell out of sight, while the gap with Pechstein’s splits got smaller. At 4,600 m, Niemann was one tenth slower than her team mate, and the gap grew even further to half a second in the final lap. Pechstein’s gold medal would turn out to be the first of three consecutive titles in the event for her, winning two more in 1998 and 2002. In 1992, she also won a bronze medal, and in 2006 Pechstein finished second, making for a total of 5 medals in the 5,000 m.
Of the other competitors, it appeared that Italian Elena Belci would be unable to compete. Like Niemann, she had been disqualified in the 3,000 m, and new rules required a place among the best 16 of the 3,000 m for starting places in the 5,000 m. After Poland and Romania forfeited a spot in favor of Italy, unsubstantiated rumors appeared of bribes by the Italians. Belci, considered a potential medalist, eventually finished fourth.

He led the qualifying, and then had a clean round in the first round of the final, tied with three other riders. Unfortunately, in round two, his horse, Baloubet du Rouet, balked and refused three times at obstacle seven, eliminating the pair.
This allowed two of the riders who had gone clean in round one, Jeroen Dubbeldam (NED) and Khaled Al-Eid (KSA) to tie with a total of 4.00 faults, joined by another Dutch rider, Albert Voorn, who had a clean ride in round two. The three jumped off to decide the medal and Dubbeldam again went clear to win the gold medal. Both Voorn and Al-Eid had four faults, but Voorn won the silver based on time, 44.72 to 44.86.

They had won 24 world titles since the championships’ inception in 1959, with the next most successful, the USA, having taken just four.
Canada eased into the semi-finals with a 6-1 record, their only loss coming when they had already secured a place in the last four. Norway and Switzerland also qualified comfortably for the semis but the fourth qualifier, the American team, had to win two tie-breaker games to reach the medal games. The two semi-finals were contrasting; Canada took an early lead against the USA and pulled away for an easy 7-1 victory whilst the Switzerland-Norway match came down to the final end where the game was decided by a single point to the Swiss.

Her performance had been somewhat uneven in the years since her victory, however, and she had experienced a serious crash just four months prior to the Games that nearly took her out of contention. The favorite, therefore, was probably Sandra Näslund of Sweden, the 2017 World Champion who had been having an excellent season in the lead up to the Olympics. Austria’s Andrea Limbacher, the 2015 World Champion, who would be competing in her third Olympics, was certainly a podium contender as well.
Canada claimed the top three spots in the seeding round, with Thompson in front, followed by Kelsey Serwa and Brittany Phelan. Serwa had been the runner-up at the 2014 Games and had captured the gold medal at the 2016 Winter X Games, but a serious training accident had nearly ended her career in December of 2016. Phelan, on the other hand, was somewhat of an oddity, as she had competed in the 2014 Olympics as an alpine skier, but had switched to freestyle skiing following a series of injuries in 2015. Näslund was still certainly in contention as well, as she finished only 0.02 seconds behind Phelan.
Each round of the ski cross was divided into heats of three competitors, with the top two advancing. Of the favorites, Thompson was the only one not to win her heat, or even survive, in the first round, as she crashed after her skis hit those of another competitor. A similar fate befell Limbacher in the quarterfinals and, while Näslund advanced, she did so only by coming in second to Switzerland’s Fanny Smith, the 2013 World Champion, 2017 runner-up, and 2015 bronze medalist. It was the two remaining Canadians, along with Näslund and Smith, who then advanced to the final. Serwa started off the race strong and never relented, capturing the gold medal and ensuring that the title would remain with the Canadians for the next four years. Näslund was close behind at first, but eventually surrendered her position to Phelan, and then Smith, who ended up taking silver and bronze respectively, leaving the event’s favorite off the podium.

He had fought at the 1982 World Championships, which were won by American Tyrell Biggs, but the Cuban suffered a rare loss in the quarter-finals to Italy’s Francesco Damiani. With Stevenson not available because of the Soviet-led boycott, this division was effectively a junior varsity tournament. But that did not stop Biggs, who won the gold medal, defeating Damiani in the final. Biggs had also beaten Canada’s Lennox Lewis in the quarter-finals, but Lewis would return in 1988 to win the Olympic gold medal and go on to become world professional heavyweight champion for various organizations from 1992-2003. Damiani also turned professional and won the WBO world heavyweight crown (1989-91), defeating Biggs in 1988 in a re-match. Biggs professional career never amounted to much. He fought Mike Tyson in 1987 for the world title, but got hammered, losing by TKO in the seventh, and Tyson said he carried him so he could inflict more damage because he did not like Biggs. Biggs retired after 1998 with a pro record of 30-10. In 1986 Teófilo Stevenson won the World Championship for a third time, and then retired.

It was changed slightly in 1992 when the five best scores on each apparatus routine, compulsory and optional, were used for the team scores. In 1996, teams were allowed seven gymnasts, choosing six to compete on each apparatus, with the five best scores counting towards the team score. The Soviet Union had dominated this event since 1952, winning every year except 1984 when they boycotted, including 1992 as the Unified Team. Russia was now the remnant of that gymnastics power but this was expected to be a four-way battle between Russia, Romania, China, and the United States.
Russia led after the compulsories but two nights later the Americans took a lead of 0.897 points after three rotations of the optionals. Romania was also very close but after the third rotation out of the gold medal chase, while China was mired back in fourth. On the fourth rotation, the vault for the United States, Dominique Moceanu, missed two consecutive vaults, scoring 9.2. The final American was Kerri Strug, who was a vault specialist, but she landed poorly on her first attempt, scoring only 9.162, and what was worse, felt something tear in her left ankle. Strug did not think she could take her second attempt, but she was urged on by her teammates and coach, Bela Karolyi, who told her, “We need a 9.6.”
Strug took the final vault, landed, hopped slightly on her one good leg, but otherwise was clean, and scored a 9.712, clinching the gold medal for the US. The diminutive gymnast was seen a few minutes later being carried around the arena by Karolyi, while she was wearing a protective boot. Strug became a national heroine in the US, as US television played up the dramatics. Unfortunately, the story was better than the reality. Without Strug taking the final vault, the US would still have won the competition by 0.309 points.

At the three United States Olympic Trials, Ira Courtney won the western trial, Clement Wilson the central and Howard Drew the eastern trial.  In the eastern meet, Ralph Craig finished second to Drew.  The world record for 100 metres was 10.5, shared by three Germans, Richard Rau, Erwin Kern, and Emil Ketterer.  All three competed at Stockholm, but Ketterer did not finish in round one, and Rau and Kern were eliminated in the semi-finals.
In the first round, America’s Donald Lippincott broke the Olympic record in heat 16 with a 10.6 clocking.  The six semi-finals advanced only the winner of each heat to the final.  Five of the finalists were from the United States - Ralph Craig, Howard Drew, Alvah Meyer, Frank Belote, and Lippincott.  The fastest times in the semis were 10.7, posted by both Craig and Meyer.
The final began without Drew, who had strained a muscle at the finish of his semi-final heat and could not start.  The final was marked by multiple false starts - listed as six, seven, or eight in various sources.  After one of the false starts, Craig and Lippincott ran the entire 100 metres.  Craig noted many years later, “There were seven false starts, and I made one of them.  Another American who had competed in the Paris Games - those 1900 Games were kind of horrendous, you know - he told me if you ever get to the Olympics, if anyone moves a muscle, you go too.  Don Lippincott and I ran the whole hundred meters on one false start.  The foreign officials were totally incompetent, and I was afraid not to keep running even though they fired the recall gun.  I was told, don’t take a chance - go! - so I did.  They did fire the recall gun, but I didn’t believe it.”
After the false starts, Patching took the early lead but he was eventually defeated by three Americans, with Craig winning narrowly.  Craig would later make the 1948 Olympic team as a yachtsman, and he carried the U.S. flag at the 1948 Opening Ceremony, but he was only an alternate and did not actually compete at the 1948 London Olympics.

But that theory omitted one variable – the United States center was a gentleman named Bill Russell.
Russell played at the University of San Francisco, where he led his team to the NCAA title in 1955 and 1956.  A 6-9 center (206 cm.) with very long arms, he emphasized defense and team play and would eventually be considered the greatest champion in the history of American basketball, leading his NBA team, the Boston Celtics, to 10 NBA Championships, eight of them consecutively.  He was assisted by the guard, K. C. Jones, who played throughout his career with Russell, at San Francisco, on the Olympic team, and later with the Boston Celtics.
During the Olympics, the United States’ team was dominant.  They won every game by over 30 points, including the final against the Soviet Union by 89-55.

French hopes were dashed in the quarter-finals. Daniel Daney appeared to have outboxed his Belgian opponent but Joseph Beecken was awarded the victory. A last round in which the Frenchman briefly touched the canvas might have influenced the judges.
The favourite for the competition was though to be the reigning champion, Harry Mallin from Britain, and Mallin did indeed win his first two bouts without any great alarm. In the last eight he came up against another French fighter in Roger Brousse. Mallin appeared to most onlookers to have won the contest but Brousse was declared the victor by a 2-1 decision. By this time Mallin had already approached the referee and asked for him to examine teeth marks on his chest and whilst the referee had ignored him, the damage had been seen by a ringside official.
A Swedish member of the Fédération Internationale de Boxe Amateur (FIBA) filed a protest and an inquiry was held. Mallin’s chest was examined and it was proved that he had clearly been bitten. Brousse’s defence was that he had an unusual habit of snapping his jaw at the moment of throwing a punch and that Mallin, in defending himself against Brousse’s punches, had bumped his chest against his opponent’s mouth. The witnesses against Brousse included the Argentine he had defeated in his previous bout, who also accused the Frenchman of biting.  Whilst the jury of appeal cleared Brousse of an intentional foul, they still disqualified him and advanced Mallin to the semi finals.
The announcement of Brousse’s late disqualification was made at the boxing venue the day after the bout took place and led to scenes of uproar in the hall. A distraught Brousse was carried on the shoulders of his supporters around the arena, demonstrators attempted to enter the ring and even after the gendarmes had restored some sort of order, the officials were the subject of abuse for the rest of the night.
Mallin came through his semi-final and in the final met his fellow Londoner, Jack Elliott.  With the events of the welterweight final having left the arena already in turmoil, the sight of Mallin merely entering the ring set off a chorus of booing amongst the French supporters. Mallin did not fight to his usual standard but was good enough to outpoint Elliott and become the first boxer to successfully defend an Olympic title. The Olympic final was to be the final bout for the 32 year old champion; he retired having never lost a senior contest.  He later served as manager of the British boxing team at both the Berlin and Helsinki games.

The winners in 1905-06 had been a four representing the Leander Club, so the final of this event brought the two top fours from Britain over the past few years. European championships in this era were only held for coxed fours, and Belgian and Italy dominated this class, but did not enter for the Olympics.
In the final, the Magdalen four opened at 38 strokes and was a length ahead at the half-way point. The Oxonian crew gradually increased their lead to win by a margin described variously as 1 or 2 lengths.
The silver and bronze medalists listed below are controversial. It seems likely that only gold medals, and no silver or bronze medals, were given. The rules, as given in the 1908 Official Report (p. 528), note, “The Winners or Winner of the events will each receive the British Olympic Council’s Gold Medal for the Olympic Games of 1908.”  And on another page of the 1908 Official Report (p. 37), one finds under Rowing, “Prizes: - Gold Olympic Medals to the winners in each Event.”  There is no mention of silver or bronze medals in either place. In the results section of the 1908 Official Report (p. 358). the four rowing events are listed, with only the winners listed under gold medals. No silver or bronze medal placements are listed.
Because of the set-up of the Henley course, only two crews or sculls competed at any one time. Thus the semi-finals and finals consisted of only two crews or single scullers. Certainly the losing finalist would seem to be considered the “silver medalist” although we do not know if those rowers actually received such a medal. In addition, it would seem natural, and consistent with other Olympic sports with head-to-head formats, such as boxing and tennis, to consider the losing semi-finalists as “bronze medalists.”
Olympic statisticians vary on the listing of these results. Erich Kamper, in Encyclopaedia of the Olympic Games, listed the losing semi-finalists in the single sculls and eights as finishing third, but he did not list the losing semi-finalists that way in the coxed pairs or coxed fours. Both Volker Kluge (Die Olympischen Spiele von 1896 bis 1980) and David Wallechinsky (The Complete Book of the Summer Olympics) consider all the losing semi-finalists as finishing in 3rd place. But in his more recent book, Olympische Sommerspiele: Die Chronik I, Kluge did not describe the losing semi-finalists as bronze medalists.
However, in keeping with our Guidelines (see Updates–>Guidelines), we have considered the losing finalists as silver medalists (2nd place) and both the losing semi-finalists as bronze medalists (3rd place). In those guidelines we note, “we consider all participants being placed first, second or third in the final standings to have received gold, silver or bronze medals respectively.”

He would also compete in 1948, setting a record with a 40-year span of Olympic appearances that was not bettered until the 2012 Olympics when Japanese equestrian Hiroshi Hoketsu competed, 48 years after his appearance at the 1964 Tokyo Olympics.

Score based on compulsory and optional exercises on apparatus.",na,"This event was called free-handed exercises in both the 1932 Official Report and Program of Events. The floor exercises were carried out as a separate competition and were not part of the individual all-around, but were oddly conducted as a section of the team all-around, being noted as a Preliminary to the Team Competition in the Program of Events. Only participants competing in the team all-around could start in this event (with an exception noted below), although the score strangely did not count for the team all-around, either. Only one individual routine was performed.
The Swiss did not have a team, but Georges Miez received special permission to start and won the silver medal, beaten only by the Hungarian István Pelle, the silver medalist in the individual all-around. Bronze went to the Italian Mario Lertora.
Miez was the only Swiss participant in Los Angeles and in his four Olympic appearances from 1924-36 won four golds, three silvers and one bronze medal. In Los Angeles he considered his floor exercise scores very devalued, and resigned in anger from the competitions, after loudly confronting the judges with no success. He then embarked on a trip throughout the US, where he also worked and held speeches at universities. Nonetheless, with other Swiss gymnasts, Miez pointed the way ahead for the development of floor gymnastics, because the Swiss team introduced a flowing style of movement.

Ties broken by lightest bodyweight.,na,"China made up for not having a favorite in the women’s middleweight weightlifting event at the 2012 Summer Olympics by having two in the men’s version. The first was Lu Xiaojun, 2009 and 2011 World Champion, 2010 runner-up, 2011 Asian Champion, and 2008 runner-up. The other, Lu Haojie, was six years younger than his compatriot and a potential successor, having won the most recent Chinese National Championships. They would face a challenge, however, from defending Olympic Champion Sa Jae-Hyeok of South Korea, although his best finish in a major international event since had been third at the 2011 World Championships and the 2012 Asian Championships (the latter in the light-heavyweight category).
The field was whittled down before the event started, when Hysen Pulaku of Albania became the first participant of the Games to test positive for a banned substance and be removed from the festivities. Then Gevorg Davtyan of Armenia, 2008 Olympic bronze medalist, twice European Champion (2008, 2010) and once runner-up (2007), and 2010 World Champion and 2009 runner-up, failed the weigh-in and was withdrawn from the competition. Nearing the end of the snatch portion Sa, already in first place, tried to increase his lead with a lift of 162 kg, but dislocated his shoulder in the attempt and was unable to complete the event. Even a score of 158 kg would have been sufficient to remain in third place, but it would have been nowhere near the massive lifts of Lu Haojie and Lu Xiaojun, who had scored 170 and 175 kg respectively, and the latter of whom broke his own world record by 1 kilogram. There was confusion in the snatch with Lu Haojie waving his third attempt and Lu Xiaojun not realizing that his teammate had done so, thereby failing to appear for his third lift (which would have been an attempt at 177 kg).
Chatuphum Chinnawong of Thailand’s third-place lift of 157 kg meant that the Chinese competitors were essentially untouchable on the podium. Lu Haojie lifted 190 kg in his first attempt to take an early lead, and was followed in this feat by Iván Cambar of Cuba, winner of the event at the last two Pan American Games. Chinnawong moved into second place by lifting 191 kg while Lu Haojie, aiming to try that weight in his next attempt, was unable to continue after suffering a wrist injury on his previous lift. Lu Haojie would remain in contention, however, having posted one successful score in the clean and jerk. Cambar’s next lift was a successful 194 kg, returning to second place, although still eleven points behind Lu Haojie. Lu Xiaojun then arrived with an opening 195 kg lift, giving him a total of 370 points, which guaranteed him the gold medal, as he was ten points ahead of his injured compatriot and twenty-one ahead of Cambar. Chinnawong attempted to lift the same weight and enter the bronze medal position, but failed in both attempts and remained in fourth. Ibrahim Ramadan of Egypt followed with an attempt at 197 kg, which would have put him three points ahead of Cambar and onto the podium, but was unsuccessful and forced to make due with fifth place. Cambar did not even bother to take his final attempt, settling for bronze, while Lu Xiaojun used has last two turns to lift 204 kg and best his own world record for total points by one.

The battle for the silver medal was very close. East Germany and Czechoslovakia had almost the same time at the 25 km. checkpoint, but East Germany had opened up 23 seconds by the 75 km. interval. But the Czechs closed very quickly, and East Germany eventually won the silver medal by less than one second. With the American boycott, the race was almost an Eastern European championship.

Part of this can be explained by the absence due to pregnancy during part of this time by the Olympic champions of 2000 and 2004. Both Tímea Nagy and Laura Flessel-Colovic had taken time away from the sport to have babies with Flessel-Colovic’s progress also having been compromised by a positive drug test from an over-the-counter medication she was given by a team doctor.
The two former champions made their way to the final and although Nagy lost the first point she then gained control, opening up a three-point lead at 7-4 before easing towards a 15-10 victory and a successful defence of her gold medal. Nagy announced her retirement after her win but changed her decision and went on to win the 2006 world title. She failed to be selected to defend her title in Beijing and eventually retired for good in 2010.

They had won the European championship from 1906-1908 and a Belgian eight had won that title every year from 1897-1910 with the exception of 1905 and 1909. At Henley, the Royal Club Nautique de Gand won the Grand Challenge Cup (for eights) in 1906-07 and 1909. Leander Club had an eight win the Grand Challenge Cup in 1903-05, while the 1908 title went to an Oxford crew representing the Christ Church College Boat Club. The top American eight was the team from Vesper Boat Club in Philadelphia, which had won the Olympic championship in 1900 and 1904, but Vesper did not enter the 1908 Olympic rowing regatta.
The two favored crews came through to the final, although both had reasonable competition in the early rounds. Leander went out at 42 strokes and Gand at 43 strokes. Leander went ahead by -length as they passed Temple Island. Shortly after one mile, Gand pulled even and may have even led briefly but it was a futile effort which exhausted them. Leander pulled away easily after passing Phyllis Court and won by 2 lengths. All the members of the Leander crew had rowed for Oxford or Cambridge.
The silver and bronze medalists listed below are controversial. It seems likely that only gold medals, and no silver or bronze medals, were given. The rules, as given in the 1908 Official Report (p. 528), note, “The Winners or Winner of the events will each receive the British Olympic Council’s Gold Medal for the Olympic Games of 1908.”  And on another page of the 1908 Official Report (p. 37), one finds under Rowing, “Prizes: - Gold Olympic Medals to the winners in each Event.”  There is no mention of silver or bronze medals in either place. In the results section of the 1908 Official Report (p. 358). the four rowing events are listed, with only the winners listed under gold medals. No silver or bronze medal placements are listed.
Because of the set-up of the Henley course, only two crews or sculls competed at any one time. Thus the semi-finals and finals consisted of only two crews or single scullers. Certainly the losing finalist would seem to be considered the “silver medalist” although we do not know if those rowers actually received such a medal. In addition, it would seem natural, and consistent with other Olympic sports with head-to-head formats, such as boxing and tennis, to consider the losing semi-finalists as “bronze medalists.”
Olympic statisticians vary on the listing of these results. Erich Kamper, in Encyclopaedia of the Olympic Games, listed the losing semi-finalists in the single sculls and eights as finishing third, but he did not list the losing semi-finalists that way in the coxed pairs or coxed fours. Both Volker Kluge (Die Olympischen Spiele von 1896 bis 1980) and David Wallechinsky (The Complete Book of the Summer Olympics) consider all the losing semi-finalists as finishing in 3rd place. But in his more recent book, Olympische Sommerspiele: Die Chronik I, Kluge did not describe the losing semi-finalists as bronze medalists.
However, in keeping with our Guidelines (see Updates–>Guidelines), we have considered the losing finalists as silver medalists (2nd place) and both the losing semi-finalists as bronze medalists (3rd place). In those guidelines we note, “we consider all participants being placed first, second or third in the final standings to have received gold, silver or bronze medals respectively.”

France’s Tess Ledeux and Russia’s Anastasiya Tatalina, the 2019 and 2021 World Champions respectively, were both veterans of the 2018 PyeongChang Olympics’ slopestyle event, with Ledeux also having won one of the two big air events held in the most recent World Cup season, among other distinctions. The other was won by American-born Chinese skier Eileen Gu, who had numerous medals to her name, including gold in this event from the 2020 Winter Youth Olympics. She was also the most recent World Champion in halfpipe and slopestyle, but had come in third in big air.
The qualifying round was led by Canadian Megan Oldham, who had been fourth in the most recent World Championships and taken bronze in the slopestyle. She was also runner-up behind Ledeux in big air at the 2022 Winter X Games, held at the end of January. In Beijing, Ledeux qualified in second, with Tatlina third, Norway’s Sandra Eie fourth, and Gu fifth. Eie would have disastrous first and second runs in the final, putting her out of contention for a medal.
Ledeux came out on top in the first round of the final, with Gu not far behind and Britain’s Kirsty Muir, the runner-up at the 2020 Winter Youth Olympics, in third. In the second run, Switzerland’s Mathilde Gremaud, the 2017, 2019, and 2021 Winter X Games champion, had a slightly better run than Ledeux, with Oldham further back in third. Gu’s second run went well, but in her third she pulled off a left double cork 1620 jump – which she had never performed in competition – and landed it successfully to match Ledeux’s score from the first round.
With Ledeux’s second-best score being lower than Gu’s, Gu became the youngest Chinese Winter Olympic champion, while France would have to settle for silver. Gremaud’s third run was unsuccessful, but Oldham was unable able to make up the difference in points, giving Switzerland bronze. Muir’s poor second and third runs left her in fifth, while Tatalina did not have a good final at all, ultimately placing tenth.

Cao’s mother had died shortly before the Beijing Olympics, but she was not told of this during training by her coaches, so as not to distract her.
Chile’s Elizabeth Poblete finished 12th and last, 85 kg behind Cao. In 2009 she was training and strained to complete a lift, only to suddenly deliver a baby boy. She had not been feeling well, but was not aware she was pregnant at the time. Unfortunately, the baby lived only a few days.
That was how the event and the results seemed to have ended. In 2015, however, the IOC began re-testing samples from the 2008 Beijing and 2012 London Olympics, using newer, more advanced testing techniques, in an effort to find those who had used performance enhancing drugs (PEDs), but in whom it could not be detected at the time of those Olympics. This was one of the many events affected. Of note, every women’s weightlifting event from the 2008 Beijing Olympics was affected by positive re-tests for PEDs.
This event’s results were ravaged with 4 of 12 competitors affected. Testing positive were the gold medalist, Cao Lei of China; the bronze medalist Nadezhda Yevstyukhina of Russia; the original fourth-place finisher, Irina Kulesha of Belarus; and also the 11th-place finisher, Hripsime Khurshudyan of Armenia.
Yevstyukhina and Kulesha tested positive for turinabol (dehydrochloromethyltestosterone), with Yevstyukhina also having supplemental erythropoietin (EPO) found. Khurshudyan tested positive for another anabolic steroid, stanozolol, while Cao tested positive for GHRP-2, a form of growth hormone releasing peptide. In early 2019 it was announced that the original silver medalist Alla Vazhenina was moved up to the gold medal, with Spain’s Lidia Valentin receiving a silver medal, and Mexico’s Damaris Gabriela Aguirre a bronze medal. Valentin also moved up to a gold medal in this event at the 2012 Olympics, after further drug re-test disqualifications, and then won a gold medal outright in the event in 2016.

In the heavyweight class he finished 6th and last in that event.
There is some confusion over the third place in this event. The match between Meyer and Nilsson ended in a draw. Official regulations mention that a judge should pick a winner in such case, but apparently this did not occur. Contemporary sources contradict each other and themselves on whether these wrestlers were ranked third or fourth. Notably, both the Official Report and the US Olympic Committee Report list them as third in one place, yet as fourth in another.

It was a risky move because Kenny had never defeated the favorite, France’s Grégory Baugé. Baugé had earned the individual World Championship title every year since the 2008 Olympics, although Kenny is credited with the victory in 2011 because Baugé received a backdated suspension for missing doping tests.  Furthermore, Baugé was a member of five World Championship-winning team sprint squads although, as with the individual, he had to surrender his 2011 victory. Kenny, on the other hand, earned team sprint gold in Beijing (and repeated the feat in London) and would certainly have the hometown advantage going into the event.
This support must have had some effect, for Kenny posted the fastest time in the qualification round, over two-tenths of a second faster than Baugé. In fact Baugé was outclassed by Kenny in every round of the competition and, by the time of the final, Kenny’s fellow Britons had packed the London Velopark to capacity to cheer him on. In both races, Baugé was unable to match Kenny’s raw power, allowing Kenny to successfully defend the Olympic title for his country and its dominance in 2012 cycling events.

But then France’s Jean Vuarnet, bronze medalist at the 1958 World Championships, came down, one of the first skiers to utilize the modern aerodynamic egg position, and he won the gold medal with his time of 2:06.0. Vuarnet also used metal skis, the first Olympic gold medalist to use what would become standard equipment until composite materials replaced metal. He later lent his name to a popular brand of sunglasses, Vuarnet Sunglasses. Vuarnet had married a French ski racer, Edith Bonlieu, and in 1994, she and their son, Patrick, were among those who participated in a mass suicide by members of the cult, the Order of the Solar Temple.

Five dives. Final round only.,na,"China had won every women’s synchronized platform gold medal since the event was introduced at the 2000 Sydney Olympics and the latest Chinse duo of Chen Yuxi and Zhang Jiaqi had a big reputation to maintain. The two girls came to the Tokyo Games as world champions. Cheng (aged 15) was the 2019 individual platform champion while 17-year-old Zhang was the synchronized platform champion that year, with Lu Wei.
At the Tokyo Aquatics Centre, they soon showed they were going to be a force to be reckoned with and led from the start and produced one stunning dive after another. They were top scorers after every dive and won the gold medal by a massive 52.98 points from the American pair of Jessica Parratto and Delaney Schnell, with the Mexicans Gabriela Agúndez and Alejandra Orozco in the bronze medal position. After two dives the Mexicans were lying sixth and seventh respectively, and the Mexican duo only snatched the bronze medal with their last dive from Matsuri Arai and Minami Itahashi of Japan, who dropped from third to sixth
Canada’s Meaghan Benfeito and Caeli McKay, who won the Diving World Cup at the Tokyo Aquatics Centre earlier in 2021, finished fourth, but were in a medal position after three rounds until a bad fourth round cost them dearly. They were attempting the toughest dive of the day, a back three-and-a-half somersaults, but it netted them only 51.48 points, the lowest score of the round. They made some ground on the Mexicans with their final dive but lost out on the bronze by just 0.54 points, and with it went Benfeito’s chance of winning a medal at three successive Games.
There was even bigger disappointment for Malaysia’s 2019 World Championships silver medallists, Leong Mun Yee and her partner Pandelela Rinong (who won silver in Rio), as they finished eighth and last in the fifth Olympics for each of them. After their first dive, however, they were just three points behind the Chinese duo and after two dives were still in a medal position, but a disastrous third dive saw them drop to seventh, from which they never recovered. Like Canada’s Meaghan Benfeito, Rinong also missed out on a third consecutive medal.

She was undefeated since Melbourne and would, in fact, win 140 consecutive high jump events between Melbourne and June 1967. Track historians consider her the most dominant single field event athlete in history, rivaled among track athletes only by Edwin Moses. She was a scissors jumper and when she used that technique to jump 1.73 (5-8) in Roma, she had the gold medal.

Kseniya Afanasyeva was second at the 2015 World Championships in Glasgow and was a member of the Russian team that took gold at the 2016 European Championships, but a kidney infection forced her to pull out of the Olympics a few weeks before they started.
The fourth gymnast to take to the floor was Amy Tinkler, the youngest member of he entire GB team in Rio, having turned 16 in October 2015. She overtook Wang Yan’s 14.666 to move into first place with a 14.933. Suddenly, a week after taking exams at school back in England, she was sitting in the gold medal position at the Olympic Games, but realistically she knew that, with Biles still to go, she wouldn’t hold on to it. Indeed it was the American to go next and, with a near flawless performance, saw a score of 15.966. Aly Raisman was the penultimate gymnast and she moved into second place with 15.500 and now Tinkler had an anxious wait to see if the Italian Ferrari, the last to perform, would deprive her of her bronze medal. Ferrari set off with a good routine and looked as though she would snatch the medal from the young British girl, but she slightly lost her balance at the end of her routine and a long deliberation by the judges scored her 0.167 of a point less than Tinkler, a memorable bronze for the 16-year-old. The day belonged to Simone Biles, however, as she overtook Shannon Miller as the most successful American gymnast with a total of 19 world and Olympic medals. She also became only the fifth woman to win four gymnastic gold medals at one Olympics after greats Larysa Latynina 1956, Ágnes Keleti 1956, Vêra Cáslavská 1968, and Ecaterina Szabo in 1984. Biles helped the United States to win eight of the 11 women’s medals it was possible to win in Rio.

On each loop, they ascended a slightly steep climb, and a series of switchbacks, just after the 6 km. point, and then ascended gently for the next 2½ km.  The course began on the Via Flaminia, turned left onto the Via Di Grottarossa, and then returned to the start along the Via Cassia. The race was started in tremendous heat (38º C/100º F). At least one cyclist, Korean No Do-Cheon, succumbed to the heat and had to be carried off to the hospital. The Danish team did not start the race after the death of their compatriot Knud Enemark Jensen in the team time trial.
East Germany’s Gustav-Adolf Schur had won the Amateur Road Race World Championship in both 1958 and 1959, the first rider ever to defend that title.  In 1960, the title went to his teammate, Bernhard Eckstein.  Both riders competed in Rome and Schur had to be favored, but he was marked closely and never figured in any breakaways.  The race began at 0900.  On the second lap, the Netherlands’ Lex van Kreuningen, broke away and opened up 46 seconds on the peloton by the fourth lap.  On lap five, he was joined by his teammate Jan Hugens, and they led together thru lap six.  On the next lap, seven other riders caught the Dutch tandem, to make a lead group of nine.  This group included Italy’s Livio Trapè, and the Soviet Union’s Viktor Kapitonov.  Over the next two laps a few other riders joined the leaders, but on lap 10, Trapè and Kapitonov went off the front together, and had 52 seconds on the peleton at the end of that circuit.  As the two neared the end of lap 11, Kapitonov took off and started a mad sprint, thinking the race was ending.  But they had one more lap to go, and the two entered it with a lead of 2:29.  At the finish, Kapitonov had enough left to repeat his sprint and narrowly defeat Trapè. This greatly disappointed the Italian crowd, who had hoped for an Italian win, which would have completed a sweep of the cycling events. A pack of 39 riders closed on the two leaders in the last lap, but finished 20 seconds down.  This group included Schur and Eckstein, and the entire German team was placed consecutively from 20-23 place.
The 1960 cycling road race has been a difficult event to document statistically as the Official Report lists only the 76 finishing riders. It mentions that there were 142 riders from 42 nations, but the other 66 riders are not listed directly.  There are some lap results that help identify the non-finishers.  We have been able to identify what we believe is the correct list of non-finishers by using various sources.  We have contacted numerous national cycling federations, asking for their information on their national riders.  In a few cases, we contacted some of the supposed competitors directly.  We finally found a copy of the Official Program from the day of the race, which listed the starters, and was accompanied by a list entitled “Entry Modifications,” which noted when some riders did not start and some were replaced by other riders on their teams.  We believe the results listed below are the best representation of who actually started on 30 August 1960. However, there are also problems with who actually finished the race in certain positions, based on personal reports from the riders, and photographs of the finish. We have footnoted these as necessary, but these results do not quite follow the results in the Official Report precisely.
Part of the problem may arise from the actions of the treasurer of the Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI), Albert Verougstraete, who was the judge at the finish line who was responsible for determining the final placements. But the Belgian judge listed the top 10 finishers and then left to have lunch, stating, “I’m hungry. I’ll issue a full list sometime tonight.”

There was no odds-on favorite for the 16th Olympic men’s giant slalom. Six of seven World Cup races were already held this winter and they had seen five different winners: Didier Cuche (Sölden), Carlo Janka (Beaver Creek), Massimiliano Blardone (Alta Badia), Ted Ligety (Kranjska Gora 1), and Marcel Hirscher (Val d’Isère, Kranjska Gora 2). The standings saw Ligety in the lead, followed by Blardone and Hirscher, who was the only racer to win two races in the current season and was also the last winner in Kranjska Gora about three weeks before the Olympics. Bode Miller, silver medalist in the 2002 giant slalom, who had already won a medal of each color in Vancouver, and Aksel Lund Svindal, with gold in the Super G and silver in the downhill, were considered podium candidates. The reigning world champion was Janka, who won gold in Val d’Isère 2009 with Benjamin Raich in second and Ligety in third. Raich (gold) was also the only medalist from Torino still competing as silver medalist Joël Chenal retired in 2009 and bronze medalist Hermann Maier retired just before the 2009-10 season. Only two World Cup giant slaloms had ever been held in Whistler. Ingemar Stenmark won there in 1975 while Hannes Reichelt won on 23 February 2008, but he did not qualify for this event in Vancouver.
Decided over two runs, the main surprise of the first run was the elimination of Miller, who missed a gate. At the end of the first run Janka was the leader with a time of 1:17.27, a mere 0.02 seconds ahead of Romed Baumann, Svindal 0.16 seconds back. So close was the run that less than one second separated Janka from 13th place Felix Neureuther. Starting in reverse order in the second run, Neureuther briefly led, but the best time of the second run came from Kjetil Jansrud in 1:20.15, starting in 11th position. Jansrud then had an anxious wait as the leaders came down. When Svindal came to take his second run, his combined time of 2:38.44 was not good enough to overtake his compatriot. Baumann then made mistakes, and finished only fifth. With a lead of 0.80 seconds over Jansrud, Janka skied well enough to finish with a combined time of 2:37.83, defeating Jansrud by 0.39 seconds to take the gold medal.
From the first six finishers five used Atomic skis, while only fifth placed Baumann was on Salomon. Two notable skiers lower down the order – Dow Travers, finishing 69th, and Muhammad Abbas finishing 79th – were the first ever competitors in a Winter Olympics from the Cayman Islands and Pakistan, respectively.

The winner was a nineteen year old university student from Japan, Noboru Terada. Terada went out hard from the start and never came under pressure from the other finalists. He was a half a length ahead at the finish. Medica, after having been out of the medals early on in the race, edged ahead of Uto with just over 100m to go.

Alberto Contador of Spain did not compete and Nairo Quintana of Colombia, who finished third in the Tour de France shortly before the Olympics, opted out of Rio to concentrate on the Vuelta after the Games. Spain’s best chance of gold came from Alejandro Valverde, bronze medallist at the 2012, 2013 and 2014 World Championships and four Grand Tour podiums in the last three years.
There were no changes in the format since London 2012, with the 144 starters setting off in a mass start from Flamengo Park and, after travelling 37.4 km along Avenida Atlântica, adjacent to the Atlantic Ocean and Copacabana Beach, they then completed four laps of the 24.7 km Grumari circuit, which was used for the time trials, and had two challenging climbs: the Grota Funda and the Grumari climb. After leaving Grumari, the competitors engaged in a 26.4 km ride to the 25.7 km Vista Chinesa circuit, with its two climbs, Canoas and Vista Chinesa, and its 6 km descent, of which they completed two laps followed by a third loop of 20.2 km, and then the 3.3 km ride back to Flamengo Park. The total distance was 237.5 km.
The fans were treated to high drama and none more than in the closing stages. After just 15 km, however, came the first attack by six riders and they gradually increased their lead to over seven minutes. They stayed together at the front, falling apart around 160 km, but one of the leaders, Michał Kwiatkowski of Poland, the 2014 World Champion, actually stayed in the lead, either on his own, or part of a group, until the 197 km mark – a total of 185 km in the lead. He was dropped from the leading group at that point but got back into it and he was still one of the 11-man breakaway group at 207 km, which also included Sergio Luis Henao of Colombia and the British pair of Adam Yates, winner of the Young Rider classification in the 2016 Tour de France and Geraint Thomas, who sportingly stopped and waited while Chris Froome changed his bike at 142 km. Henao was a member of the Sky team that helped Froome win his third Tour de France in 2016.
With just 16.5 km to go, Sergio Luis Henao, 2016 Giro winner Nibali and Rafał Majka of Poland were the three front runners and seemed to have the medal positions wrapped up between them, but just four kilometres later, Henao and Nibali crashed heavily on the Vista Chinesa descent, which is where Geraint Thomas and Australia’s Richie Porte’s races also ended. This accident allowed the 2016 Tour de France King of the Mountains winner Majka to build up a 20-second lead that he soon extended to 24 seconds. With seven men in the chasing pack, however, he was caught with 1400 metres to go as Belgium’s Greg Van Avermaet crossed the line first in 6hr 10min 5sec and enjoyed the biggest win of his career, bettering his 2015 and 2016 stage wins in the Tour de France. Van Avermaet’s father Ronald also competed in the road race, at the 1980 Moscow Olympics. This was only Belgium’s second ever gold in the men’s road race, following André Noyelle’s win in 1952. Majka held on for the bronze with Jakob Fuglsang winning the silver medal with the same time as Van Avermaet.

Women were allowed to compete in dressage in 1952 and four took that opportunity – Lis Hartel (DEN), Ida von Nagel (GER), Else Christophersen (NOR), and Marjorie Haines (USA).
Hartel, however, was the big story of the event. In September 1944, while pregnant, she developed poliomyelitis. Unable to walk for awhile, Hartel eventually developed the ability to walk with braces, although she remained partially paralyzed below her knees. At Helsinki, she still had to be helped on and off her horse but she came through to win the silver medal, trailing Sweden’s Henri Saint Cyr, who won quite easily. At the victory ceremony, Saint Cyr helped Hartel ascend the podium.
Saint Cyr returned in 1956 and repeated as the gold medalist, and Hartel also repeated as the silver medalist.

These three lived up to their expectations and were joined in the semi-final by Ortíz of Mexico.
Sergo was a factory worker but had received generous backing by the Federazione Pugilistica Italiana and was in excellent physical condition. Sergo defeated Cederberg and moved on to the final where he would meet Wilson for the gold medal. Although Wilson, at 5 ft 10 in/182 cm,  was the taller man and had a reach advantage over his opponent, the tenacious Italian took the fight to the American. The first round was close but Sergo moved up a gear from then on, forcing his opponent back onto the ropes and negating his physical advantages. Wilson had been considered the USA’s best chance of a championship but when he tried to turn the fight his way in the final round he had left it too late, Sergo was a clear champion.
Sergo went on to win the European Amateur championships on home soil in 1937 and retain it in 1939 in Dublin. He would have been a strong medal contender for the cancelled 1940 Games. With no prospect of further Olympic success available, Sergo turned professional but no less than six attempts at Italian national titles ended in failure. Jackie Wilson’s professional début came in late 1936 in Los Angeles, where he was to base his career. One of the best lightweights and welterweights of his era, he was unlucky never to earn a world title shot. He did however win a California state title and went the distance with both Sugar Ray Robinson and Jake LaMotta.

Berger had a brief pro career but then served as a sparring partner and manager to future World Heavyweight Champion Jim Jeffries. The 1904 AAU Champion was William Rodenbach, who had also won that title in 1901, but was primarily a middleweight, having won that AAU title from 1900-04. He did not enter either class at the Olympics after suffering an arm injury. New York’s Joe Knipe, national amateur champion in 1899 and 1900, was heralded in the local press as a strong favourite for the championship until his entry was rejected due to his activities as trainer to professional boxers.

They built up a continuously growing lead, and like the Russians lost only one bout. Veteran and two times individual Olympic Champion Mariel Zagunis secured the medal-winning hit.

She was looking for a Spitz-like performance in Seoul, aiming for six gold medals, and her first race was the 100 freestyle. Swimming World noted that this race was the first time in 12 years that all the world’s top swimmers had gathered at the Olympics. Otto was expected to be challenged by Americans Dara Torres, winner of the 1987 Pan Pacs and 1988 world leader with 55.30, and Mitzi Kremer, ranked third in the world in 1988. But they were non-factors, as Kremer did not make the final, and Torres would finish only seventh.
In the final, Otto was challenged by China’s surprising Zhuang Yong, who had been ranked only 12th in the world in 1987 and was only ninth in 1988 coming into the Olympics. Otto won easily, Zhuang setting a PR of 55.50 for the silver, the first Olympic medal won by a Chinese swimmer. France’s Catherine Plewinski was another surprise, winning the bronze medal, although she even admitted she did not think she could qualify for the A final.

Bouts were for one touch with double touches counting as double losses. There is no record of barrage bouts being fenced, so they might have used the same system that was used in 1912. If there was a tie in the number of victories and the number of fencers who were tied was greater than the number who could qualify, the tie was resolved by using the results of the tied fencers in their bouts with each other as if another pool had been fenced. For example, if Fencer A and Fencer B were tied with 4 victories for fifth place in the pool but only five qualified and Fencer A had beaten Fencer B in the pool, then he would be the one promoted.
The organizers set up a fencing area by the stadium but it had no covering. Because it was raining, the competition was held instead in Middelheim, about 45 minutes away from the stadium, where they had installed linoleum pistes indoors for the foil events.
This was the only fencing event at the 1920 Olympics at which Nedo Nadi did not win a gold medal.  The event was won by France’s Armand Massard.  Massard returned again in 1924 at Paris, finishing fifth in individual épée.  The 1919 Inter-Allied épée had been won by France’s E. H. Laurent, who did not compete at Antwerp.

(86° F.). There was again no definite favorite, and the field of 101 runners set a slow pace, as the runners were concerned about the heat. At the 20 km. mark, Brazil’s Vanderlei de Lima opened up a small lead. By 30 km. he had pulled ahead by almost 50 seconds, but gradually the pursuers started to reel him in a bit, chopping 20 seconds off that lead over the next five kilometers. Unfortunately, at the 36 km. mark, a fan ran onto the course and ran directly at de Lima, pushing him briefly off the course. De Lima saw his stride broken, and he was unable to continue at the same pace. At 39 km. he was caught by Italy’s Stefano Baldini, who went into the lead and held on to win gold medal. The United States’ Meb Keflezighi, and Eritrean immigrant, also passed de Lima, and he took the silver medal, with de Lima holding on to win a bronze.
It turned out that the fan who had assaulted de Lima was a deranged former Irish priest, who had a history of these acts. He had once walked out onto the track at a Formula One race, fortunately not being harmed and not causing an accident, or injury to any drivers. De Lima protested the result, appealing that he should have been declared the winner, and that he would have won the race if not for the disturbance. That is unlikely, as Baldini and Keflezighi were closing on him at the time of incident, and he finished almost 1½ minutes behind Baldini, and 42 seconds behind Keflezighi, only holding off the fourth-place finisher, Britain’s Jon Brown, by 15 seconds. De Lima’s protest was disallowed. For Brown, it was an unfortunate second consecutive fourth place finish in the Olympic marathon.

Together they had won the 1975 World Championships and been runner-up in 1974, while Frank had also been part of the duo that won silver at the previous Olympics. The East German crew, meanwhile, consisted of Jürgen Bertow and Uli Schmied, the latter of whom had taken bronze at the last Olympics, gold at the 1974 World Championships, and had won the final edition of the European Championships in 1973. Great Britain could not be counted out either: their pairing of Chris Baillieu and Mike Hart had won two of the last four Double Sculls Challenge Cups at the Henley Royal Regatta and bronze medals at the last European Championship and the last two World Championships. The defending Olympic champions, the Soviets, had a less prestigious record over the past four years, having taken silver at the final European Championships and won the 1974 Double Challenge Sculls, but they had also not lost an Olympic final in this event since 1960. They sent Yevgeny Barbakov and Gennady Korshikov, the latter of whom was one of the defending gold medalists.
The Hansen brothers obliterated the competition in the opening round, setting a record and allowing only the Soviets and East Germans to come within ten seconds of the time. The semi-finals were much of the same: only Great Britain and West Germany got within ten seconds of the Norwegians, who set an Olympic record. The final was somewhat more competitive, with the Baillieu and Hart making a valiant effort to keep pace with the Hansen brothers, but the Norwegians never relented and rowed to a comfortable, and well-deserved, gold medal. Great Britain settled for silver and East Germany took bronze, keeping the Soviets off the podium for the first time since their inaugural appearance in 1952.

Since it had first been contested in 1900, the United States had never lost (Great Britain won in 1908 and 1912 when the Americans did not submit a crew) and they were therefore the overwhelming favorites in London, where they were represented by the Golden Bears of UC Berkeley. The only other nation that was considered as having even a remote chance at gold was Great Britain, who was represented by the Thames Rowing Club and whose lineup included Jack Dearlove, who had been among the latest victors in the Grand Challenge Cup at the Henley Royal Regatta. Italy sent its reigning European Championship team, who would defend their crown for the next two years (with a slightly different lineup in 1950).
The Americans dominated the entire competition, while Great Britain, Italy, and Canada were the other heat winners in the opening round. The width at Henley prevented more than three boats from competing at once and thus Italy, who had the misfortune of being placed against the United States in the semi-finals, were eliminated prior to the medal round, while Great Britain and Norway defeated Canada and Portugal respectively to ensure a spot on the podium. The final was no contest: the Americans won by over 10 seconds, continuing their undefeated streak, while the Britons settled for silver by finishing 3.4 seconds ahead of Norway.

Though he had not yet wrestled internationally as a light-heavy, he was considered a slight favorite, virtually by default. The event was very close with four wrestlers having 5 bad points after five rounds – K’art’ozia, Turk Tevfik Kış, Bulgarian Krali Bimbalov, and Hungarian Péter Piti. They met in round six with Bimbalov defeating Piti and Kış defeating K’art’ozia, both by decisions, which eliminated Piti and K’art’ozia. Kış and Bimbalov had met in round two, but that result was a draw, so the gold medal was decided based on bodyweight, with Kış winning the gold medal because he was lighter than Bimbalov. K’art’ozia won the bronze medal because he had defeated Piti in round six.

The title hopes of the depleted Australia and New Zealand teams were each ended by one round that they could not discard.

Keirin is one of the most exciting events in cycling because of the speeds.

The derny paces the riders for about 1,500 metres and then pulls off the track, at which time the cyclists begin a furious sprint to the finish.  Keirin racing has traditionally been raced in Japan, where it has been a professional sport for over 20 years, and in which pari-mutuel betting on the riders is permitted.

The ongoing Super G World Cup saw different winners in all six races with Weirather winning in Lake Louise, Flury in St. Moritz, Vonn (Super G World Cup winner in 2014/15) and Veith in the Val d’Isère double, Brignone in Bad Kleinkirchheim and Gut in Cortina d’Ampezzo. Gut, winner of the Super G Crystal Globe in 2013/14 and 2015/16 and the bronze medalist in this event at the 2017 World Championships, topped the current standings. She was followed by Weirather, the 2016/17 Super G World Cup winner and silver medalist from the 2017 Worlds, and Schnarf in third. The reigning World Champion was Nicole Schmidhofer, who had struggled with injuries in the last two seasons, and the gold medalist from Sochi as well as from the 2015 World Championships, Anna Veith, was back for this season. Maria Höfl-Riesch and Nicole Hosp, the other two medalists from Sochi, had both since retired.
The starting order for speed events was changed since the last Olympics. The top 10 racers of the World Cup Starting List (WCSL), beginning with the leader, could choose an odd bib number from 1-19, while the next ten racers from the WCSL could choose an even bib number from 2-20. Because of the multiple delays with windy conditions, there were no downhill training runs before this race.
The weather was sunny, but still cold at -9° C. at the start and the gusty winds were still a factor. After seven racers Weirather was in the lead, just 0.01 seconds ahead of Gut, who was also only another 0.03 seconds ahead of Schnarf. The changing winds meant that not all skiers had the same conditions, but with bib #15 Veith took the lead, 1/10th of a second faster than Weirather. It looked like a fairytale that Veith could win gold after missing almost two seasons due to a multiple ligament right knee injury in October 2015 and another surgery in her left knee due to a chronic inflammation in February 2017.
Ester Ledecká in bib #26, however, ended this dream and a new fairytale started. Ledecká, whose best World Cup Super G result ever at this point was twice 19th, was only 0.01 seconds faster than Veith to win the most surprising Alpine skiing gold at this Games. Her winning speed was 89.21 km/h and at the end Ledecká was only 25 cm. ahead of Veith.
Ledecká, who was already a double snowboarding World Champion, went on to also win gold in the snowboarding parallel giant slalom seven days later to win a unique and unusual double at the Olympics, becoming the first ever woman (summer and winter) to win two gold medals in two different sports at the same Olympics. She was also the first ever Alpine skiing Olympic champion from the Czech Republic, breaking the Austrian domination in this event, who had won the last three titles.
The bronze medal won by Weirather was the first ever Super G medal for Liechtenstein and the first Olympic medal (summer and winter) for this country since Paul Frommelt won bronze in slalom back in 1988. For her win Ledecká used Atomic skis loaned to her by Mikaela Shiffrin, who did not participate in this race, while Veith and Weirather skied Head. Ledecká also created the most comical press moment at these Games, when she appeared at the press conference wearing her ski goggles. She later explained that she never expected to win a medal and so she was not made up.

Major league baseball did not release its players, however, so the USA team was made up of minor leaguers, several of whom were former Major Leaguers.

The race started and at 8 AM at the North Curve of the Avus motor racing circuit, with the finish line drawn there as well.  The course was an out-and-back one over relatively flat roads, and it was not difficult enough to break apart most of the peleton. There were a number of crashes during the race. Many riders used the innovative three-speed bikes, but several of the Peruvian riders had trouble controlling their bikes with these and caused at least one major crash. Some 40 riders sprinted for victory in the final metres, with France’s Robert Charpentier defeating his countryman Guy Lapébie by a bike length. They led the French team to an easy victory in the team road race. Behind them, the German officials had trouble placing the remaining cyclists, and a large group of cyclists was placed in 16th position. There was another large crash only a few yards from the finish line, which took down about 20 riders, several of whom could not finish.
Charpentier had been runner-up at the 1935 World Championships.  He turned professional but with little success, and his career was interrupted by World War II.

This result may have been the major surprise in the early rounds of the women’s individual foil tournament but was not the only upset for some other top ten athletes. The two best US fencers, Lee Kiefer and Nzingha Prescod, also went out in the same round and Korea’s Nam Hyeon-Hui lost her first bout (round of 32) against Shiho Nishioka, whose previous best result was finishing 21st at the 2013 World Championships. France lost its two competitors, Ysaora Thibus and Astrid Guyart, each to  Russian opponents in the quarter-finals. That left two Russians in the semi-finals, along with Italy’s 2012 gold medalist Elisa Di Francisca and Tunisia’s Ines Boubakri who, despite winning a bronze medal at the 2014 World Championships, was the least expected member of the last four. But Boubakri had already eliminated the surprise winners Harvey and Nishioka on her way to the semi-final.
In the semi-finals, Inna Deriglazova outclassed compatriot Aida Shanayeva 15–3 in an all-Russian bout. Di Francisca had more trouble outscoring Boubakri 12–9. In the final, Di Francisca took an early three-point before Deriglazova enjoyed an impressive 7–0 rally in the second period. With only half a minute to go, the Russian led 12–7 but Di Francisca desperately came back with four consecutive points, but the  Russian held on for a narrow 12–11 victory. Deriglazova, eight years younger than Di Francisca destroyed the Italian’s dream of repeating her 2012 triumph. Ines Boubakri, however, took home the first Olympic medal won by an African female fencer by beating Shanayeva 15-11 in the bronze medal bout.

Britain’s Greg Rutherford was the defending champion and was in the final but there was no obvious favorite. In round one he took the early lead with 8.18 but was surpassed by American Jeff Henderson, the 2015 Pan Am Games Champion, with 8.20. He held the lead through round two until Rutherford popped 8.22 in round three. This did not hold up as American Jarrion Lawson jumped 8.25 near the end of the round, although the jump could have been longer as his left hand hit the sand behind his body and the mark had to be measured to where his hand hit the sand.
In round four South African Luvo Manyonga recorded 8.28, a low-altitude personal best, to take the lead. In round five, he upped that to 8.37 to take a comfortable lead. With only three jumpers remaining Henderson cleared 8.38 in the final round, taking the lead by one centimetre. Rutherford had his best mark in the final round, with 8.29, but could not move up and won the bronze medal, as Henderson won gold, and Manyonga silver. Lawson struggled in the final three rounds with two fouls, and finished fourth.

In 2021, however, they lost their title to the Russian pairing of Anastasiya Mishina and Aleksandr Gallyamov, who were making their World Championships début, with two other Russian pairs, skating under the banner of the Russian Skating Federation, also closing the gap on them compared to previous years. At the European Championships in January, Russian pairs swept the podium and both the pairings of Mishina and Gallyamov and Yevgeniya Tarasova and  Vladimir Morozov broke the existing world’s best total score.
The scene was set for a showdown between the Chinese pair and the Russian Olympic Committee pairs. The first part of the competition saw Han and Sui go into the lead after breaking the world best score for the short program, but the margin over Tarazova and Morozov was only 0.16 points and the other two Russian pairs were still in strong contention.
The free skating phase turned out to be one of the most exciting sessions of the entire Beijing programme. Mishina and Galliamov, who were third after the short program, made the podium with a high-class performance but Tarasova and Morozov performed nearly flawlessly to lead with only the Chinese pair to perform. Four years earlier, Sui and Han led at the half-way stage only to make a couple of minor mistakes, which cost them the gold medal by less than a point. In front of a home audience and skating to Simon and Garfunkel’s “Bridge Over Troubled Water” they opened with a perfectly executed quadruple twist, which set the tone for the rest of their routine. Their triple salchow, however, was downgraded for its execution and it remained uncertain if they had done enough for win. When the scores were tabulated, they had done just enough and held off the ROC pair by .63. This after losing gold in PyeongChang by just .53 of a point Unsurprisingly, this proved one of the most popular victories of the entire Games as far as the home nation was concerned.
Away from the medals there were some hard luck stories. The Hungarian pair withdrew when one of them was forced out after contracting COVID-19, while Nolan Seegert of Germany also fell victim to the virus and, although he recovered, he was so weakened by the illness that he was unable to lift his partner and they dropped to last place.
As the Games ended the American husband and wife pair of Brandon Frazier and Alexa Scimeca Knierim were informed of a lawsuit by the band “The Heavy Young Heathens”, which also encompassed US Figure Skating and the NBC television network, over use of their version of the song without the artists’ permission. A few days later Laura Barquero of the 11th placed Spanish pair was announced as having failed a doping test for Clostebol. After investigation she and her partner, Marco Zandrón were disqualified in October 2022.

There were even stories of pubs in rural Ireland who were illegally extending their opening hours so customers could watch her Olympic races and celebrate her victories.
The third and last of Smith’s victories was the hardest of the three. She led at 100 metres but slumped back to fourth over his breaststroke leg before counterattacking over the last fifty to edge home in front of Canadian Marianne Limpert. When Smith was convicted of tampering with a urine sample in 1998 and subsequently banned from the sport, the Canadian authorities asked the IOC to consider stripping Smith of her Olympic medals but nothing came of this.

The tough Dutchman had already beaten the representatives of Spain and Great Britain before he faced Harry Devine of the United States in the semi-final round. Van Klaveren started and finished the fight strongly and his harder punching and higher work rate saw him safely through. Víctor Peralta of the Argentine lay in wait for the Dutchman in the final and although reports vary on who deserved the victory, the decision in favour of Van Klaveren led to outrage in the Argentine support. Dutch police were called to calm the disturbances which went on for some time.
Van Klaveren’s professional career saw him fight on four continents and in many counties over an amazing 27-year span. Winner of national and European lightweight titles in the early thirties, he campaigned for many years in the United States and was in America when World War II broke out. After five years service in the Dutch army he resumed his career and won the national middleweight title. Retirement at the age of 41 proved temporary, he resumed fighting at the age of 47 and went on a remarkable run of victories that culminated in an attempt at the European welterweight title.
As the only Dutch boxer to have won Olympic gold he remains a legendary figure in his native country. A statue of him, in fighting pose, was erected in his hometown of Rotterdam after his death in 1992. A sign of his enduring popularity is that in 2007, he was voted the “Greatest Rotterdammer” of all time, beating, amongst others, the philosopher and theologian Erasmus.

Sándor Gombos had won the World Championships in 1926 and 1927 and was a slight favorite. He made it to the final and fenced well, with eight wins against three losses, but it would only bring him fifth place. The other two Hungarians, Ödön von Tersztyánszky and Attila Petschauer, both won nine bouts and faced each other in a barrage for the gold medal, with von Tersztyánsky winning 5-2. This would be the best sporting moments of what would be too-short lives for both.
Von Tersztyánsky died less than a year later in an automobile accident just outside of Budapest. His death was nothing compared to Petschauer’s. Petschauer was Jewish and during World War II was taken to Davidovka concentration camp in Ukraine, where he was tortured by the guards. In the freezing mid-winter, he was stripped nude and forced to climb a tree and crow like a rooster while they sprayed him with water. He died shortly thereafter. Petschauer’s death by torture was dramatized in the 1999 movie Sunshine starring Ralph Fiennes.

The 10-race opening series decided the gold and silver medals as the Australians opened a 28-point lead on New Zealand’s Peter Burling and Blair Tuke, who were in turn 32 points ahead of the rest of the field. The only suspense was for the bronze medal, which seemed to be set for Denmark, who were third after the opening series. The medal race was held on the Nothe course in light and shifty nine-knot winds, and Austria’s Nico Delle Karth and Niko Resch, who were only seventh entering the final race, dominated through the early sections and appeared set to move up to the bronze medal. But Danes Allan Nørregaard and Peter Lang, only seventh after four legs, steered hard left on the final upwind leg to pass Australia and moved back into the bronze medal position.

When the competition got underway the crowd saw the first ever Chinese boxer take part in Olympic competition although his début was a brief one. Chin Kuaiti was knocked out in the opening round of his first bout but his opponent, Shrimpton of Britain, was then disqualified for not obeying the referee’s instructions prior to the knockout blow. Unfortunately for the Chinese boxer the decision was reversed the next day.
Two other boxers who failed to record a victory were the reigning European champion, Lajos Szigeti of Hungary and the welterweight bronze medallist from Los Angeles, Finland’s Bruno Ahlberg, both were defeated in the second series having drawn byes in the first round of competition. The Norwegian fighter Henry Tiller moved through the rounds and his countrymen began seeing him as a prospective champion when he defeated the champions of South Africa, England and Germany in succession and then knocked down Chmielewski of Poland “at least half a dozen” times to gain a place in the gold medal match. The Norwegians were to be disappointed by a stylish French boxer by the name of Jean Despeaux. Despeaux varied his punches and style of fighting during the final and avoided the harder punches of Tiller. The Frenchman’s speed of hand became the deciding factor as the final was fought at a distance.
When the two men met again later in the year, Tiller beat Despeaux in contests in both Trondheim and Oslo. Despeaux turned professional and continued to box during the German occupation. He held the national middleweight twice between 1941 and 1945. After the war he had a brief career acting in French movies. Tiller stayed as an amateur and dominated Norwegian boxing, he even claimed the British ABA championship in 1938 - a rarity for a fighter from outside Britain and Ireland and unique for a Norwegian. He would have been one for the favourites if the 1940 Games had gone ahead. With the lure of an Olympic title gone, he opted for a professional career which ended prematurely after the German invasion of Norway.

This made van Almsick a clear favourite to win the event though some doubts, specifically about her sometimes erratic performances in heat swims, still remained. The German swimmer actually produced one of her best qualifying swims in Atlanta and was the fastest of the eight qualifiers.
The second fastest qualifier was Claudia Poll of Costa Rica, who was the current short course world champion at the distance. To everyone’s surprise Poll took the lead from the German at 75 metres and was never headed as she sped away to take her country’s first ever Olympic gold.

Since 2005 his only defeats at the World Championships had come from Khasan Baroyev of Russia, the 2004 Olympic Champion and the 2008 runner-up, and Rıza Kayaalp of Turkey, who was now the reigning World Champion. They were both in London, but were only two among a host of other strong entrants who were seen as unlikely to challenge López for the crown.
López powered through the tournament, which included defeating Kayaalp in the semi-finals. Baroyev, meanwhile, was conquered in his first match and, when the dust of the tournament had settled, Heiki Nabi of Estonia stood to challenge López for gold. Nabi had been a heavyweight wrestler throughout his career, winning the 2006 World Championship in the division, but had switched to the super-heavyweight category to compete in his first Olympics. In the end, however, it was López’s experience and raw power that won the day, making the most of his top advantage in the first-round par terre and successfully defending against both a gut-wrench and a challenge to his Olympic title in the second.
In the first bronze medal match, Kayaalp easily defeated Guram Pherselidze of Georgia, pushing him out of the ring in two rounds and claiming a podium spot. In the contest for the other bronze medal, Belarus’ Iosif Chugoshvili and Sweden’s Johan Eurén, a bronze medalist from the 2010 European Championships, were evenly matched. The first two rounds went to par terre, where each wrestler was successful in their defense, which left the final podium spot up to a final, decisive two minutes. With neither competitor able to score in the first 90 seconds, and with points and cautions tied, a ball was drawn to determine who would choose the positions in the final par terre. Chugoshvili won and picked the top position, but was unable to convert this advantage into any points, giving Eurén the bronze.

The heavy favorite was Shaun White of the United States, the defending champion, who had taken the sport to new dimensions with his famed Double McTwist (three horizontal inside two vertical flips) and the double cork spin (two off-axis rotations, or diagonal flips) since his victory in 2006. Since Torino, he had won the superpipe at the Winter X Games in both 2008 and 2009. There were questions about the sport in 2010, as a pre-Games contender, American Kevin Pearce, had hit his head hard on the top of pipe while attempting a double cork spin, and had sustained a severe traumatic brain injury. Only a few weeks earlier, at the Winter X Games, White had won the superpipe, but had hit his chin on the top of pipe on one run, fortunately not severely injuring himself.
White qualified comfortably for the final in Vancouver. In his first run in the final he scored 46.8 (out of 50) to lead comfortably over Scotty Lago (USA) with 42.8 and Swiss rider Iouri Podladtchikov, who had competed at Torino for Russia, and had recently been second to White at the Winter X Games with 42.4 points. Many of the competitors had ambitious programs for their second run, but most failed to complete their runs without serious error. One exception was Peetu Piiroinen (FIN), runner-up at the 2009 US Open, who exceeded his 40.8 first run score with a run worth 45.0 points that moved him into second place. By the time White was to start his second run, he was already assured of the gold medal, and thrilled the crowd by putting in his trademark Double McTwist movement for an outstanding score of 48.4 points.

But while skiing prior to the round, Swiss skiier Nicolas Bochatay was killed in a tragic accident. Warming up with his teammate, Pierre-Yves Jorand, the two jumped over a mogul, but Bochatay was surprised to see a parked Sno-Cat on the course, and he crashed into it, dying quickly from the internal injuries he sustained. Jorand was un-injured, but he and another Swiss skiier, Roger Stump, withdrew from the competition. The fourth Swiss skiier, Silvano Meli, and the Swiss women’s team did continue to compete.
The semi-final round was still held and was then led by Philippe Goitschel, nephew of the famous Goitschel sisters, Christine and Marielle, who had starred in the Alpine ski events at the 1964 Innsbruck Olympics.

It is played indoors on a dédan, with a very complicated system of scoring.  Finesse and strategy count for far more than power as in what was then called lawn tennis.
Professional tennis has crowned a world champion since the mid-18th-century in a series of challenge matches, not unlike professional boxing or chess.  The greatest professional players of the era were British, Peter Latham and Cecil “Punch” Fairs.  Latham had claimed the title in 1895, and defended it in 1898 and 1904, but lost it in 1905 to Fairs, who again defeated him in 1906.  Latham regained the championship in 1907 and 1908, with Fairs claiming the championship again later in 1908 and winning his final championship in 1910.  Because of the amateur restrictions, neither could compete in the Olympics.
Among the amateurs the top British player in 1908 was Eustace Miles who was Amateur Tennis Champion in 1899-1903, 1905-1906, and 1909-1910.  He had also been American champion in 1900.  But the top player of the era was an American, the youthful Jay Gould, the son of the well-known robber baron of the Gilded Age of the late 19th century.  Gould won the American championship in 1906-1917 and 1920-1925.  He was also British champion in 1907 and 1908 and would later become world professional champion in 1914 and 1916.
The entries were all from Great Britain and the United States.  The Official Report and The Times expressed regret that the top French “paumiers” did not enter, notably M. A. de Luze and M. Basin.  Both Miles and Gould entered the Olympic tournament, setting up a match between the top amateur players of the era.  The only other non-British entrant was Charles Sands, who had been U.S. champion in 1905, and won the gold medal in men’s golf at the 1900 Olympics in Paris.
Gould and Miles were the class of the tournament.  Miles got to the final by winning three matches by 3-0, and Gould, who had received an opening round bye, won two matches by 3-0.  In the final, Gould also won all three sets, but it was a well-fought match, the set scores being close at 6-5, 6-4, and 6-4.  Miles actually led every set, but could not close out Gould.  Miles had a 4-1 and 5-2 advantage in the first set, but lost the last four games of that set.  He likewise lost the last three games of the second set after leading 4-3, and with the 3rd set even at 4-4, Gould closed out the match by winning the last two games.
The precise scoring of the final was as follows, Gould always listed first:  Set 1 - 4-2 (1-0), 4-6 (1-1), 3-5 (1-2), 5-7 (1-3), 1-4 (1-4), 4-1 (2-4), 2-4 (2-5), 4-2 (3-5), 4-2 (4-5), 5-2 (5-5), 4-1 (6-5); Set 2 - 4-0 (1-0), 3-5 (1-1), 4-0 (2-1), 2-4 (2-2), 2-4 (2-3), 4-1 (3-3), 0-4 (3-4), 4-2 (4-4), 5-3 (5-4), 4-2 (6-4); and Set 3 - 2-4 (0-1), 2-4 (0-2), 6-4 (1-2), 2-4 (1-3), 5-3 (2-3), 4-1 (3-3), 4-1 (4-3), 2-4 (4-4), 4-2 (6-4), 5-3 (6-4).

Instead, their nations were represented by Rolf Peterson and Aurel Vernescu respectively, the latter of whom was the current European and World runner-up.

Vernescu bested Suhrbier in the second heat, while Pisarev finished third behind Poland’s Władysław Szuszkiewicz and Great Britain’s Alistair Wilson in a heat where everyone advanced. Szuszkiewicz, in a heat that included Hesz and was won by Günther Pfaff of Austria, was the only one of these men not to advance after the semi-finals. Vernescu and Hansen won the other heats, the latter once again with the round’s fastest time. Considering his performance thus far, Hansen seemed as if he was a shoo-in for gold, but he struggled heavily in the final and finished seventh. In its closing seconds, the race for the Olympic title came down to a drive between Peterson and Hesz, the former of whom edged out the latter by only 0.15 seconds.

The United States had a fighter in the heavyweight final, George Foreman, but he was very inexperienced, having had only 18 amateur fights prior to Mexico City. He won his first Olympic fight by 4-1 decision and then pummeled his next two opponents to advance to the final against Lithuanian Soviet Jonas Čepulis. The final was more of the same as the referee stopped the bout early in the second round, giving Foreman the gold medal. He made many fans in the United States when he paraded around the ring after his victory carrying a small American flag, in contrast to the protests that several American blacks had made in Mexico City, notably Tommie Smith and John Carlos on the podium after the 200 metre dash, which were not well received at the time.
A huge puncher, Foreman turned professional after Mexico City and quickly became one of the world’s top heavyweights. In January 1973, he knocked out the world champion and 1964 Olympic gold medalist Joe Frazier, to win the world heavyweight title, knocking him down 6 times in 2 rounds, as ring announcer Howard Cosell announced repeatedly, “Down goes Frazier“. Undefeated through 34 bouts, in 1974 he fought Muhammad Ali in a title bout in Kinshasa, Zaire, which Ali alliteratively titled “The Rumble in the Jungle“. A seeming mismatch as Ali, the 1960 light-heavyweight gold medalist, was now older and past his prime, but he brought back the brilliance to win by knockout in the eighth round. Foreman came back in 1976 to win the NABF heavyweight title against Ron Lyle, and defended it in 1977 with a TKO of Frazier. After losing in 1977 to Jimmy Young, Foreman retired, or so it seemed, and became a preacher.
However, 10 years later, the 38-year-old Foreman came out of retirement in 1987 and fought for another decade. He won 24 consecutive bouts in his comeback, before losing a title fight to Evander Holyfield, but in 1994 Foreman stunningly defeated Michael Moorer to win the WBA and IBF world heavyweight titles, at the age of 45 years. At his final retirement in 1997, we think, his career professional record was 76 wins, 68 by knockout, and 5 losses.

The last four ABA Champions were present - John Douglas (1905), Arthur Murdoch (1906), Rube Warnes (1907 and 1910), and William Childs (1908-09, and 1911).
The final came down to Douglas and Baker, and was described as the best match of the tournament. The first round was even. Douglas knocked Baker down in round two, but he continued in a closely fought battle. However, Douglas hung on in round three to win on points. Douglas was presented his gold medal by his father, who was then the President of the ABA. John Douglas, the son, was actually better known as a cricketer and later captained Essex County and England teams. He and his father died tragically in a sea disaster returning from Finland in December 1930.
Snowy Baker is the greatest all-around athlete ever produced by Australia. He competed at the 1908 Olympics in boxing, diving, and swimming. In addition to those three sports, he represented Australia at the international level in rugby union and water polo. He was also state or national caliber in cricket, track & field athletics, and rowing. In December 1908, he was appointed referee for the Jack Johnson vs. Tommy Burns heavyweight professional bout, which was held in Sydney, but Johnson objected to Baker’s snow-white hair (hence his nickname), and he was replaced. Baker later became a movie star and stuntman.

Choi had the led the qualifiers, taking a three-point lead into the final. On the final shot, Jin scored 10.2 to Choi’s 8.1 to win by ½-a-point. This made Korea the first nation since the Soviet Union in 1960 to go 1-2 in this event.
Jin’s victory was historic in a number of ways. Most importantly, this made Jin the first shooter to ever win three individual gold medals in Olympic shooting. He also became the first shooter to win two gold medals at one Olympics since Unified Team shooter Marina Dobrancheva-Logvinenko in 1992, and only the second shooter to do so since 1924, back when there were numerous team events. In fact, Jin became only the seventh shooter to win two individual gold medals at one Olympics, following Dobrancheva-Logvinenko and five shooters from 1906-20. This was also his third consecutive medal in the event, as he had also won a silver in 2004.
The world #1 seed Damir Mikec of Serbia placed only 16th in qualifying, after a disappointing 90 in his second series. Five shooters tied for eighth in qualifying and had to shoot-off for the finals, which was won by Italian Giuseppe Giordano with 49.6.

Many sources describe the competition as a single game between an American side and a Swedish one, but there was also a second game held that is not often mentioned. The original schedule called for two games, beginning on the evening of July 10, during the track & field athletics competition. The first game was to be between two US teams, East vs. West, with the winner then taking on Västerås Bäsboll Klubb.
The American Olympic Committee, however, forbade the US players from taking part in any exhibition until they had finished competing in their primary events. The game date then shifted to the morning of Monday, 15 July, with Västeras playing a combined US team. The US intersquad game was postponed to 16 July. It was held at the Östermalm Idrottsplats (Athletic Park).
The US-Sweden game started at 10 in the morning on Monday, 15 July. The Americans got to Platt Adams, pitching for Västerås, early, scoring four runs in the first. The Americans scored again in their half of the second to go up by 5-0. The Swedes got on the scoreboard with a pair of runs in the fourth. The Yanks put the game out of reach with an eight-run fifth inning. The Västerås club managed a final tally in the sixth, aided by the fact that they were allowed six outs in the frame. The US won by a 13-3 score. One of the big guns for the United States was Abel Kiviat, who played short and batted third in the order. Kiviat stole a base and had a pair of hits in four at bats, including a triple. All told, eight American Olympic medalists took part in the game.

The races were held on a 10 nautical mile (18.5 km) course.
The Dutch dominated this class in the 1950s but they boycotted the 1956 Olympics, protesting the Soviet invasion of Hungary, which left the medal chase wide-open. The Oceanian boats of Jest (New Zealand) and Falcon IV (Australia) were the class of the event, winning five of the seven races. The Australian pair of Rolly Tasker and John Scott led after six races and appeared to have won the final race and the gold, but the French protested and Australia was disqualified which gave first place to New Zealand and its crew of Peter Mander and Jack Cropp. The two boats tied on total points, with 6,086, but New Zealand had won three races to Australia’s two, giving them the gold medal.

They were likely to face strong competition from Philippa Baker and Brenda Lawson of New Zealand, the 1993 and 1994 World Champions and the 1995 bronze medalists.

The runners started at the Olympic stadium, ran north to the small town of Sollentuna, where they turned just beyond the main village church and returned to the Olympic stadium.  Unfortunately the day of the race dawned very hot for Stockholm, a common occurrence in Olympic marathon racing.  Gynn and Martin have noted “Unconfirmed reports have suggested a temperature of 32° C. (89.6° F.) in the shade.”
Most of the world’s top long-distance runners were present.  The Americans entered 12 runners, the maximum, including the Boston Marathon champions of 1911 (Clarence DeMar) and 1912 (Mike Ryan), two Indian runners (Lewis Tewanima, a Hopi; and Andrew Sockalexis, a Penobscot), and Joe Forshaw, who had run the Olympic marathon in 1906 and 1908, winning the bronze medal at London.  The British entered eight runners, including Harry Barrett, who won the 1909 Polytechnic race, and the 3rd-8th place finishers at the 1912 Polytechnic race.
The top two finishers from the 1912 Polytechnic Marathon were not British but both were present at Stockholm.  Canada’s James Corkery had won the race, followed by South Africa’s Chris  Gitsham.  South Africa also entered Kenneth McArthur, who was little known outside of his native country.  But between 1909 and 1911 he had won three marathon distance races in South Africa, and had never been defeated at marathon distances.
The race was led through the early stages by Tatu Kolehmainen, Hannes’s brother.  At the turn-around at Sollentuna, Chris Gitsham was the leader in 1-12:40, followed by Kolehmainen and McArthur, with a group of five (Fred Lord [GBR], Carlo Speroni [ITA], Alexis Ahlgren [SWE], Sigfrid Jacobsson [SWE], and Corkery) within a minute of the leader.
By 25 km. Kolehmainen had caught Gitsham and the two ran together for several miles.  But Kolehmainen dropped out by 35 km. and McArthur caught his teammate at that point (reached in 2-14:20) and they led by over one minute from Jacobsson and America’s virtual unknown, Gaston Strobino.
At the base of a hill, a few kilometres outside the stadium, Gitsham stopped to drink, and McArthur pulled away to take the lead for good.  He entered the stadium comfortably ahead, and the two South Africans finished one-two.  Strobino finished third.  Almost a phantom among American track & field medalists, he had qualified for the Olympic team when he had finished 2nd in a half-marathon in New York earlier in 1912.  After the Olympics, Strobino retired and never raced again.
The 1912 Olympic marathon also saw the Games’ first tragedy.  Portuguese marathoner Francisco Lázaro from the effects of the race and the hot weather.  Taken to Seraphim Hospital, he was never revived and he died on the morning after the race at 0620, the first fatality during an Olympic event.
Kennedy McArthur may be the least known Olympic marathon gold medalist.  South African historians know little of his life.  But Roger Gynn and Dave Martin, in their book on Olympic marathons, note that he is known to have run six marathons in his running career, and never lost.
In addition to the gold medal, Kennedy McArthur was awarded the Challenge Trophy for the marathon race, that had been donated in 1908 by the King of Greece.  The runners who finished in places 4-28 in the marathon were also awarded diplomas of merit.  This was all runners finishing within 20% of the winning time.

Stevenson had also won gold medals at the 1971 and 1975 Pan American Games and was the 1974 World Champion. He followed in the line of great Olympic heavyweight champions, after Joe Frazier (1964) and George Foreman (1968), but unlike those two, Cuban policies prevented him from turning professional. Stevenson had been defeated twice since the 1972 Olympics, both times by Soviet Igor Vysotsky, once in early 1976, but Vysotsky was not in Montréal because of eye injuries, which further opened the way for the Cuban.
The 1976 heavyweight tournament was simply a coronation for Stevenson, as none of his four matches lasted the distance. The Americans touted Johnny Tate, but in the semi-finals he went down to Stevenson’s hammer fists in only 1:29 of the first round. In the final Stevenson faced Romania’s Mircea Simion who ran away for two rounds rather than fight. Probably a wise decision as Stevenson finally caught him in round three and the referee quickly stopped the bout. Simion was not done running as he defected to the United States in 1977 and had a short pro career, lasting through 1979, finishing with a career record of 12 wins, 1 loss, and 1 draw.
Although Stevenson could not turn professional, fight promoters and agents drooled at the possibility, both because of his skills and his movie-star good looks. In 1980 he came back to win a third Olympic gold medal, becoming only the second boxer (at the time) to do that, following Hungary’s László Papp. He won further gold medals at the 1979 Pan American Games, and the 1978 and 1986 World Championships. Only the Soviet-led boycott of the 1984 Olympics likely kept Stevenson from a unique fourth consecutive Olympic boxing gold medal.

Ahonen and Thomas Morgenstern of Austria lay just a half point behind the Russian in joint second. While Lars Bystøl’s second leap was, at 103.5 m, an improvement on the first round jump, those in front of him could make a similar improvement and the Norwegian held on to win by a single point and claim Norway’s first ski jumping gold since 1994. More success came for Norway as Roar Ljøkelsøy, in his fourth Olympics, won his first Olympic medal placing third behind Matti Hautamäki of Finland.

In major internationals before Moscow, this was still evident as Hungary won the 1977 Worlds, with Yugoslavia and Italy taking the other medals, and at the 1978 European Championships, Italy won gold, Hungary silver, and Yugoslavia bronze.
The biggest upset of the Moscow preliminaries was that Italy placed third in Group B and did not make the final round, placing behind the Soviet Union and Spain, which was moving onto the world water polo stage to soon become a power. Group A saw Hungary win with the Netherlands second, while Group C advanced Yugoslavia and Cuba to the final pool.
The Soviet Union won its second water polo gold medal, after 1972, by winning all five of its games in the medal round, defeating Yugoslavia 8-7 in a match that determined the gold medal, the Yugoslavs taking silver. Hungary won the bronze, losing both of their matches to the Soviets and Yugoslavia by one goal. This marked the 12th consecutive Olympic Games at which Hungary had won a medal in water polo, with six golds, three silvers, and three bronzes. The streak would end at Los Angeles in 1984, but likely only because of the Soviet-led boycott. István Szivós competed for Hungary in Moscow, winning his fourth consecutive Olympic medal.
Spain placed fourth, with new young star Manuel Estiarte, who led all goal scorers with 22. Estiarte would eventually compete in six Olympics, and he would be the leading goal scorer in 1980, 1984, 1988, and 1992, setting the all-time Olympic record for a single tournament in 1984 with 34 goals. He is considered, along with Hungary’s Dezső Gyarmati, winner of five Olympic medals from 1948-64, one of the two greatest water poloists of all-time.

She and China’s He Kexin tied at 16.725 and had identical scores of 9.025 for execution and 7.700 for difficulty. He ended up with the gold medal by a complex tie-breaking system in which the highest and lowest scores for execution were eliminated until a winner was determined.
He’s entry in the 2008 Olympics was controversial. She was listed as 16-years-old, the minimum for the Olympics, but was very small, and looked about 10. An old entry for her listed her date of birth as 1994, but the Chinese stated that that was a clerical error. An investigation after the Olympics by the Fédération Internationale de Gymnastique (FIG) determined that she was eligible to compete in Beijing.

A full list would be hard to replicate, but we’ll mention 2012 World Champion and 1,000 m silver medallist Denny Morrison, 2011 World Champion Håvard Bøkko, defending Olympic champion Mark Tuitert, 2013 World Cup winner Zbigniew Bródka and 1,000 m winner Stefan Groothuis.
The race got serious in pair 13, when defending champion Tuitert put 1:45.42 on the clock, a major attempt to defend his title. It was beaten two pairs later, as Morrison bettered it to 1:45.22, leaving Bøkko behind him. Pair 17 saw Davis take the ice against Bródka. With all eyes on the American, it was the Pole who won that pair. Eager to beat his pairmate, he recorded a typical race that saw him lose 1 second of pace with every full lap, but his 1:45.00 was a new track record. The time remained unassailed until the last pair, which pitted Verweij and Mantia against each other. Mantia was quickly out of contention, but not Verweij. Having started a little slower than Bródka, he closed in on the Pole in his last lap, which would be the fastest closing lap, save for 4th place finisher Yuskov. At the finish line, the clock again stopped at 1:45.00 - a tie for first. Verweij and Bródka looked at the scoreboard in doubt to wait for the verdict on the thousandths of seconds. After nervewrecking moments for both, Verweij was recorded at 1:45.009, exactly 0.003 slower than Bródka. The latter celebrated his country’s first ever Olympic gold in the sport, earned by the smallest ever margin between gold and silver in Olympic speed skating.

For the first time in a big international competition five judges would give style points, and the highest and lowest style points were deleted. The old system included three judges, and all scores counted.
The Norwegian skiers had experienced a lot of disappointments during the 1948 Winter Olympics. Their Nordic Combined and Cross Country skiers had been able to win only one medal, bronze in the cross country relay. High expectations lay on the ski jumpers, but the Finnish, Swedish and US jumpers had impressed in the training sessions and the competition was expected to be tough.
The Norwegian team was originally selected to be Asbjørn Ruud, the youngest of the Ruud brothers, winner at Holmenkollen in 1946 and national champion in 1946 and 1948; Georg Thrane from Asker Skiklubb, winner at Holmenkollen in 1947, Petter Hugstedt, unmerited in international competitions but like the Ruud brothers also representing the famous ski jumping club Kongsberg IF. The fourth man on the team, Thorleif Schjelderup from Oslo, came second to Asbjørn Ruud at Holmenkollen in 1946. The double Olympic champion from 1932 and 1936, Birger Ruud, now aged 36, was also a member of the Norwegian team as a substitute and assistant coach. Late in the evening before the competition, the Norwegian team leaders decided to withdraw Thrane in favor of Birger Ruud, certainly after pressure from the organizers and FIS. Birger had impressed with excellent training jumps, he was extremely popular in Middle Europe, and his elder brother Sigmund was chairman of the FIS Jumping Committee. Thrane, who was informed of the decision at ten o’clock in the evening, was shocked by the message and his relations with the Ruud brothers were rather bad in the following years.
In the first round of the competition, the 20-year old Finn Matti Pietikäinen made an impressive jump of 69,5 metres and was in the lead, followed by Hugsted, Birger Ruud and Schjelderup. US jumper Gordy Wren jumped 68 metres, the second best in the first round, but lower style points placed him behind the three Norwegians. In the second round all the Norwegians jumped well. Hugstedt had the longest jump of the day, 70 metres, with 3x19.0 for his style points. Birger Ruud again showed his strong competitive instincts by taking the silver medal, and Schjelderup made the day perfect for the Norwegians by taking the bronze medal, only 0,5 points ahead of Pietikäinen. 
Hugstedt was never able to win at Holmenkollen or to win a national championship title. He won the international competition in Lahti, Finland 1947, and also the open US and Canadian Championships in 1949. After placing seventh in the Lake Placid World Championships 1950 he ended his jumping career. Matti Pietikäinen had his only Olympic appearance in 1948, but eight years later he was crowned World Champion in ski jumping in Falun, Sweden.

Sullivan, perhaps smarting from his defeat in the 100, was not a factor in the final and the race instead marked the breakthrough of American-trained Brazilian César Cielo Filho. The NCAA champion fought off the challenges of Bernard and his compatriot Amaury Leveaux to record a historic victory for Brazil.

Russian Tatyana Arkhipova bridged to the leaders at 32 km, and by 35 km, only four were left in the main pack to contest the medals – Keitany, Jeptoo, Gelana, and Arkhipova. Keitany attempted a surge on The Embankment, similar to the one that had won her the London Marathon, but nobody budged. The four went through 40 km together and Gelana then attacked, with only Jeptoo able to respond. Gelana quickly opened about 20 metres on Jeptoo but that margin stayed intact through the finish line, as Jeptoo could not close, and Gelana could not open further, winning the gold medal by five seconds. Behind them Keitany was spent and would drop to fourth, as Arkhipova won bronze.

The IOC decreed that the French sailing authorities should decide on the design of boat to be used and provided these boats for use at the Olympic Games. Unfortunately the number of entrants exceeded the number of boats available and a convoluted series of qualifying races had to be scheduled to eliminate just a single boat from the finals. The class was termed the Olympic Monotype, but was actually known as the Monotype national français (or French National Monotype), or Meulan, class, and was chosen as the monotype class by the Union des sociétés nautiques française (USNF). However, only 10 of the 16 boats were Monotype national français, with the other six slightly different and possibly of the very similar Belgian/Dutch Scheldejol class
Léon Huybrechts, a Belgian who had won silver medals in both 1908 and 1920, proved himself a master of the fickle French winds. He posted a comfortable victory in the first of the two races that made up the Olympic final then held off the challenge of the Dutch boat to win the second race and confirm himself as champion.

World champion Ivo Rüegg had succeeded compatriot Beat Hefti as World Cup winner and the two men had provided a Swiss presence on the podium at every preceding race of the 2009-10 season.
Multiple Olympic champion André Lange of Germany arrived to defend his two man title on the back of a brace of victories earlier in the year whilst his teammates Thomas Florschütz and Karl Angerer had both outperformed Lange in the early part of the season and were the beneficiaries of a change in qualifying rules which allowed three crews from some of the top nations to compete instead of the traditional Olympic quota of two.
With Canadian authorities limiting the number of runs available to foreign teams to the minimum required under Olympic regulations the home crews of Pierre Lueders and Lyndon Rush, with more experience on the track than any of the other teams, were also tipped to do well. In addition Rush had tied for victory with Andre Lange at the similarly high speed Sankt-Moritz track in January.
Veteran former medallist Todd Hays of the United states, returning after an absence from the sport, surprised many by placing second in the opening race of the season but his dreams of a fourth Olympic Winter Games came to an end in his very next race. A crash at the Winterberg track in Germany resulted in a cerebral haemorrhage and his immediate retirement from the sport.
The death of luger Nodar Kumaritashvili and the inevitable scrutiny about the safety of the track resulted in a few minor modifications of the course but there were still a number of accidents during the training runs. One of these crashes left Beat Hefti with a concussion and the Swiss slider was forced to withdraw from the event.
An explosive start to the event occurred when the Switzerland I bobsleigh of Ivo Rueggand Cédric Grand, off first, broke the track record with a time of 51.76, followed immediately by the Germany II bobsleigh of Thomas Florschütz  and Richard Adjei that also set a new track record of 51.57. However André Lange and Kevin Kuske, in the Germany I bobsleigh and aiming for a record 4th gold medal in the sport, finished just 0.02 seconds behind their compatriots after the first run. The Germany I and II bobsleighs then posted the fastest times of the 2nd, 3rd and 4th runs, in that order, to finish with the gold and silver medals. Taking the bronze medal were the Russia I team of Alexsandr Zubkov and Aleksey Voyevoda , who had been 5th after the first run, but then placed 3rd in each of the remaining three runs.
André Lange’s fourth successive Olympic gold again proved that his consistency of performance was unequalled. The final run of the event, his 16th in Olympic competition, was the ninth time he recorded the fastest time of the run. Only once in those sixteen performances had he placed outside the top three.
Four teams crashed out of the competition although thankfully there were no serious injuries. The fifth team to fail to finish were Italy I who were the victim of an error that saw them weigh in at below the minimum weight limit.

In the morning the leader of the classical ski was Spain’s Johann Mühlegg, who had changed citizenship from Germany to ski for the Spanish team in 1999. He led Norway’s Frode Estil by 13.2 seconds with Anders Aukland in third, another 7.2 back. In the afternoon, Mühlegg won the event easily, winning by almost 30 seconds, with Estil and his teammate Thomas Alsgaard dead-heating in what appeared to be a tie for second. Alsgaard had been only 15th after the classical section, but had the fastest time in the freestyle to catch Estil. Apparently in fourth place was Sweden’s Per Elofsson, the 2001 World Champion, and World Cup champion in 2000-01 and 2001-02.
But nine days later all the standings changed. Mühlegg failed a doping test after the 50 km race, and was stripped of his gold medal in that event. The Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) then ruled in 2003 that he could also be retroactively stripped of his gold medals in the pursuit and 30 km. Thus, Mühlegg was disqualified from this race, and Estil and Alsgaard declared co-champions, with Elofsson moving up to the bronze medal. But that did not happen quickly, as the medals were not re-distributed until 22 months after the race.

Abakumova struggled and did not make the final three throws, eventually placing 10th. Špotáková’s second and third rounds of 66.88 and 66.24 would also have brought her gold, but she got her best mark in round four with 69.55, easily winning the title, over four metres ahead of Germans Christina Obergföll (65.16), who had won bronze in 2008, and Linda Stahl (64.91). South African Sunette Viljoen, who led the world list coming into London, placed fourth. Špotáková became only the second woman to defend a javelin title, after East German Ruth Fuchs in 1972-76.

The U.S. was given the option of starting over or allowing the scores from 54 metres to stand.  The U.S. elected to start over, which was a mistake, in a sense, as the wind had picked up a bit and their scores in the re-shoot were lower.

Soltani’s opponent for the gold medal was the European Championship silver medallist Toncho Tonchev, a Roma (Gypsy) from Bulgaria.

At the halfway point the expected victory seemed a formality as the East Germans built up a sizeable lead. 
It was the third run that was to prove decisive and while Hoppe’s crew had a nightmare run and finished halfway down the field, Switzerland I flourished under the veteran driver Ekkehard Fasser and moved from a distant third into a clear lead by producing the fastest time of the competition. Though the GDR crew gained some time back over the final run it was not enough to deny Fasser an unlikely victory in the final event of his career.
Despite the excitement of the chase for the championship more publicity was garnered by a team that did not complete the competition. The novelty of seeing the Jamaican flag painted on the side of an Olympic bob had already caused excitement worldwide but the events of the third run helped the story to become a major news event. Coming too late out of the Kreissel curve the Jamaican bob overturned and slid down the track with the crew members’ helmets scraping the ice wall. Thankfully the team were unhurt in the accident and the sight of the quartet walking across the finish line alongside their bobsleigh was beamed to millions across the world.  The Jamaican story was later picked up by Hollywood and “Cool Runnings,” a film very loosely based around the 1988 Winter Olympics, was a massive success around the world.

(The only missing team was England, because Great Britain does not enter Olympic football tournaments.). Remarkably though, the last team to qualify was losing finalist Brazil, which had did not qualify directly from the continental qualifier. Other title contenders were Germany, the World Champion, and the United States, two-time Olympic Champion.
The favourites had a tough preliminary round, with Germany and Brazil opening against each other in a goal-less draw, while the US lost their first match to Norway. But the trio made it through to the semi-finals, supplemented by Japan, which upset the host nation in the quarter-finals. Led by star players Cristiane and Marta, the Brazilians took revenge for the lost World Cup final, beating Germany 4-1. Their opponent in the final was the same as in Athens. The United States overcame an earlier goal by Japan to win 4-2, and reached their fourth Olympic final in the fourth Olympic football tournament for women.
Like the previous women’s finals, the last match was a close affair. After the full 90 minutes, neither of the teams had scored. For the third time in succession, the Olympic final went into overtime. After six minutes, midfielder Carli Lloyd opened the score with a shot from just outside the box. Both teams then had good goal scoring changes in the remainder, but failed to convert them, and the United States won their third Olympic gold medal. With Germany winning the bronze medal match, the three podium nations were the same as they had been in 2004.
Though the US women had won Olympic gold medals in 1996 and 2004, World Cups in 1991 and 1999, and never failed to be on the podium at either event, the past year had been tumultuous for the American team. At the 2007 World Cup, the US faced Brazil in the semi-finals. The US goal keeper throughout the tournament had been Hope Solo, but US coach Greg Ryan benched her for the match against Brazil, replacing her with Brianna Scurry, formerly the top US keeper, but now in the twilight of her career. With Scurry in goal, Brazil crushed the Americans 4-0. Solo did not go quietly, telling the press quite firmly that her benching should not have happened, and that she would not have allowed those goals. After those remarks, Ryan threw Solo off the team for the bronze medal match and the US players refused to allow her to return to the team. Ryan was fired as national coach shortly after the World Cup. It was not until Sweden’s Pia Sundhage (a 1996 Olympian) was chosen to replace Ryan as coach that Solo was invited back to the national team.
Then shortly before the Beijing Olympics, further problems arose for the US in a friendly against Brazil. In that match, their final warm-up for the Olympics, American star striker Abby Wambach broke her tibia in a collision with Andreía Rosa. Wambach had surgery and could not play at the Olympics. With her scoring prowess missing, and the uncertainty of Solo in goal, the United States was considered somewhat of a mystery team in Beijing.

Canadian Tara Whitten had been fairly dominant in the discipline since its inception, winning the world title in 2010 and 2011, after having come in second in 2009 to Josephine Tomic. In 2012, however, Great Britain’s Laura Trott finally caught up to Whitten and earned the World Championship crown. Trott was a crowd favorite, having taken up cycling to recover from a sickly childhood: she was born with a collapsed lung, spent many months in intensive care, and was eventually diagnosed with asthma. For the past two years she had been a strong factor in Great Britain’s victories in the team pursuit, helping them win gold in the event at the 2010 and 2011 European Championships and the 2011 and 2012 World Championships. With these victories in hand, Trott set her sights on obtaining gold in London.
The British squad, along with Trott, emerged victorious in the Olympic team pursuit and, two days later, Trott was already on her way to capturing a second gold medal, winning the flying lap, the first of the six events that constitute the omnium. She faltered somewhat in the 20km points race, finishing tenth, but managed to chalk up another victory in the elimination race, leaving her in first place with 12 points following the opening day of competition. Behind her was Sarah Hammer of the United States, who had an equal number of points, having finished fifth in both the flying lap and the points race, but coming in second behind Trott in the elimination race. Hammer was a four time individual pursuit World Champion, a discipline she had taken up only when individual pursuit was removed from the Olympic program, leaving her in a good position to overtake Trott on the second day, where individual pursuit was the first event. She finished first in that competition, with Trott in second, and then took second place in the 10km scratch race, behind Annette Edmondson of Australia, who had been third in the rankings at the end of day one. With Trott having finished one position below Hammer in the scratch, Hammer enjoyed a two point advantage going into the final event, the 500m time trial. Even a personal best time of 35.900, however, was not enough for Hammer to dethrone Trott, who finished first, and three positions ahead her American rival, sufficient to claim Olympic gold. Hammer settled for silver while Edmondson, a relative newcomer, took home bronze. Trott’s gold medal, as well as her earlier victory in the women’s team pursuit, gave her the distinction of having won every European Championship, World Championship, and Olympic event that she has entered, for a total of eight at the conclusion of the London Games.

Several horses were clearly in distress due to the heavy rain that started after 30 of the 49 riders had gone out. This gave a huge advantage to the early starters. The course was very difficult and two horses died, probably exacerbated by the altitude problem that also affected the distance runners in Mexico City, as the two horse fatalities – Balerina from the Soviet Union and Loughlin from Ireland – occurred before the downpour.
The dressage leaders were Soviets Aleksandr Yevdokimov and German Gazyumov, followed by East German Ulrich Vite, but they had little bearing on the medal race, as Vite did not finish the event, Yevdokimov finished 21st, and Gazyumov was 10th. The endurance phase set up the medals as American Jimmy Wofford had the best ride, followed by his teammate Michael Page, and Britain’s Richard Meade. However, France’s Jean-Jacques Guyon moved into the lead after the endurance ride, followed by Wofford, Britain’s Derek Allhusen, and then Meade and Page. Defending gold medalist Mauro Checcoli of Italy was eliminated in the endurance ride.
Guyon finished only in a tie for 16th in the jumping with 10.25 faults, but it was enough to secure him the gold medal. The jumping was led by France’s Jean Sarrazin and Ireland’s Diana Wilson, who both had clean rides.

Canada’s top entrant was the reigning World Champion, Cindy Klassen, who had also lowered the World Record earlier in the season to 3:55.75. Kristina Groves and Clara Hughes, the other Canadians, were also established distance skaters.
But the first skater to break the 2005 track record (4:05.16 by Friesinger) was Dutch youngster Ireen Wüst. Considered more of a middle distance skater, she set a surprising new personal best, with 4:02.43. The first favourite to race was Claudia Pechstein, but she could not follow Wüst’s pace, and finished three seconds back. Cindy Klassen managed to start faster than the Dutchwomen, and held on to the fastest split until halfway. She then gradually lost her speed, finishing in 4:04.37. In her last lap, Klassen was overtaken by 2002 runner-up, Renate Groenewold, whose last lap put her a second ahead of the Canadian, but also a second behind her own team mate, Wüst. The final pairs did not change the medal order, as Friesinger, Groves, Hughes and Czech junior Sáblíková were all slower.

There was a minor change in the format, as the last several Olympics had two groups of 6 teams each, with eight teams advancing to a knockout stage. In Tokyo the groups were changed into three groups of 4 teams each, again with eight teams entering the single elimination phase.
The United States had won gold in 2008, 2012, and 2016 but seemed more vulnerable in 2021. The COVID-19 pandemic had forced the NBA season to start later and finish only the week before the Olympics. With that late finish many of the best American players elected not to compete at the Olympics. In addition, in pre-Olympic games, both Nigeria and Australia defeated the USA men, and the United States’ Olympic dominance seemed in danger.
One other change was that long-time Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski, who had coached the United States’ team at the last three Olympics, had stepped down, with the NBA’s San Antonio Spurs coach Gregg Popovich now in charge. It was likely a minor change as Popovich was one of the greatest coaches in NBA annals.
Once in Tokyo, France defeated the United States in the first group match, 83-76, further inflaming their critics. France went on to win Group A, while the USA finished second but still advanced to the knockout rounds. The other groups were won by Australia and Slovenia, which was led by 2019 NBA Rookie of the Year Luka Dončić, who scored 48 points again Argentina in their group match-up.
Sparked by Kevin Durant, who would win his third gold medal, the USA won their quarter-final over Spain, 95-81 and then beat Australia quite comfortably in the semi-finals, seemingly getting stronger with each game. In the other half of the bracket, France defeated Italy and then Slovenia to earn a re-match with the Americans. The final was relatively close, but the United States was in charge the entire second half and finally won gold by 87-82. Australia defeated Slovenia, 107-93, to take the bronze medal, giving the Aussies their first Olympic medal in men’s basketball after four fourth-place finishes (1988, 1996, 2000, 2016).

The answer, perhaps unsurprisingly, was no.
The Hungarians won 106 of their 122 bouts as their six-man team, which included fencers who had won or would go to win 30 Olympic medals, convincingly retained their Olympic title.
Italy and Germany won silver and bronze respectively.

There were several rounds that qualified 16 fencers for the semi-finals. They consisted of individual bouts among the fencers, but a jury decided on who would advance, rather than going strictly by the results of matches. In the semi-finals and finals, round-robin pools were conducted, and here the match results did determine the placements. The semi-finals consisted of two pools of eight fencers each, with the top four in each pool advancing to the final. France’s Émile Coste won this event by winning 6 of his 7 matches in the final pool. Henri Masson was second with 5 wins and 2 losses. There were also a consolation pool of the semi-finalists that did not make the final pool, so that the fencers were ranked from 1-16 based on the final and consolation pools.

Since the 2004 Olympics both women had married, and Misty was now Misty May-Treanor, married to major league baseball player Matt Treanor. Walsh married pro beach player Casey Jennings, but was still known only as Kerri Walsh. As they had in 2004, May-Treanor/Walsh played 7 matches and 14 sets, and won them all. But in general the matches were closer than they had been in 2008. The final was played in a downpour against the Chinese pair of Tian Jia and Wang Jie, a rematch of the 2007 World Championships final. Tian and Wang led the first set at 18-17, but May-Treanor and Walsh won the last four points to prevail, 21-18. The Americans got an early lead in the second set, but the Chinese pulled back to lead 9-8. However, May-Treanor and Walsh had too much in the end and won, 21-18, 21-18. The second Chinese team of Xue Chen and Zhang Xi won the bronze medal.
