Between 1984 and 1988 Djibouti, which previously had no athletics history, developed several leading marathon talents, led by Ahmed Salah. Two non-Africans also impressed, with Australia’s Rob de Castella winning Boston in 1986 in 2-07:51, and the Commonwealth Games gold medal that same year. Italy’s Gelindo Bordin won the gold medal at the 1986 European Championships.
The race started quite early, 2:30 PM, beneath a warm sun. The course started and finished at the Olympic Stadium, and looped out-and-back along the Han-Gang River. The weather led to a slow pace and at 25 km. the lead pack still had 13 runners. By 30 km. a group of six separated themselves and would contest the medals. Bordin and Salah were in this group, but de Castella had been distanced. At 40 km. Salah led, followed by Kenya’s Douglas Wakiihuri, and then Bordin. But over the next kilometer, run downhill, Bordin passed Wakiihuri and Salah and held on to win the gold medal, with Wakiihuri getting silver, and Salah bronze. The margin of 15 seconds was the smallest in an Olympic marathon since 1920.

Germany lowered that in the third quarter-final, overtaking New Zealand in 4:10.980, but Australia answered that in the final quarter-final, recording 4:10.438 as they overtook Czechoslovakia. Germany scared the mark in the first semi-final, defeating Denmark with a time of 4:10.446. Australia won the second semi to set up a dream final. In that match both teams bettered the record. But Germany broke out to an early lead and Australia could never make up the deficit, Germany winning the gold medal, 4:08.791 to 4:10.218. There was no bronze medal race. Denmark was awarded the bronze based on being the fastest losing semi-finalist.

In fact, they had never won an Olympic medal in the event, and their only major international win had come in 1959 when Buddy Werner triumphed on the Hahnenkamm. A few weeks before Sarajevo there was nothing to suggest this would change, until Bill Johnson won the Lauberhorn in Wengen, Switzerland. Known as a good glider, but not so good on a difficult course with lots of turns, the Sarajevo downhill set up perfectly for him.
The race had difficulty starting as it was postponed three times and seven days because of heavy snows. After Johnson had several of the best training runs, he was a slight favorite, and starting in sixth position, he posted the best time which held up for the gold medal. Asked later what this meant to him, he responded, “Millions!” Johnson would win two more World Cup downhills in 1984, at Aspen and Whistler in March, but never again won a major race after 1984. His victory was derided by the European skiers, who claimed he only won because the course was easy, to which Johnson asked, “If it was so easy, why didn’t they win it?” Johnson was a cocky, controversial character who had a very short period in the skiing limelight. He attempted a comeback for the 2002 Winter Olympics, but crashed during the US Championships in 2001 and sustained significant brain damage, spending several weeks in a coma. He never fully recovered and requires constant day-to-day care.

Given that lead the US was never headed, with all four US runners breaking 50 seconds, the lead increasing to the anchor leg, on which Monique Hennagan eased slightly to win by 10 metres. Russia ran second throughout the race, with their anchor, Nataliya Antyukh, running the fastest leg of the race, 49.43. Jamaica was well clear of Great Britain for the bronze medal.

They defeated the French team quite handily, 4-0, and did not play again. In that match they played a 2-3-5 formation and were led by J. Nicholas, who scored two goals in the first half and then retired with a sprained ankle. An Upton Park FC was founded in 1866 and was one of the 15 teams to play in the first FA Cup in 1871-72. The original club folded in 1887, but in 1891 a local club, Belmont FC, adopted the Upton Park name.
The French team titularly represented the Union des Sociétés Françaises de Sports Athlétiques (USFSA), but that was really just an administrative group governing several sports, and the team members appear to have come from various clubs. France defeated Belgium easily, by 6-2. The Belgium team is listed in many sources as representing the University of Brussels, but the University Archivist denies this and, in fact, the Belgian footballers also represented many different clubs, as well as the Universities of Liège, Louvain, and Brussels. Matches between the French squad and German and Swiss teams did not take place as those nations did not send squads to Paris.

The Frenchman performed poorly in his other events and, after the British food had proved too much for his stomach, was too ill to compete in the 1500m. This left the way clear for the seventeen year old American schoolboy, James McLane, and the previously unconsidered Australian John Marshall  to battle for the gold. McLane started well and maintained a lead for the first thousand metres. With 500m to go Marshall made his challenge and the two men swam stroke for stroke for the next two lengths of the pool. The Australian’s challenge faded and more technically gifted McLane swam away to become the first American to win the event since Antwerp.

France’s Olivier Clergeau took the early lead, and led after the second and fourth phases, tied going into the run with Velizar Iliev, the Bulgarian-born American. American Chad Senior led after three phases, but struggled with his horse in the riding, as it made refusals three times in the jumping. Deleigne was the best runner but he was in ninth place after four phases, 171 points behind, and although he won the cross-country, he would finish fourth overall.

Other skaters were not considered to have much of a chance, especially since Ballangrud had tied the legendary World Record of Oscar Mathisen, 2:17.4, at the World Championships in Davos (Switzerland). All other fast times of the season had also been posted by Norwegians: Harry Haraldsen, Charles Mathiesen and Hans Engnestangen.
Ballangrud was the first of the top skaters to ride, and his pair with Leo Freisinger (USA) was a great duel. The two skaters exchanged the lead a few times, with Ballangrud leading at the last turn. Freisinger was looking to close in with a final inner curve, but could not keep up, and the Norwegian posted 2:20.2. Another close pair followed, between Mathiesen and Max Stiepl of Austria. A silver medallist in the 1500 m at the European Championships, Mathiesen kept a high tempo, being trailed by Stiepl for the first two laps. He then took off, while keeping his 1 second lead on Ballangrud. His 2:19.2 was an excellent time, and a new Olympic Record - Ballangrud was beaten, the surprise of the day. Harry Haraldsen then seemed to be blazing towards a top position as well, but this was mostly caused by his poor opponent. He caught Belgian Charles de Ligne on the final straightaway, a very rare occurrence in an event of just under four laps. In fact, De Ligne is the worst speed skater in Olympic history. His times in the 500 m (with fall), 1500 m and 5000 m (disqualified) are the worst ever recorded at the Olympics, while the ice in Garmisch-Partenkirchen was of good quality. Only one skater has done worse than De Ligne, in the 10000 m. However, Buddy Solem (USA) had the misfortune of skating on a thawing rink at the 1948 Games.
The top four times were secure until the next to last pair, which included Birger Wasenius, winner of the silver medal the day before. He kept up with the pace of the leading Norwegian couple until 700 metres, but then had to yield. He was trailing Freisinger’s third position with a lap to go, but closed that gap to win his second medal of the Games.

Katie Ledecky had won the World Championship in 2013, 2015, and 2017, but had to withdraw from the event at the 2019 Worlds because of illness. She had also set the last six world records in the event and had the 23 fastest times ever swum, marking her a prohibitive favorite.
The only possible problem for Ledecky was that she was swimming the 1,500 final on 28 August, less than 75 minutes after she had swum the 200 free final, in which she finished fifth. Ledecky led the qualifying by six seconds over China’s Wang Jianjiahe, with American Erica Sullivan setting a PR to qualify third in 15:46.67.
The final was dominated by Ledecky as she never trailed and eventually won the first gold medal in this event by over four seconds. Wang was in second for the first half of the race, but then Germany’s Sarah Kohler took over second. Over the last 200 metres Erica Sullivan came back on Kohler, and passed her with only 3 laps remaining. Sullivan would hold on for silver in a big PR by over 5 seconds, as the USA went 1-2. Kohler maintained her position for the bronze as Wang finished fourth.
For Sullivan, a medal in Tokyo was special as her mother was Japanese and Erica spoke the language fluently. Ledecky’s gold medal was her 7th gold and 10th overall medal at the Olympics.

The nation provided over half of the top 20 horse and rider combinations in the FEI’s top 20 rankings with Isabelle Werth alone listed with 4 separate horses in the top dozen. In many ways, competition between the German riders for a place on the team was harder than the Olympic Games itself. It seemed the only threat to the German riders was the delay in hosting the Games from 2020 to 2021, which may have pushed their horses past the peak of the career. This was proved not to be the case in Tokyo.
Riding to music from the Hollywood musical “LaLaLand”, Jessica von Bredow-Werndl and the horse TSF Dalera broke through the 90% mark for the first ever time in any competition to claim the Olympic title on her first attempt. The pair scored perfect 10s for their piaffe, transitions, and halt. Behind her came Werth and the remarkable 17-year-old Belle Rose. The horse had been aimed for the Rio Olympics, but injury kept her out of the sport for four years until making a triumphant comeback at the 2018 World Equestrian Games. Werth matched Aladar Gerevich and Birgit Fischer-Schmidt by winning gold medals in six Olympic Games with her part in the team victory. For Werth and Gerevich, this was achieved in consecutive Olympics.
The reigning champion Charlotte Dujardin had campaigned Mount Saint James Freestyle towards Tokyo, but the horse’s dislike for hot conditions caused her to replace the horse with a younger alternative, Gio, before the Games. She edged out Denmark’s Cathrine Dufour for the bronze medal. At the age of 66, Australia’s Mary Hanna was the oldest competitor in any sport at the Tokyo Olympics.

He cruised through the heat and semi-final, each time marking his nearest rival until a finishing kick asserted his dominance to both crowd and opponents. Weissmuller lost time to a poor start and although he trailed the surprise of the event, István Bárány of Hungary, early in the race, the American moved ahead only for the Hungarian to surge again and close the gap on the leader. Weissmuller’s superior turning technique gained him time on his rival and he moved away to victory. It should be mentioned that a conflicting report on the race states that Weissmuller actually lost time coming out of the turn as he swallowed a large gulp of water and became briefly disorientated before regaining his composure. He trained for the Los Angeles Games of 1932 but he was enticed by Hollywood and went to play the part of “Tarzan” in motion pictures for the next fifteen years. Although his acting abilities were somewhat limited, he remains to this day an iconic figure in movie history. This was Weissmuller fifth and final Olympic gold, a tally neatly equalled by the number of his marriages. Walter Spence of Canada, who finished sixth, learned to swim in the rivers of Guyana and bore the scars left by numerous piranha bites.

Meanwhile China’s Kang Yue, the reigning World champion and 2013 and 2014 runner-up, floundered at the National Championships and was not selected for Rio. This left Rim Jong-Sim of North Korea as the favorite: she was the 2012 Olympic champion in the light-heavyweight division, but had taken bronze in 2014 and silver in 2015 at the Worlds in the heavyweight category. The only other recent World Championship medalist was Spain’s Lidia Valentín (bronze in 2013), who was also the 2014 and 2015 European champion and the 2013 runner-up. Valentín was a two-time Olympic veteran who finished fifth in 2008 and fourth in 2012, but was bumped up to the silver and gold medal positions respectively following a series of doping-related disqualifications. The reigning European champion was Iryna Dekha of Ukraine, while France’s Gaëlle Nayo-Ketchanke was the 2015 and 2016 runner-up.
Rim took a significant lead in the snatch portion with a lift of 121 kg. Trailing behind were Valentín and Belarus’ Darya Naumava at 116 kg and Dekha at 114 kg. In her first attempt at the clean and jerk, Rim lifted 145 kg, which was not only 9 more than anyone else in the opening round, but 3 more than any other competitor would lift in the entire competition. She secured her gold medal by lifting 153 kg in her next attempt and used her final lift to try and improve on the Olympic record, but failed. Valentín and Naumava, meanwhile, battled for silver, with the Belarusian coming out on top by 1 kg each round. Dekha, the only other competitor reasonably in contention for a podium spot, struggled in the clean and jerk and placed fifth overall, giving Valentín the bronze.

Ria and Peter married in 1951. They were also World and European champions in roller figure skating.
Ria and Peter Falk was favored for the gold medal in Oslo, and they did not disappoint their fans. This mature, elegant and creative pair was unbeaten as amateurs. At the Oslo Games Ria was 29 and Peter 30. They were the first pair showing side by side double jumps and the Lasso lift.

Greene was not in Paris but did make the US team for Athina, along with Justin Gatlin.

A few days later, it was revealed that Gatlin had tested positive in 2001 for an amphetamine, which was in a prescription medication he had taken for a decade. This should have been announced in his medical paper work, but was not, and the IAAF considered this only “a paperwork or technical violation.” He was suspended retroactively to 2001, but was reinstated by July 2002. In Athina, Gatlin won the gold medal in a very close race over Obikwelu (1/100th second), with Maurice Greene winning a bronze medal.

In addition, around 30 000 people gathered on “Gratishaugen” (“The free-of-charge-hill”), a hillside just outside the jumping hill where people could watch the jumpers from a distance without buying tickets.
The Norweigans had big hopes for success before the competition. The favorite was Torbjørn Falkanger, winner at Holmenkollen and national champion in 1949 and 1950. Another local hero was Arne Hoel, aged 24 and from Oslo, Holmenkollen was a real home ground for him. The most dangerous opponents were thought to come from Finland, Sweden and Germany. Finland’s leading jumpers were two 19-year old boys from Rovaniemi, Antti Hyvärinen and Tauno Luiro. The latter had set a new world distance record in Oberstdort in 1951 with an impressive jump of 139 metres, a record that would remain unbeaten for 10 years. Sweden had two excellent jumpers from Kiruna, Thure Lindgren (silver medalist in the 1950 World Championship) and Karl Holmström. Germany had two excellent athletes from the ski jumping center in Oberstdorf, Bavaria in Toni Brutscher and Sepp Weiler. Weiler, a veteran aged 31, was a former Wehrmacht soldier who had lost his left eye on the Russian front during the war.
There were 44 jumpers from 13 nations entered for the competition. Arnfinn Bergmann was the lowest ranked of the Norwegian jumpers although he had a bronze medal from the 1950 World Championships. He  took an early lead from his start number six with a stylish jump of 67,5 metres. Both the Swede Bror Östman and Toni Brutscher made solid jumps, but the young Finn Luiro failed badly. Nobody was able to beat Bergmann’s points before the last of the Norwegians, Falkanger was ready with start number 38. Under big ovations from the audience he landed a stylish jump safely at 68 metres, and Bergmann was relegated to second place. Later jumpers Hyvärinen and Weiler both made good jumps, but could not prevent the Norwegian double after the first round. The competition was very close as the difference in points between the first ten was only five.
In the second round, Bergmann got a perfect jump, equalling Falkanger’s 68 metres from the first round and had even better style points than his countryman. Most of the following jumpers were not able to match their distances from the first round. Östman fell, Norwegians Arne Hoel (63,5) and Halvor Næs (64,5) made good jumps and improved. Brutscher jumped 62,5 metres  and equaled Næs for second place in total points. Holmström made a solid jump and took over the silver medal position. Falkanger had great pressure on his shoulders and jumped only 64 metres, but good style points kept him ahead of Holmström, although behind Bergmann. Hyvärinen, lying in bronze medal position after the first round, could do only 61,5 metres and ended up in seventh place. The end was indeed happy for the Norwegian crowd, Bergmann gold, Falkanger silver, and all four jumpers among the six best.
Both Bergmann and Falkanger continued their jumping career. Falkanger won his third Norwegian championship 1954, but fell badly at Holmenkollen in December 1955 in a qualification competition for the 1956 Winter Olympics and had to give up jumping due to his injuries. Bergmann also failed to qualify for the 1956 Winter Olympics, but won his third national championships in 1958.

Marshall, the Australian world record holder, failed to reach the final and although McLane and Furuhashi both reached the final they filled the final two positions. The battle for the gold came to be decided between Boiteux, Konno and Östrand. The Frenchman led by a small margin over his American rival with the Swede always behind but keeping up the pressure on the leaders. Mindful of Konno’s noted sprint finish, Boiteux made his effort at the 200m mark. By 300m he held pulled out a second on Konno but the American began to fight back. Konno surged back and nearly brought himself level but with fifteen metres to go the American faltered and Boiteux held on to win. Östrand held on to finish third.

Hveger pushed out to a lead and tried to shake off the presence of the Dutch swimmer but it was to no avail and Mastenbroek sprinted ahead with less than ten metres left to win her third gold of the Games. Mastenbroek later told of an incident that happened during before one of the earlier races of the Games. Hveger was handing out chocolates to some of the other swimmers but not to Mastenbroek. This angered the Dutchwoman who was determined to get her “revenge” in the 400m race.
Hveger would go on to dominate the European Championships in London in 1938 and set world bests at both freestyle and backstroke before her retirement. Coming out of retirement to compete in the Helsinki she was still good enough at the age of 32 to reach the final of the 400 metre freestyle.

Another Finn, Harri Kirvesniemi, was in the lead after 5.8 km, six seconds ahead of the new 22-year-old Swedish cross-country star Gunde Svan. The Finns were doing well, Aki Karvonen in third position, only two seconds behind Svan, and Mieto followed in fourth place, ahead of the 30 km winner Nikolay Zimyatov.

Mieto was still fourth, 20 seconds behind. Zimyatov had slowed down to eighth, 50 seconds behind the young Swedish leader.

Although in truth, since the difference in weight between the two divisions was only a single kilogramme due to the restructuring of the Olympic programme, this was less controversial to the national federations than it could have been.
The long-range favourite, 2016 bantamweight champion Robeisy Ramírez, defected to the USA in summer 2018 to pursue a professional career. Although this did not necessarily rule him of out of Tokyo, the enmity it earned from the Cuban government meant his Olympic career was ended.
Mirazizbek Mirzakhalilov of Uzbekistan, as reigning world champion, was the top seed with Albert Batyrgaziyev, a Russian convert from kickboxing, seeded to meet him in the final but the Uzbek was eliminated in his first bout against Irishman Kurt Walker.
From the quarter-finals onwards, each bout was close and hotly contested with only the semi-final between American Duke Ragan and Samuel Takyi of Ghana being decided by anything but a 3-2 split decision by the judges. Ragan and Batyrgaziev faced off for the gold medal in the first Olympic final in which both boxers had professional experience. The Russian won the first two rounds on the majority of scorecards with his controlled aggression and although Ragan rallied in the later stages he failed to convince three of the five judges to score in his favour. Lázaro Álvarez of Cuba won his third successive bronze medal – all in different weight classes.

He had two close matches in the quarter-final and semi-final against Australia’s Taylor Worth and American Brady Ellison respectively, winning both with one-arrow tie-breakers after 5-5 ties. Ku also needed five sets against Jean-Charles Valladont in the final despite looking like the easy winner after three sets. He had already celebrated victory, when one of Valladont’s arrows was upgraded in score,  bringing the overall score to 5-1 and reviving the Frenchman’s hopes. Valladont won the fourth set to get to within two points of Ku at 3-5, but some eights by the Frenchman enabled the Korean to get back on the winning track as Ku took the fifth set 27-26 and with it the gold medal. Brady Ellison took bronze after beating his neighbour in the world ranking list, the Netherland’s Sjef van den Berg, 6-2. This was Ellison’s first individual medal after two team silver medals in 2012 and 2016. Another Korean, Kim Woo-Jin, who set new World and Olympic records in the ranking round, was beaten in the last 32 by Riau Ega Agatha from Indonesia. Kim, who came to Rio as top of the world rankings, was one of two of the top six ranked archers not to reach the semi-final, despite his impressive performance in the ranking round.

West won the two intervening European Championships and the World Championships, with their most recent European squad of Peter Berger, Hans-Johann Färber, Gerhard Auer, Alois Bierl, and Uwe Benter representing the nation in Munich. East had been the runners-up at both Europeans and sent a new lineup to the 1972 Games. Norway had been the world runners-up in 1970, while the Soviet Union had taken bronze there and at the 1971 European Championships. Switzerland had captured bronze at the 1969 edition.
As expected, the two Germanys took charge of the opening round, winning their heats along with Switzerland. The Soviet Union put forth an impressive effort in the semi-finals, besting East Germany in their heat, while West Germany cruised to an easier victory in its own heat. The West Germans, however, had saved their best for the final and won the gold medal in record time, leaving their Eastern counterparts to settle for silver. The Soviet Union, meanwhile, lagged and was outperformed by the Czechoslovakians, who stole the bronze medal. The Czechoslovakian crew included Vladimír Petříček, who won a silver medal in the coxed pairs at the same Games.

In his absence, Austrian Felix Gottwald was expected to challenge Lajunen, having won the 2000-01 World Cup. And in the 2001-02 World Cup, Gottwald was in a close battle for the lead with German Ronny Ackermann.

Tallus went off 53 seconds ahead of Lajunen, 1:08 ahead of Ackermann, and with a 2:43 margin on Gottwald. Lajunen caught Tallus on the second lap (of three) and pulled ahead to win the gold medal by 24.7, Tallus hanging on for the silver. Gottwald had the fastest ski time, but never challenged either of the Finns, although he did move onto the podium for a bronze medal. Ackermann would finish fourth, but would best Gottwald in the 2001-02 World Cup race, and win that title again in 2002-03, as well as winning the 2003 World Championship.

The extrovert hurdler Lolo Jones had been at the centre of the media furore but it was Lauryn Williams, a member of the US team that won gold in the 4×100 metre relay at London 2012 who stood at the brink of a historic triumph. Only once in the history of the Olympic Games had an athlete won gold at both Summer and Winter Games – was Eddie Eagan’s unique feat about to be matched after 82 years?
The US team had switched pairings throughout the season but when the Olympic selection was announced she found herself partnering Elana Meyers, the silver medal winner from the 2013 World Championships, and therefore in a strong position to challenge for the title.  Their main rivals appeared to be the reigning Olympic champion combination of Canadians Kaillie Humphries and Heather Moyse who were back together again after Moyse had spent most of the intervening Olympiad competing for Canada internationally at both rugby and cycling.
Meyers and Williams used their trademark explosive start to shine on the first day of competition and, whilst Meyers’ driving may not have been up to the standard of her Canadian rival, they recorded the fastest times on both runs. The Canadians responded by posting the best time on run 3 but the American team still maintained a healthy lead of .11 of a second as they entered the final run. Humphries had a clean and fast ride down the track on her 4th run putting pressure back on the American duo. Meyers and Williams made an excellent start but halfway down the run it deteriorated into a game of pinball between the walls of ice. They recovered a little but the damage was done and the Canadians became the first women to successfully retain an Olympic title. Whilst Williams didn’t quite join Eddie Eagan in the ranks of Olympic immortals, she did have the satisfaction of being only the 3rd woman after Clara Hughes and Christa Luding-Rothenburger to medal in both summer and winter. Jamie Greubel drove USA II into the bronze medal position ahead of a Dutch team which recorded its best result in Olympic bobsleigh by placing 4th.
In May 2016 WADA (World Anti-Doping Agency) commissioned a report, the McLaren Report, to look into allegations of systematic Russian doping and a cover-up to avoid positives at the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics. The report was released in two parts, in July and December 2016, and confirmed the allegations. In 2017 the IOC formed a commission to investigate this, headed by IOC Member Denis Oswald, and usually referred to as the Oswald Commission. In late October 2017 the Oswald Commission began to release its findings.
Olga Stulneva and Lyudmila Udobkina, who originally finished ninth, were disqualified in November-December 2017. Appeals were made immediately to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS), which are ongoing.
A special committee of the International Bobsleigh and Skeleton Federation (IBSF) was then charged with investigating these findings, but refused to acknowledge the disqualifications and allowed all the sliders to continue competing. The IOC was not happy with that ruling and the Executive Committee of the IBSF then appealed to the CAS, against its own sub-committee, to have that ruling overturned.

This duo won their heat in the opening round, but the other heat winners, Sweden and Hungary, had faster times. Sweden’s lineup included Agneta Andersson, who, in her sixth edition of the Games, was an Olympic champion in this event from 1984, as well as the 1993 World Champion, and was joined by Susanne Gunnarsson, who had helped Andersson take silver in the event at the 1992 Games. Hungary, meanwhile, had Rita Kőbán, whose six World titles did not include the K-2 500, but who was considered a serious contender nonetheless and was partnered with Szilvia Mednyánszki. Hungary defeated Germany in the semi-finals, while Sweden took the other heat, but in the final it looked as if Germany was going to take the gold medal without too much difficulty. In the final stretch, however, Sweden unleashed a powerful drive and passed the Germans, nabbing the title by a margin of 0.36 seconds and leaving their opponents with silver. Thus, after having won the K-4 500, Fischer and Portwich failed to become double Olympic champions at the Games, while Andersson added gold to the bronze that she had won in that event. Australians Anna Wood and former German Katrin Borchert, meanwhile, stole bronze from the Hungarians by 0.252 seconds.

Ties broken by lightest bodyweight.,na,"The women’s light-heavyweight competition at the 2012 Summer Olympics was one of the rare weightlifting events with no Chinese participants and thus no favorite from that nation. Oksana Slivenko of Russia, the 2008 Olympic silver medalist, three time European Champion (2007, 2011, and 2012), three time World Champion (2006, 2007, 2011), and once runner-up (2009), was believed to be the favorite in the event, but injured herself in a training accident and did not compete in London. Her withdrawal left the field wide open, with Roxana Cocoș of Romania, runner-up at the most recent World Championships, and Huang Shih-Chun of Chinese Taipei, the reigning Asian Champion, in the best positions to win the crown.
The top score in the snatch competition, 115 kg, went to three participants, Rim Jong-Sim of North Korea, Anna Nurmukhambetova of Kazakhstan, and Dina Sazanovets of Belarus, none of whom had medals from a major international tournament. In the clean and jerk, Marina Shkermankova, also of Belarus, took an early lead with a lift of 135 kg that tacked on to her 113 kg lift from the snatch. She was quickly passed by Sazanovets and Nurmukhambetova, who each added 136 kg to their total, giving the Belarusian the advantage as the lighter competitor. Cocoș then joined them with 138 kg lift and, with an even lower body weight, moved into the gold medal position. Next came a string of failures at the 140 kg level, with Nurmukhambetova and Meline Daluzyan of Armenia, European Champion in 2007 and 2008 and runner-up in 2010, both unable to lift the weight, exhausting the Kazakh’s remaining attempts and leaving her in third place. Shkermankova, meanwhile, was successful at this weight and passed the Romanian, but was quickly bested by her compatriot, who lifted 141 kg. Rim then arrived with a successful lift of 142 kg, securing her lead, while Daluzyan got one final shot at the podium by attempting this weight. She was unsuccessful and thus failed to post a score. Next up were Cocoș and Shkermankova, who lifted 143 kg to tie Sazanovets and enter the silver and bronze medal positions respectively by virtue of bodyweight. This is where they would remain, with Cocoș failing at her 146 kg attempt and Rim succeeding with hers, thus earning the title of Olympic champion.
That was how the event and the results seemed to have ended. In 2015, however, the IOC began re-testing samples from the 2008 Beijing and 2012 London Olympics, using newer, more advanced testing techniques, in an effort to find those who had used performance enhancing drugs (PEDs), but in whom it could not be detected at the time of those Olympics. This was one of the many events affected. Every women’s weightlifting event at the 2012 London Olympics, except flyweight (≤ 48 kg), was affected by positive re-tests.
In October 2016 the third- and fourth-place finishers, Belarussians Marina Shkermankova and Dina Sazanovets, were disqualified after positive re-tests for anabolic steroids. The bronze medal was re-assigned to Kazakh lifter Anna Nurmukhambetova. Then in November 2020, after re-testing of samples from London. Romania’s silver medalist Roxana Cocoș’s samples produced an anti-doping rule violation (ADRV) and she was disqualified, removing her silver medal. In June 2021 Colombia’s Ubaldina Valoyes was advanced to third-place and scheduled to receive a bronze medal; however, because Nurmukhambetova was by then serving a suspension for use of PEDs, she was not advanced to the silver medal, leaving two bronze medals in this event (as of June 2021).

The 2013/14 World Cup season was her first full World Cup season since 2008/09. The week before this event started, Tsuper announced that this was it – she would retire after Sochi. However, the heavy favorite was China’s Li Nina, who led the season’s World Cup standings, had won the World Championship in 2005, 2007, and 2009, and had won silvers in this event at Torino and Vancouver.
The aerials were conducted as a series of elimination races. Twelve of the 23 starters made it out of qualifying to the final, six qualifying on the first run and six on the second run. The 12 finalists skiied three runs, with eight advancing to the second run, and four to the final, medal run. Tsuper and Li both made it to the medal run, accompanied by Li’s teammate Xu Mengtao, and the defending champion, Australian Lydia Ierodiaconou-Lassila, now competing in her fourth Winter Olympics. Tsuper went first on the final run, and landed her back full-full-full perfectly, scoring 98.01. Li was next and when she fell on the landing of her back double-full, double-full, having to be helped off the snow by her trainer, it virtually guaranteed medals to the other skiiers. Ierodiaconou-Lassila and Xu both stumbled on their landings, giving the gold medal to Tsuper, despite their higher difficulty. Xu took the silver medal with Ierodiaconou-Lassila winning her second Olympic medal, a bronze.

Brazilian Laís Souza had competed at the 2004 and 2008 Olympics as a gymnast, but then turned to freestyle skiing, and had qualified for the aerials at Sochi. She would have been the first Olympic gymnast to ever compete at the Winter Olympics, but in late January, while training in Park City, Utah, Souza fell on a landing and broke her neck. She was paralyzed from the neck down despite surgery to stabilize her neck.

The defending champions, Nataliya Mishkutyonok and Artur Dmitriyev of Russia, were back but were not expected to defeat G&G. The 1993 World Champions were Isabelle Brasseur and Lloyd Eisler, but they had made a habit of placing second or third to Soviet or Russian couples. In the end, Gordeyeva and Grinkov again won the gold medal easily, winning both the short and long programs. Mishkutyonok and Dimitriyev placed second with Brasseur and Eisler again third. The Canadians were not happy with their marks in the free skate, despite an excellent program, Eisler commenting on television, “I couldn’t give a rat’s ass.” The 1993 World Champions, Mandy Wötzel and Ingo Steuer, skated poorly in the short program and were only eighth. During their free program, Wötzel fell on the ice during a lift, and was carried off the ice by Steuer, later receiving several stitches.

Two years later neither of the stars of Albertville, Toni Nieminen and Martin Höllwarth, could qualify for Lillehammer as both men suffered a disintegration of their form. The men who had replaced the two men at the top of the ski jumping rankings included 1993 world champion Masahiko Harada of Japan, the young Austrian Andi Goldberger and the German pair of Thoma and Weißflog. The biggest story of the 1994 ski jumping competition did not concern any of those previously but instead centered about the host nation’s Espen Bredesen. Bredesen’s Olympic debut in 1992 was a humiliating failure as he finished last on the small hill and 57th out of 59th on the large hill and he was heavily criticized at home in Norway. After initially struggling to cope with the switch from the classical to the V-technique his results quickly improved in the 1992-93 season and he won both titles at the Norwegian Championships, the Holmenkollen event, the large hill title at the World Championship and the Pre-Olympic test event.
His performance in Lillehammer was as sensational as his exploits in Albertville had been disastrous. Bredesen’s first round leap may not have been as long as that of fellow Norwegian Lasse Ottesen but his style marks came close to perfection and he led at halfway. The pressure for a home victory had already lifted when Bredesen stood at the start gate for his second jump as Ottesen had already guaranteed a Norwegian gold medal but Ottesen’s hopes for the title were thwarted when Bredesen hung in the air then landed safely at the 104 metre mark. For Norwegian ski jumping the result of this event came as a redemption following the events of Albertville which saw a Norwegian team record a series of disastrous performances as they struggled to make changes to the technical side of the sport. The bronze medal was won by Dieter Thoma of Germany but his margin over the next four jumpers was just 2.5 points.

The decisive run was Switzerland I’s third as they blazed down the track over a second faster than their rivals and ensured that victory would be a formality. A disastrous final run from Switzerland II eliminated them from medal contention so it was left to Eugenio Monti’s Italian crew to sneak past American veteran Art Tyler for the second place on the podium.
For winning pilot Franz Kapus, at 46 years of age and in his third Olympics, it was a fitting climax to his career. Kapus remains the oldest man to pilot a bob to Olympic gold and the second oldest, after 48 year old J.J. O’Brien, of any Olympic bobsleigh champion.

Jin would later win the free pistol in London, becoming the first shooter to win two gold medals at one Olympics since Unified Team shooter Marina Dobrancheva-Logvinenko in 1992, and only the second shooter to do so since 1924, back when there were numerous team events. In fact, Jin became only the seventh shooter to win two individual gold medals at one Olympics, following Dobrancheva-Logvinenko and five shooters from 1906-20.

The most notable absentee was Birgit Fischer, who had helped East Germany win all nine gold medals in women’s disciplines at the last three Worlds.

Andersson became an Olympic champion when she defeated West Germany’s Barbara Schüttpelz in the K-1 500 the day before this event’s final. Schüttpelz was partnered with Josefa Idem in this event, who was making the first of what would be eight appearances at the Olympics, a record number for a woman in any sport.
The opening heats were won by Sweden and the Canadian duo of Alexandra Barré and Sue Holloway, while the West Germans were third in Sweden’s heat, behind Romanians Nastasia Nichitov-Ionescu and Agafia Constantin, one of the 1981 World bronze medalists. Just as in the K-1 500, Sweden won gold with ease, with the closest crew being almost two seconds behind. The race for the remaining podium spots was a three-way battle between Canada, West Germany, and Romania, who crossed the finish line in that order with only 0.43 seconds between them. With Olsson’s help, Andersson would go on to earn a third Olympic medal, silver, in the K-4 500 the following day, while the Canadians would take bronze.

By 2008 the USA had established themselves as one of the strongest nations in the women’s side of the sport but success amongst male fencers had not matched that of American female fencers.
US hopes of a medal seemed sure to be thwarted when there were drawn against the Hungarian World Champions in the first round and when Keeth Smart took to the piste the Americans trailed Hungary 40-36. Smart then proceeded to win 9 of the next 13 to clinch an unlikely sudden death victory for his team. Amazingly Smart repeated the feat in the semi-final taking the USA from a five point deficit to another sudden death victory by 45-44 over Russia. What made Smart’s feat even more remarkable was that his comeback came against Stanislav Pozdnyakov, widely acknowledged as the best sabre fencer of his generation.
For the Americans the Olympic championship was one fairy tale too far and reality set in the form of Nicolas Lopez, Julien Pillet and Boris Sanson. Smart made one last effort to peg back the French lead but this time the margin was too much and France ran out winners by 45-37.

The Italian favourite rallied on the second run but at the end of day one it would be the British that held a narrow lead over the two Italian crews. That the British team were in this position was a tribute to the sportsmanship of Eugenio Monti   as when a bolt in the British bob was damaged beyond repair in the first run it was the Italian that provided a spare bolt for his rivals. Weather conditions deteriorated on the second day of competition and the third run was held before dawn in attempt to avoid an oncoming thaw. When the third run was completed the first two positions had changed and Zardini and Bonagura led the field with the British bob just 0.05 seconds behind but with Italy I also in a position to challenge for gold.

Nash and Dixon then retired to a nearby café and listened to the remaining runs via the course commentary system. Their first challengers were Italy II driven by Zardini but he also made a serious mistake on the Hexenkessel and dropped back to second 0.17 seconds behind the British.  This still left Monti’s Italy I bob with a chance of glory and he started his run well but when the course commentator exclaimed that “Monti, in den Hexenkessel… unhurig (unsteady)” his chances of an overdue Olympic title were over.

They would go on to win the 1965 World Championships and compete at a high level in the sport until the 1968 Winter Games despite competing for a nation which had no bob run. Sergio Zardini emigrated to Canada shortly after the Games and won the North American Championships for his adopted nation. He was fatally injured in a crash at Lake Placid in February 1966.

She was a decorated test pilot and female gliding pioneer, and became the first woman to compete in World Gliding Championships in 1955. Hungarian pilot Lajos Rotter set a new world record for longest predeclared flight, when he flew from Rangsdorf to Kiel (to see the Olympic sailing regatta), recording a distance of 336.5 km.

Whilst his times in London were well down on his record breaking performances he led the United States to a clean sweep of the podium positions. The superiority of the butterfly technique in this event was evident in the fact that only one of the finalists used the traditional breaststroke and he, Bob Bonte of Holland, finished eighth and last. Out of 32 entrants, 20 used the butterfly stroke including twelve of the sixteen semi-finalists. Artem Nakache of France, a veteran of the Berlin Games, bowed out in the semi-finals but his achievement in returning to the Olympic arena was remarkable. A Jew, he had been deported to Auschwitz in 1944 and his wife and daughter both died there.

The only ray of hope still left after the Italian women had been so dominant in sweeping the podium in the individual event was that they did the same thing at the 2011 World Championships before losing to Russia in the team final that year.
They pretty much demolished their British hosts and then France to set up a rematch with the Russians in the London final. This time there was to be no repeat for Russia and they never got a toehold in the gold medal contest. It was left to 38-year-old veteran Valentina Vezzali to deliver the coup de grace on Russia thereby helping Italy to the Olympic title and herself to a sixth career Olympic gold. She had won a medal in each of the nine Olympic events she contested between 1996 and 2012.
The bronze medal was won by South Korea, their first ever in Olympic team fencing.
Vezzali was elected to the Italian Parliament in 2013 as a member of the newly formed centrist Scelta Civica party led by former Prime Minister Mario Monti.

Luña led 29-15 after two rounds, only one point away from the bout being stopped automatically. But Williams stormed back to lead 35-31. In the fourth round, flagging from his comeback efforts, Williams held on to defeat Luña 42-41, holding on in the last 20 seconds once he had secured the lead.
At the 1999 World Championships Abdullayev had met Williams in the second round, winning 11-4. Sydney was more of the same, with Abdullayev jumping out to an early lead and maintaining it, winning the gold medal by decision, 27-20.
After the Olympics, Ricardo Williams turned pro but he had little success, never training properly. In 2005 he was arrested and convicted of conspiracy to traffic in cocaine and was sentenced to three years in jail. After serving 31 months, he was released and returned to professional boxing. Abdullayev also turned professional after Sydney, with a 21-4 record through 2011. In 2005 he fought for the WBO light-welterweight world title but lost to Miguel Cotto.

The big Norwegian star Thorleif Haug had won the classical Holmenkollen 50 km (the only cross country event in Holmenkollen until 1933, when the 18 km was included in the program) five times between 1918 and 1923, but in 1922 the Norwegians were shocked by a Finnish double, when Anton Collin and Tapani Niku outclassed the Norwegians and Haug had to be content with a modest 9th place. It was the first time that a non-Norwegian was able to win in Holmenkollen. Besides Collin and Niku, the Norwegians also feared their Swedish neighbours. The small and quiet Torkel Persson, a native Sami from Jämtland, was considered as the strongest in the team together with Per-Erik Hedlund from Särna, the starting point of another Nordic classical competition, Vasaloppet.
The 33 competitors were met with cold and windy conditions when the first starter, the Frenchman André Blusset was sent away at 8:37 AM. The skiers started with intervals of one minute in a one-lap course with a really demanding height difference of 820 meters. First of the favorites was Collin with number 3, chased by the Norwegian Johan Grøttumsbraaten 1 minute behind. The big favorite Haug started as number 23, chasing Niku 2 minutes ahead of him.
Already in the early stages of the race, it was clear that this would be a great day for the Norwegians. Collin broke one of his skies and had to give up. Grøttumsbraaten had a 1.30 lead over Haug after  20 km, followed by Matti Raivio, Hedlund, Niku and the two other Norwegians, Jon Mårdalen and Thoralf Strømstad. 10 km later all four Norwegians were in front. Haug had overtaken Grøttumsbraaten by one minute, with Strømstad 7 and Mårdalen 8 minutes behind. Niku and Hedlund were fading, 15 and 16 minutes behind Haug, and both gave up shortly after. Strømstad was fastest in the last stage of the race and passed Grøttumsbraaten, but Haug kept his lead to the finish, and his victory margin to Strømstad was a clear 1.51. Mårdalen finished his last 20 km 6 minutes faster than Grøttumsbraaten, but had to be content with 4th place. Persson in 5th place was 16 minutes behind Mårdalen, and all 8 skiers from the Nordic countries that finished the race took the 8th first places. The Italians were the best of the Middle Europeans, placing 9-10-11-13.
The Norwegian journalist Finn Amundsen, later a famous sports commentator for Norwegain radio, wired an enthusiastic report home to his paper Idrætsliv under the heading “Vi viste verden vinterveien!” (We showed the world the winter way!), later to become a famous slogan for Norwegian winter sports.

Norway, which had struggled somewhat during the Round Robin, came back with renewed vigor during the tie-breaking matches and defeated Sweden and the United States to earn a spot in the playoffs.

Groß fell and lost a lot of time, finishing his leg in only 12th place, with the lead held by Finland, followed by Sweden and the Unified Team. Germany moved up to fifth after the second leg, with Sweden leading the Unified Team. But on the third leg Mark Kirchner had the fastest leg of the event, 20:17.5, almost a minute ahead of the Unified’s third skier, and it pulled Germany into a lead they would hold to the line to win the gold medal. Although Sergey Chepikov was skiing the last leg for the Unified Team, he lost more ground to Fritz Fischer, who was comfortably ahead at the end, and skied the last 50 metres carrying a German flag. Germany was the first nation other than the Soviet Union to the win the men’s biathlon relay at the Olympics.

She already had a bronze from 2012 and silver from 2016 Olympics, and was hoping for gold in Tokyo, but had to beat some extremely good divers if she was to achieve that aim. China’s Chen Yuxi, the 2019 platform world champion, was favorite for Tokyo gold, with her team-mate Quan Hongchan also a medal probability.
The two Chinese divers did dominate the preliminary round, with Chen leading all the way, beating Quan by more than 26 points, with 2019 world champion bronze medallist Delaney Schnell of the United States in third. The 2008 Beijing synchronised platform silver medallist Melissa Wu of Australia qualified in fourth place, with Canada’s 2016 Rio bronze medallist Meaghan Benfeito in fifth. Rinong just managed to qualify in 18th place after being out of the qualifying positions with one dive remaining.
Quan and Chen dominated yet again in the semi-finals, with the third best qualifier, Schnell, 65 points behind second placed Chen. It was no different in the final as 14-year-old Quan led after every dive with Chen in the silver medal position after each dive. Chen performed one magnificent dive after another and received 24 out of a possible 35 maximum 10s, including the maximum score from all seven judges on dives two and four. Quan won by more than 40 points while Chen was 54 points in front of Australia’s Melissa Wu, who had held the bronze medal position from the third dive onwards.
China won their fourth consecutive individual platform gold medal and ended the women’s diving competition by winning all the four gold medals and two silver medals available it was possible to win. Of the 24 women’s diving gold medals that had been on offer since 2004 when the synchronized events were introduced, China has won 21 of them.

Adlington did not disappoint and the race gradually turned into one between the Briton and Janet Evans’ world record which had stood since 1989.

But this was not a given in 2012. The best American one-lap runners over the last decade had been LaShawn Merritt, the defending gold medalist, and Jeremy Wariner, the 2004 gold medalist. But Wariner failed to make the Olympic team, and Merritt pulled up in the first round in London, the victim of a bad hamstring.
This left the event wide open, but the favorite, despite Merritt and Wariner’s status, had been the Grenadan 2011 World Champion, Kirani James. Many eyes were also looking to see how well the South African Oscar Pistorius would do. Nicknamed “The Blade Runner”, the bilateral amputee ran on artificial limbs, and had won numerous titles at the Paralympics. Pistorius had made the Olympic qualifying time, although there was some controversy about his running, as some experts felt his blades gave him extra propulsion and could give him an advantage. If so, they were not enough, as he was last in semi-final two, won by James. The other semis were won by Trindadian Lalonde Gordon and Luguelín Santos of the Dominican Republic, the 2012 World Junior Champion.
The final was also notable for the presence of Belgian twins Kevin Borlée, the 2010 European Champion, and Jonathan Borlée, who had just missed a European record when he won his heat in 44.43, and the absence of the American runners. No American qualified for the final for the first time at the Olympics save for the boycott year of 1980.  The early leader in the final was Bahamian Demetrius Pinder but he was caught by James before the halfway mark. James led at 200 in 21.3 followed by Santos in 21.4, and James would only increase his lead to the tape, winning gold in 43.94, with a 5-metre lead on Santos, Gordon coming for the bronze medal. The Borlées placed 5-6, with Kevin leading his brother, and Pinder faded to seventh.
This was the first ever Olympic gold medal in any sport by a Grenadian athlete. The podium was also unusual in that the three athletes all represented three different Caribbean nations, the first time this had ever happened at the Olympics. James’ time also made him the first non-American to run under 44 seconds, and at only 19 years, 11 months, he was the second youngest ever under that barrier, behind only 1988 Olympic champion Steve Lewis.

Unlike the 1896 Olympics, it could be said that all the top hurdlers were present, mainly because Al Kraenzlein was so dominant that he had no real peer.
The heats bore no surprises, as the favored Kraenzlein qualified easily.  In the final, the first real problem with the inexperienced French starter Meier, occurred.  John McLean caught a flyer, and according to reports, was ahead of Kraenzlein by five yards off the blocks.  But Kraenzlein was so superior that he caught McLean at the eighth hurdle and ran away to win by three yards.  McLean did hold onto second place, however, just edging out Fred Moloney, who had beaten McLean easily in a first-round heat.
Kraenzlein’s win in the 110 metres hurdles was the first of his four individual gold medals, a record which has still never been equalled in track & field athletics.  The distance of 110 metres was rarely run in either Britain or the United States, as they used the slightly shorter Imperial equivalent of 120 yards.  Thus, Kraenzlein’s mark of 15.6 and his final mark of 15.4 were world records for the metric distance, although both were intrinsically inferior to his record of 15.2 for 120 yards hurdles.

This meant that they had to shoot very quickly as there was a time limit to fire the required 60 rounds. Boa shot first and scored 598, dropping a point in his first and last strings. He was bettered by Vasily Borisov (URS), who recorded a 599. With little time to spare, Ouellette fired off 60 shots, almost in rapid-fire fashion, and scored a perfect 600. At first considered a world record, the course was re-measured and found to be 1.5 metres short of 50 metres, thus disqualifying the mark as a record. Ouellette would compete in the Olympics again, but not until 1968. The Americans did not fare well, but noted that nearly everyone in the event used the new U.S. ammunition that had just been developed, Western Supermatch Mark III.

Originally some of the first round matches were to be played in open seawater venues at Uunisaari and Humallahti. However, this had to be abandoned because the water temperature was too cold to allow competition at those venues. The change required that all the matches had to be re-scheduled and shifted to the outdoor fresh-water Olympic Swim Stadium, Helsingin Uimastadion.
The Netherlands had won the 1950 European Championship, after having placed fourth at the 1948 Olympics. Italy was the defending Olympic Champion, with the always strong Hungarians back. The first round groups were won by Italy, Hungary, Yugoslavia, and Belgium. The Netherlands placed second to Yugoslavia in Group C, and would be eliminated in the semi-finals, eventually placing fifth. But it was controversial. In the semis, the Dutch team defeated the Yugoslavs, 3-2. However, Yugoslavia protested some referee’s decisions and the match was replayed, with Yugoslavia winning that match, 2-1, eliminating the Netherlands.
This original match was set up for a problem from the start. The referee was Belgian Fons Delahaye, a veteran who had officiated at the 1928 Olympics. Before the match Yugoslavia requested of FINA that he be removed, concerned that he would be biased towards the Dutch, but this was not done. After the Yugoslav protest the issue was heard by the FINA Water Polo Board, led by Dutchman Jans de Vries, who abstained from the meeting because it involved the Netherlands. The Board recommended to the Jury d’Appèl that the protest be denied, but the Jury d’Appèl decided otherwise and upheld the protest, requiring the match to be played again with another referee. The Dutch team considered withdrawing and returning home, but eventually elected to stay and play.
The final round came down to Hungary, Yugoslavia, Italy, and the United States. Hungary and Yugoslavia won both their matches in the round, and their semi-final tie was carried over, giving them identical final round records of 2 wins and 1 tie. But Hungary won the gold medal on goal differential, Yugoslavia taking silver. This would be the first of many Olympics in which Hungary and Yugoslavia would prove to be the two strongest teams in the world. They repeated their 1-2 finish in 1956, with Hungary winning medals through 1980, in a stretch of winning water polo medals at 12 consecutive Olympics, and Yugoslavia winning Olympic medals in 1964, 1968, 1980, 1984, and 1988, with gold medals in 1968, 1984, and 1988.

France, represented in part by Barathay, was the 1993 World Champion and 1994 bronze medalist. Norway was the 1994 World Champion and 1993 runner-up and, with its Olympic duo, the 1995 bronze medalist, while Undset was also an Olympic silver medalist from the 1992 quadruple sculls. Germany had been runner-up at the last two editions of the World Championships and a bronze medalist in 1993. The lone exception to the dominance of these three nations was Denmark, who won the 1995 World Championships with Lars Christensen and Martin Haldbo Hansen. Australia, meanwhile, sent one of its defending Olympic champions, Peter Antonie, to Atlanta with a new partner, Jason Day. Antoine was also one half of the winning crew at the 1995 Double Challenge Sculls at the Henley Royal Regatta. Hungary’s Zsolt Dani and Gábor Mitring were the 1994 winners of that tournament.
In the opening round, Norway posted the fastest time by nearly five seconds, while the other heats were won by Denmark and the Italian duo of Davide Tizzano and Agostino Abbagnale, both of whom were Olympic champions in the quadruple sculls from 1988. The Hungarians, meanwhile, were eliminated in the repêchage. In the semi-finals it was France who eliminated the Australians with the fastest time in the round, nearly three seconds ahead of its closest competition, while Italy won the other heat. The race in the final was closer, but Italy, Norway, and France were all ahead of the pack and crossed the finish line in that order. Denmark, the reigning World Champions, came in fourth nearly five seconds later.

He went to the Georgia World Congress Center for the weigh-in only to find that it was being held at the Olympic Village. Although he tried to get back to the Village, he was late for the weigh-in and was disqualified. It was a silly ruling as heavyweights are allowed unlimited weight. Douillet and Ogawa met in the Pool A final, with Douillet winning a close match only by shido. The final against Spain’s Ernesto Pérez was much easier, with Douillet using uchi-mata to win by ippon in 2:03. Douillet would win his fourth World Championship in the heavyweight class in 1997.

In the Olympic final, Harlow Rothert led in the first two rounds, with of 15.670 (51-5) and 15.675 (51-5¼). Sexton took the lead in round three with 15.77 (51-9) and he improved in the final round to the winning mark of 16.005 (52-6 3/16). A few weeks later Sexton broke the world record with 16.16 (53-0¼), but in September 1932, František Douda, the bronze medalist, broke that record with 16.20 (53-1¾).
The results in the 1932 Official Report for places 7-14 are almost certainly wrong. Only final results are given in that book, with no series listed. The only 1932 source that gives a complete series for the shot put is the Finnish report, Olympialaiskisat Los Angelesissa 1932. It lists the results as we have given here, several of which are confirmed by several other 1932 newspaper reports, mainly concerning the Finnish putter, Kalle Järvinen. It appears that whoever transcribed the official results for the 1932 Official Report transposed the marks in the third round (for places 7-14 at least) into the column for the final results. The 1932 Official Report lists places 7-14 (in Imperial measure) as follows:  7) József Darányi (HUN) 48-1½ (14.67); 8) Jules Noël (FRA) 47-8 (14.53); 9) Zygmunt Heljasz (POL) 47-6⅜ (14.49); 10) Harry Hart (RSA) 46-7⅝ (14.22); 11) Clement Duhour (FRA) 45-9½ (13.96); 12) Kalle Järvinen (FIN) 45-7½ (13.91); 13) Paul Winter (FRA) 43-1¼ (13.14); 14) Pedro Elsa (ARG) 36-9¼ (11.21).
There are multiple other contemporary sources from 1932 with slightly differing results. We think the following is the best estimate of the final results but, suffice to say, it  should not be assumed that they are 100% accurate. Notably, there is an Austrian report that Emil Janausch did compete but did not advance from the qualifying round. There are also Brazilian reports that their athlete, Antônio Lira, did record a mark, 12.96, however, that report was only published three months after the Games ended.

Following her retirement, compatriot Ding Ning entered the tournament as the number one seed and the reigning World Champion in the singles and team events. Close behind at number two was Li Xiaoxia, also of China, who had numerous World Championship titles in team and doubles competitions. No other player came close to their dominance, and thus the Chinese were expected to take the top two podium spots and, as Li had a losing record against Ding, Ding came to London as the favorite to win the gold. With China having captured all three medals in the men’s and women’s event at the last Olympics, the International Table Tennis Federation instituted a two entrant per country rule at the tournament, leaving Kim Gyeong-A of South Korea as the number three seed. This would be Kim’s third Olympics: she won bronze in the singles event in 2004 and again in the team event in 2008. The restriction on national entries was not unprecedented, as it had been undertaken in swimming during the 1970s, due to American and East German dominance.
Throughout the tournament Ding seemed to be the stronger player, surrendering only one set out of thirteen through the quarterfinals. Li stumbled at times, but still easily survived to the semi-finals, where she defeated fourth-ranked Kasumi Ishikawa of Japan in five sets. Ding had slightly more trouble overcoming her opponent, Feng Tian Wei of Singapore, but eventually emerged victorious and paved the way for an all-China final. Li displayed an iron determination to defeat her teammate, winning the first two sets 11-8 and 14-12. She then seemed to wear down in the third set, losing 8-11, but picked up again in the fourth with an 11-6 victory. By the fifth set, Li’s momentum was unstoppable and she launched an aggressive barrage against which Ding had no answer. Li won this final set by the widest margin yet, 11-4, and stole the Olympic crown from the favorite. Meanwhile the Chinese-born Feng defeated her Japanese opponent to win the bronze medal, leading China to sweep the podium, at least in spirit, once more.

Italy placed fifth while the Netherlands was well-beaten in 11th.

Her biggest competition was expected to come from Belarussian Nadezhda Ostapchuk, the 2005 World Champion and bronze medalist at the 2008 Olympics. Both qualified easily, with Ostapchuk posting 20.76, the longest ever qualifying mark.
Adams took the lead in the first round of the final with 20.61, Ostapchuk posting only 20.01. But in round two Ostapchuk improved to 21.31, and Adams could never match that, her best mark being 20.70 in round three. Ostapchuk would post four throws over 21 metres, with a best of 21.36 in round three, and seemingly won the gold medal. Behind the two favorites, Russian Yevgeniya Kolodko was in fifth place entering the final round, but came through with 20.48 for what seemed to be a bronze medal, edging out Chinese putter Gong Lijiao.
One week later all the results changed. Ostapchuk had tested positive for the steroid metenolone the day before and the day after the final, and she was disqualified. This gave Adams her second consecutive gold medal, and temporarily moved Kolodko up to silver, moving Gong up to a bronze medal. Adams became only the second woman to win two Olympic shot golds, after Soviet Tamara Press in 1960-64.
That was not the end of the results shuffle in this event. In 2015, the IOC began re-testing samples from the 2008 Beijing and 2012 London Olympics, using newer, more advanced testing techniques, in an effort to find those who had used performance enhancing drugs (PEDs), but in whom it could not be detected at the time of those Olympics. This was one of the many events affected.
In August 2016 Yevgeniya Kolodko was disqualified for a re-test positive for turinabol (dehydrochloromethyltestosterone) and ipamorelin, and lost the silver medal to which she had been re-assigned. The silver and bronze medals were eventually given to the Chinese athletes Gong Lijiao and Li Ling, respectively. In January 2017 Ostapchuk also lost her bronze medal from the 2008 Beijing Olympics, after testing positive for turinabol (dehydrochloromethyltestosterone) and tamoxifen.

(32° C.) day.  In addition it was run over dusty country roads, and the lead automobiles kicked up so much dust that the runners practically choked on it throughout the race.  There was also only one water stop on the course, that being a well at 12 miles.
Among the Americans there were several top distance runners.  Sammy Mellor, winner of the 1902 Boston Marathon; John Lordon, winner of Boston in 1903, Mike Spring, winner of Boston in 1904, and Arthur Newton, who had finished fifth at Paris in the 1900 Olympic marathon.  The top foreign distance runners were not present, but a 5-foot tall Cuban named Félix Carvajal had come to St. Louis.
Carvajal had raised money for the trip by staging exhibitions and running the entire length of Cuba.  Arriving in New Orleans, he lost all his money in a crap game, which forced him to hitch-hike to St. Louis.  He showed up on race day wearing heavy street shoes, long trousers, a beret and a long-sleeved shirt.  Martin Sheridan helped him out by trimming the pants and the shirt.  During the race, Carvajal would stop to eat some green apples and which caused stomach cramps and didn’t help his cause any.  Still he finished fourth, listed in a 1905 edition of the St. Louis Republic as “about 1/2-hour behind Hicks.”
The first two South African Olympians were, ironically, black men named Len Taunyane and Jan Mashiani who ran the marathon.  Both Tswana Tribesmen, they were present at the South African exhibit of the Louisiana Purchase Exposition.  They had been dispatch runners during the recent Boer War and were noted to be “the fleetest in the service.”  They finished the marathon in 9th and 12th place, respectively.
The race started at 3 PM and the runners ran five laps of the stadium before heading out into the country.  Fred Lorz had the early lead, but dropped out at nine miles.  At that point, the lead was held by Arthur Newton, veteran of the 1900 Olympic marathon, and Sammy Mellor.  Shortly thereafter, Mellor slowed to a walk, and Tom Hicks moved up on the leaders.  Through 14 miles, Mellor had regained the lead, with Newton second, Hicks thirds, and Albert Coray and William Garcia together in fourth.  Garcia would eventually drop out, and suffered so badly from the heat, dust, and lack of water, that he spent several days in the hospital, his life in the balance, before recovering.
At this point, Hicks began to flag badly.  His handlers helped him, administering strychnine sulfate in an egg white, giving him water, and sponging him down.  The early sports medicine seemed to work as he had the lead at 19 miles.  At 20 miles he was again ready to collapse when he was given the same potions along with sips of brandy.  He was then passed by Fred Lorz, who was refreshed after having ridden in an automobile most of the race.
Lorz entered the stadium first and received the crowd’s plaudits, as they were oblivious to his scheme.  Hicks came shortly after, almost dead on his feet.  He had finished the race by slow jogging interspersed with periods of walking.  Lorz was soon found out and was banned from amateur competition for life, only to see it rescinded in time for him to win the 1905 Boston Marathon.

The team all-around was contested first, with the top 36 finishers from that event advancing to the individual all-around final. However, to prevent individual nations from dominating with over-representation, no more than three gymnasts from any one country could advance to the individual final. The total score consisted of 50% of the team all-around score and the performances on all six apparatuses in the individual final. Soviet Nikolay Andrianov was the defending champion and had won the 1978 World Championships, but in 1979, his teammate, Aleksandr Dityatin won the Worlds, followed by American Kurt Thomas. Thomas could not compete, done in by Jimmy Carter and the American-led boycott. In his absence this event came down to a battle between Dityatin and Andrianov, with Dityatin winning gold and Andrianov close behind for silver, the bronze going to Bulgarian Stoyan Delchev. Delchev’s medal was the first by a Bulgarian gymnast at the Olympics since a bronze by Velik Kapsazov on rings in 1960.
Dityatin would go on to win eight medals in Moskva, breaking the record for the most medals at a single Olympics, previously seven held by seven Olympians. Eight remains the record through 2012, having been tied by Michael Phelps in 2004 and 2008. Andrianov had won seven medals in 1976, and would add five in 1980, ending his Olympic career with 15 medals, a record for men at the Olympics until broken by Phelps in 2008.

Hermanni was nowhere near his level but was still expected to win and he did not disappoint, winning his first three matches by falls, and decisioning Greece’s Ioannis Farmakidis in the medal round to secure the gold medal. He would win a bronze medal in freestyle lightweight in 1936. The bronze medal in Los Angeles went to Sweden’s Einar Karlsson, who came back in Berlin and won another silver medal, that time in Greco-Roman featherweight.

The runners made four circuits of the 500 metre track before making out for the streets of Paris, although Johan Nyström withdrew before one lap of the stadium.
George Touquet-Daunis led the runners out of the Bois de Boulogne.  Race descriptions are scanty, but he led through at least half the race, followed by Ernst Fast.  When Touquet-Daunis dropped out, Fast took the lead.  However, he was basically spent by that point, and Michel Théato passed him to win by a few minutes over Émile Champion, with Fast finishing almost 40 minutes back.
Théato was a baker’s assistant and knew the streets of Paris well from his deliveries.  Arthur Newton later claimed that Théato and Champion must have used their knowledge of the streets to cheat as he never saw them pass him.  However, this does not explain Fast’s finish, nor does it agree with race reports which have Touquet-Daunis and Fast leading the early part of the race.  In the early 1990s, French athletics historian Alain Bouillé discovered that Théato was actually a Luxembourgeois national.

Their two best 400 metre runners over the last few years had been Jeremy Wariner (2004 Olympic gold medalist and 2005/07 World Champion) and LaShawn Merritt (2008 Olympic gold medalist and 2009 World Champion). But Wariner had not made the US Olympic team, and Merritt withdrew in the first round of the 400 with an injury was not available. The US 4x400 relay team in London was a patchwork of their back-up runners and some 400 hurdlers, notably Angelo Taylor.
It was not enough. The Bahamas started off with their two best runners, leading off with Chris Brown and Demetrius Pinder, hoping to take the lead and hold on. Brown took the lead on the opener with his 44.8, leading Trinidad & Tobago with the USA third. Pinder opened the lead further with a 43.6 second leg. On the third leg, American Tony McQuay ran the fastest split of the race, recording 43.41, giving the Americans the lead at the final exchange, as he handed the baton to Taylor. Bahamian Ramon Miller pulled up to Taylor’s shoulder at the head of the stretch, and with 50 metres left, he moved into the lead and Taylor could not match him, as the Bahamas won the gold medal, with the United States second. Trinidad & Tobago filled out the podium.
The United States was fortunate to even make the final. In the heats, Manteo Mitchell led off for the Americans and felt a pop in his leg halfway through his leg. It would turn out to be a broken fibula, but he struggled on and finished his lap in 45.9, and the last three runners brought the US home in second in the heat to qualify. In the other heat, South Africa did not finish when they were bumped by Kenyan runners at the first exchange.

Finland’s Thorvald Strömberg, meanwhile, was the current World runner-up. Fredriksson came in third in his heat in the opening round, behind Strömberg and Lev Nikitin of the Soviet Union, while the other heats were won by Rik Verbrugghe of Belgium and Wim van der Kroft of the Netherlands, the latter of whom was a bronze medalist from the 1936 Olympic K-2 1000. In the final, Fredriksson took command of the race at the halfway point and never relented, winning the gold medal and leaving silver for Strömberg, a reversal of their fortunes from the previous day’s K-1 10000.

After having finished fourth at the 2008 Summer Games, missing out on bronze by nine seconds, she improved significantly and went on to win the 2010 World Cup and the 2011 World Championships. Going into the London Olympics ranked #1, she won the test event on the course, sealing her reputation as the favorite. In a sport as unpredictable as mountain biking, however, she would certainly not go unchallenged. Sabine Spitz of Germany, the defending Olympic champion and World Champion in 2003, was forty years old but had not slowed down and was well-prepared to defend her Olympic title. Poland’s Maja Włoszczowska, the 2010 World Champion and a silver medalist at both the 2008 Summer Olympics and the 2011 World Championships, was not competing due to injury but Beijing’s Olympic bronze medalist and two-time World Champion Irina Kalentyeva of Russia was expected to mount a challenge to Pendrel as well. Finally there was hometown favorite Annie Last who, although never finishing better than eighth at a major international competition, had spent two years training as a senior rather than in the under-23 division in the hopes of being selected for the 2012 Summer Olympics. With the support of the sold-out, 20,000 strong crowd at the event, she could certainly not be counted out.
After the start Pendrel, Last, and Spitz helped form a four rider-strong lead group that included Julie Bresset of France, the most recent under-23 World Champion. These cyclists put some distance between themselves and the field behind in the beginning, but Pendrel and Last began to fade by the second lap and were eventually passed by American Georgia Gould, who came from around 16th position to 7th by the end of the first lap. Following a collision between Pendrel and Last, Bresset, Spitz, and Gould led the field and were never challenged. Bresset was usually in front of the trio, with Spitz and Gould exchanging podium positions until Spitz crashed on a technical section approximately halfway through the race, which forced Gould to stop. Bresset used the opportunity to break away and was all but assured the gold medal, which she claimed over a minute ahead of anyone else. Spitz and Gould were still far ahead of their closest competitors and, while Gould’s early charge from 16th to podium position eventually cost her energy, Spitz was able to use her experience to outmanoeuver her opponent and win silver a comfortable six seconds ahead of her American rival. Gould finished with the bronze medal, a respectable 33 seconds ahead of Kalentieva, who was fourth. Last and Pendrel faded to eighth and ninth respectively, certainly a disappointing finish for the overwhelming favorite in the race. Pendrel would, however, go on to win bronze in the event at the 2016 Summer Olympics.

By the end of the competition he had finished in first or second on four of the six apparatuses with a string of consistently strong performances that reminded the audience why he was three-time World, and now Olympic, Champion.

If there was any other contender for the crown, it was Germany’s Maximilian Levy, the 2009 World Champion and runner-up at the most recent edition.
Both riders easily won their heats in the first two rounds of competition, setting the stage for an edge-of-the-seat final match. In the final, Mohd Azizulhasni Awang of Malaysia made an early attack once the pacesetter left the track, but he was quickly overtaken by Hoy, who wasted no time bolting out to the front and giving it everything he had.

Ties broken by lightest bodyweight.,na,"Just a few hours after the women’s heavyweight competition, the final women’s weightlifting event in Tokyo was contested and was the super-heavyweight class for lifters with a bodyweight of more than 87 kg.
The clear favourite was Li Wenwen, the reigning world champion from 2019 and back-to-back winner of the last two Asian championships in 2019 and 2020 (held in 2021). At the last Asian championships four months before the Olympics, she set world records in snatch (148 kg), clean & jerk (187 kg), and total (335 kg). The only other athlete to set a world record in this class was Tatyana Kashirina, but she was suspended after anti-doping investigations in December 2020. The best qualifiers were Sarah Robles, qualification best 290 kg, Laurel Hubbard, qualification best 285 kg, Verónica Saladín, qualification best 283 kg, Lee Seon-Mi, qualification best 280 kg, and Emily Campbell, season best 276 kg. Not present was Son Yeong-Hui, the silver medallist at the last Asian championships with 279 kg.
A controversy was the participation of Hubbard who was the first ever openly transgender athlete competing at the Olympics. She lived as a man until 2012 when she underwent a gender reassignment surgery; still it was argued that she was born in a men’s body and went through male puberty, but she fulfilled all requirements including a low testosterone level. The IOC had already allowed transgender athletes at the Olympics since 2004, but Hubbard was the first to compete, which was seen as an important step for more inclusion at the Games not only by the LGBT community.
The competition was easily won by Li who started her snatch, as well as her clean & jerk, after all other athletes had already finished their lifts. She enjoyed a perfect competition as she cleared all six attempts, finishing with a total of 320 kg and a winning margin of 37 kg. The battle for the other medals was closer as Robles lifted 128 kg, Lee 125 kg, and Campbell 122 kg in snatch, while Hubbard failed to give a valid lift. In clean & jerk, Lee started with 148 kg while Robles and Campbell lifted 150 kg each. Lee went on to 152 kg, which was answered with a 154 kg by Robles, and when Lee missed 155 kg, and Campbell cleared 156 kg, the Korean was out of the medals. Robles was not able to improve, but Campbell also cleared another personal best with 161 kg to secure silver.
The Olympic Standard for Olympic records was 139 kg for snatch, 172 kg for clean & jerk, and 306 kg for total. All records were broken by Li who managed to lift 140 kg in snatch, and 173 and 180 kg in clean & jerk, for totals of 313 and 320 kg. After Li Fabin and Chen Lijun both won weightlifting gold for China on the same day earlier in this Games, Wang Zhouyu and Li did the same for their native country for a total of seven weightlifting gold medal for China at these Games, a mark only once achieved previously by the Soviet Union in 1976.
Despite failing to show a valid lift, Hubbard became the oldest female weightlifter ever to compete at the Olympics aged 43 years 174 days, surpassing Maria Elisabete Jorge who was only 24 days younger when she participated back in 2000. Overall, Hubbard was the third oldest weightlifting competitor ever, male or female, with only Josef Schuster and Adelfino Mancinelli, who both competed in 1952, being older. Kuinini Manumua was the first ever female weightlifter from Tonga to compete at the Olympics and finished eighth. Tenth place finisher Sarah Fischer was the first ever female lifter from Austria at the Olympics.

But she had never won a major international in the long jump. Back was perennial favorite Heike Drechsler, gold medalist from Barcelona and winner of the last four European Championships. Italy’s Fiona May was also a threat but she had a habit of finishing second in major championships – 1996 Olympics, 1999 Worlds, 1998 Europeans, although she had been World Champion in 1995. Drechsler, May and Jones decided the medals, in that order, in round three, as they all produced their best efforts in that round. May and Jones tied with 6.92 (22-8½) and it fell to the countback with May winning with a best second mark of 6.82 (22-4½) produced in round two. Jones had only one other legal mark.
But the results of this event and every 2000 event in which Marion Jones competed are not what they seem. Dogged by rumors of drug use, Jones was married to shot putter C. J. Hunter and during the Sydney Olympics it was revealed that he tested positive for steroids several times earlier in the year. They later divorced, and she then married sprinter Tim Montgomery. In 2003 he was found to have participated with the BALCO Scandal and was banned for two years by the IAAF. In 2006 Jones almost tested positive for the only time in her career, with a sample showing use of eryrthropoietin (EPO) after the US Championships. But her B sample was negative and it was not considered a positive drug test. Shortly thereafter Montgomery was charged in a check-kiting scheme and Jones was implicated as well, and they later divorced. She then married Barbadian sprinter Obadele Thompson, who had, at least, no drug charges against him. In October 2007, Jones admitted to federal prosecutors that she had lied to them and had used steroids in the months prior to the Sydney Olympics. Her 2000 results were stricken by the IAAF and the medals were returned to the IOC.

Olsen returned to the Olympics in 1924 at Paris and added three more medals, including one gold.
We do not have complete results for this event, nor all final placements. We have used multiple sources, including USA, Swedish, Danish, Swiss, and French sources. However, in Finnish sources there is some controversy about the placement of Vilho Vauhkonen. He shot 59 in the event and was to be in a shoot-off for the 2nd-5th places. Finnish sources state that Olsen, Kuchen, and Paroche engaged in the shoot-off but Vauhkonen initially did not. A Finnish official then noted that he had shot 59 and should have been in the shoot-off. Vauhkonen shot a round, scoring 58, which should have tied him with Léon Johnson.
Per the Finnish sources, another shoot-off was ordered between Vauhkonen and Johnson, but Johnson refused to take part, apparently feeling that Vauhkonen had not participated in the original shoot-off. Vauhkonen shot another round, scoring 51.
Vesa Tikander, director of the Finnish Sports Museum, notes, “The Finnish shooting team left Antwerp believing that Vauhkonen had earned a silver medal, bronze [at] the very least. However, no medal for the individual event was sent to Finland. Ernst Krogius, the Finnish IOC member, promised to investigate. On 15 December 1920 the Finnish daily Uusi Suomi published an interview in which Krogius announced that Vauhkonen’s shoot-off result of 58 points had now been recognized and that the Finnish shooter had been awarded third place in the individual competition. Interestingly, Kalle Virtapohja, a Finnish shooting historian, has found that according to the records of the Finnish Shooting Association, Vilho Vauhkonen received his individual Olympic bronze medal in a ceremony held at the annual assembly of the association on 3 June 1921. However, there is no physical proof of this: Vauhkonen’s family has no recollection of such a medal.”
As noted we have examined multiple other sources from other countries. All of these sources that list a fourth- and fifth-place finisher have Vauhkonen in fourth and Paroche in fifth. The shoot-off score of 56 for Vauhkonen was given by Swedish sources, per the late Swedish Olympic historian Ture Widlund.

Meanwhile, title favorites Kharchenko and Prock, the reigning World Champion, were further back in the field. Müller then consolidated his lead on Hackl, always finishing ahead of his closest rival and winning three out of four runs. Behind Müller, the race was quite close. Hackl’s third run was rather poor, and he’d dropped to fourth place. But in the final descent, he edged out both Kharchenko and Thomas Jacob (GDR) to win the Olympic silver – his first but certainly not his last Olympic medal.

This was noticeable in the men’s C-2 500, as nations that had won two of the last edition’s medals and six of the last nine World Championship medals were absent. The favorites were the 1981 and 1983 World Champions Matija Ljubek and Mirko Nišović of Yugoslavia and they made short work of the competition in Los Angeles, winning their opening heat by a margin of almost a second and the final by just over two. The Romanian duo of Toma Simionov and Ivan Patzaichin, who had numerous Olympic and World Champion medals between them, took silver, but the tables would be turned the following day when Ljubek and Nišović were runners-up to the Romanians in the C-2 1000. The battle for bronze was much more exciting, with France’s Didier Hoyer and Éric Renaud going neck and neck with Spain’s Enrique Míguez and Narciso Suárez across the finish line, with the latter capturing bronze by the slimmest margin possible: 0.01 seconds. Again, however, the situation would be more or less reversed in the C-2 1000, when France earned bronze and Spain was sixth.

In fact, the two nations had never played each other, the British fearing embarrassment as their (former) colony was considered the better team. There was no question the UK would again be absent at their home Olympics, although there were some organizational difficulties. First of all, the four British nations were independently affiliated with the international federation FIH and weren’t very keen on cooperating. Also, there were no hockey grounds to train on, as these were used by cricketers during the summer. Still, they managed to put together a team, the first real British hockey team at the Olympics (the 1908 and 1920 champions had been composed entirely of English players). Their captain was the versatile Norman Borrett, a first class cricketer and national squash champion who once qualified for Wimbledon but didn’t have time to compete.
Britain and India were seeded, along with Pakistan and the Netherlands. Pakistan had only separated from India the previous year, and made their first Olympic appearance in London. One of the team members, Ali Dara, had been on the golden Indian team of 1936. All four ranked teams made the semis, although the Brits were held to a goalless draw by Switzerland, and Pakistan crushed the Dutch 6-1 in their group match. The semi-finals were close, and British observers considered the Indians to be lucky to get away with a 2-1 win against the Dutch. With Britain beating Pakistan, the gold medal match would finally see India play the Britons. Completely focused on its defence, Britain was unable to keep up with the fast-paced Indians, and they lost it 4-0. The bronze went to the Netherlands, beating Pakistan 4-1 in a replay of the first 3rd place match, which had ended in a draw.

As the 1991-92 season started the Olympic gold looked to be a battle between him and Norway’s Fred Børre Lundberg, who had won the 1991 World Championships and led the 1990-91 World Cup season. No one was considering a French skier named Fabrice Guy, but when he won four the five World Cup events in 1991-92, he became a favorite, and would be helped by the hometown crowd. Guy was at his best in the ski race, and hoped to place high enough on the jumping hill to be in contention. But he did better than that. The jumping was won by Austria’s Klaus Ofner with 228.5 points, who had been third at the 1991 World Championships, but Guy placed third, with 222.1, giving him a starting deficit of only 42.7 seconds. But more importantly, he beat Sulzenbacher, who usually was at his best on the hill, but in Albertville posted 221.6 to start 3.3 seconds behind Guy. And Lundberg was even further back, starting 1:08.0 behind Guy.
In the ski race, Ofner was off first, but it was not his strength and he would finish only 21st in the skiing and fifth overall. Guy pulled away from Sulzenbacher in the first 5 km, and neither was ever challenged by Lundberg, as Guy skied to the gold medal. Sulzenbacher won the bronze, surprisingly outskied by Guy’s teammate, Sylvain Guillaume, who was third in the skiing and won the silver medal. Guillaume would not be heard of again at major internationals, while Guy would place third at the 1997 World Championships, and won the 1991-92 seasonal World Cup. Lundberg improved in the cross-country to finish fourth overall, but would come back to win the gold medal in Lillehammer.

The top six overall in qualifying advanced to the final, as did the top 12 with each implement. Thus the final consisted of 12 gymnasts with each implement (ball, club, hoop, ribbon), and 17 overall, but only eight of the finalists competed with all four implements. Thus only they could win the all-around title. The favorite was Ukrainian Oleksandra Timoshenko, the 1989 World Champion and runner-up in 1991 to her countrywoman, Oksana Skaldina. Timoshenko performed well and won quite easily over Spain’s Carolina Pascual, who had little international reputation. Skaldina refused to acknowledge Pascual on the medal podium, feeling that she deserved the silver medal and that Pascual had only defeated her because the competition was in Spain. Skaldina was fortunate to be competing as she had placed only fifth at the 1992 European Championships, and it was not certain she would be on the team. That event was won by Maria Petrova (BUL), who placed fifth in Barcelona.  The 1992 World Championships were held in November and won by young Russian Oksana Kostina, who was killed in a car accident in February 1993.

Ties broken by lightest bodyweight.,na,"Based on his 345 kg total at the most recent Chinese National Championships, Lin Qingfeng was considered the favorite to win gold in the men’s lightweight weightlifting division at the 2012 Summer Olympics. He would face significant competition, however, from Mete Binay, the 2010 World Champion from Turkey, Əfqan Bayramov of Azerbaijan, the reigning European Champion, and Arakel Mirzoyan of Armenia, 2009 European Champion and 2009 world runner-up. The B group, which usually consisted of weightlifters outside of the world’s top ten, set an unusually high bar for the event. Junior Sánchez of Venezuela, the 2011 Pan American Games silver medalist, lifted 148 kg in the snatch, a mark that was bested by only three competitors in the A pool. Kim Myong-Hyok of North Korea’s lift of 184 kg in the clean and jerk was even more impressive, bested by only two participants from the favored group and leaving him in first place at the end of the round.
Lin won the snatch portion of the competition with a lift of 157 kg, five kilograms more than his nearest competitor, Răzvan Martin of Romania, who had been runner-up at the last two European Championships. Binay came in third with a 150 kg lift, while Bayramov was eliminated after failing to lift 142 kg in three attempts. Martin became the first person to surpass Kim and Sánchez in total points by lifting 177 kg in his first attempt at the clean and jerk. Binay attempted to be the next by lifting 180 kg, but failed on both attempts and was left out of the running for a medal, while Martin successfully lifted the weight and increased his lead by 3 kilograms. Lin then succeeded in his attempt at 182 kg, placing him well above Martin thanks to his impressive snatch performance. With no realistic hope of surpassing Lin, Martin attempted a 182 kg lift that failed, while Lin extended his lead with a successful try at 187 kg. In between Indonesia’s Triyatno, twice World Championship bronze medalist (2009 and 2010) and third-place finisher at the 2008 Olympic Games, lifted 186 kg to guarantee himself a podium spot. Triyatno seemed to have reached his limit at that point, but managed the best lift of the tournament with 188 kg to pass Martin and take the silver medal. For his final lift, Lin attempted to break the world record with 198 kg and, although he was not successful, he certainly went home a champion.
Those results stood until November 2020, after re-testing of samples from London. Romania’s Răzvan Martin’s samples produced an anti-doping rule violation (ADRV) and he was disqualified, removing his bronze medal. At the end of 2020, no adjustments have been made in the medal standings for this event. In June 2021, by decision of the IOC Executive Board, Kim Myong-Hyok was advanced to the bronze medal position.

Three of the team’s four runners had won the European title in 1946, and the same trio had already set a World Record in the 4×200 metres. Set during German occupation, the record had been a minor act of resistance, running in Dutch outfits and taking the record from the Germans. Briefly before London, the Dutch squad also broke the world record in the 4×110 yards relay.
But shortly before the start of the heats, the Dutch team panicked: they were missing their anchor runner. Fanny Blankers-Koen had gone shopping and only returned just in time with a brand new raincoat. In spite of this scare, they set the fastest time and qualified for the next round. The field was close up until the third exchange, with only Australia leading clearly. But Blankers-Koen caught up with Australian anchor Joyce King in time to cross the line first.
Upon return to Amsterdam, Blankers-Koen (and the rest of the Dutch team), was received by a large crowd. She received praise and and gifts from various people. Her neighbors had decided to buy her a new bicycle, so “she could stop running” and “go through life at a slower pace”. But she did not take the advice to heart, continuing to compete thru the 1952 Olympics.

China’s team of Xu Dongxiang, a 2006 World Champion and twice Olympic finalist, and rookie Huang Wenyi had shown promise during the most recent World Cup, a tournament that saw New Zealand’s Louise Ayling and Julia Edward take home gold and set a world record time. Canada had won the 2010 World Championship and, although only Lindsay Jennerich remained from that duo, she had still captured silver at the 2011 edition with her new partner Patricia Obee. The Netherlands was the defending Olympic champion, but its lineup had changed since the 2008 Games and the nation had not been a factor at the World Championships since.
In the heats, however, a major surprise for Britain came when its duo, Katherine Copeland and Sophie Hosking, posted the fastest time by nearly seven seconds. Hosking was a veteran, having won four World Championship medals, including bronze in the lightweight double sculls in 2011, but Copeland was a new partner and a rookie on the senior international scene. The semi-finals proved that this was not a fluke, as they once again took the top time by over three seconds. In the final Greece pushed out to an early lead, which they held until the halfway point, but the Britons fought them the entire way and, by the 1500m mark, had placed themselves in a position where they would be nearly uncatchable. Copeland and Hosking won British women’s rowing third gold medal of the 2012 Games – and ever – while the Greeks had to settle for a bronze medal after being edged out by China for silver at the line.

Among the favorites were the Swiss defending champion Dario Cologna, and Norway’s rising star Johannes Høsflot Klæbo. The 2017 world champion, and Tour de Ski winner Sergey Ustyugov, was not allowed to compete by the IOC, due to the finding of the McLaren-Report. In the 2017-18 season, only one men’s skiathlon was contested, at Lillehammer in December 2017 with four Norwegians finishing in the first four: Klæbo first, then triple World Cup winner Martin Johnsrud Sundby, followed by Hans Christer Holund and Simen Hegstad Krüger. Krüger was a relative newcomer, having won his first World Cup race in December 2017, over 15 km freestyle.
In PyeongChang, nobody dared to break away from a large leading group for the first 25 km, with the favorites still cautious, and pace moderate. Krüger, less fancied than his compatriots, was involved in a fall, along with two OAR athletes, just a few hundred metres from the start. But with less than 5 km from the finish line, he got into a position where he was in with a chance to escape the pack, and he took it, and within just one kilometer, Krüger opened a gap of 22 seconds. The pursuers hesitated for too long as it was not until about 27 km that Sundby started the pursuit , with Holund close behind. But Krüger held on to his lead to become a surprise winner with Sundby second, just eight seconds behind and Holund in third, another two seconds adrift. Most of the favorites finished among the top ten: Maurice Manificat from France was fifth, Cologna sixth, Canadian Alex Harvey eighth, and Klæbo tenth.
With a clean sweep in the first men’s event, the Norwegians gave an indication of their superiority in the men’s cross-country in PyeongChang. Like other races in the first few days of the Games, it was characterized by ice cold weather of minus 13° C and stormy gusts of wind.

D’Inzeo had 12 faults in the second round but it was good enough to bring him the gold medal, leading his brother, Piero D’Inzeo, who had 8 faults in both rounds and took the silver medal. Britain’s David Broome won the bronze medal with 23 faults, and he would be voted Britain’s Sports Personality of the Year for 1960.

It was simply not an event at which that nation had produced any major throwers. But earlier in the year 19-year-old Keshorn Walcott had won the Central American & Caribbean Championships, throwing a world-class 82.83. Two weeks later he surprised again by winning the 2012 World Junior title. Prior to 2012, his PR had been only 75.77.
But he was not considered one of the medal favorites in London, and as Bob Hersh wrote in Track & Field News, “Nor should he have been.” The qualifying was led by the favorite, Czech Vítězslav Veselý, with the two-time defending champion, Norwegian Andreas Thorkildsen, qualifying comfortably, along with former World Champion Tero Pitkämäki of Finland.
In the final Walcott opened with 83.51 which led after the first round, nobody else surpassing 80 metres. He improved that in round two with 84.58 to continue in the lead, although Pitkämäki moved into second with 82.68 and Thorkildsen moved into third with 82.63, as Veselý struggled back in fifth with 81.69. The third round saw another surprise as Ukrainian Oleksandr P’iatnytsia moved into second with 84.51. And that settled the gold and silver medals, as nobody would surpass Walcott nor P’iatnytsia’s marks. In the final rounds, Finn Antti Ruuskanen threw 84.12 to move onto the podium for bronze. Veselý improved in his final round with 83.34 but it was only good enough for fourth. Thorkildsen saw his attempt to three-peat fail as he finished sixth.
Walcott became only the second Olympic champion from Trinidad & Tobago, after Hasely Crawford, who won the 1976 100 metres. He also became the first person to win an Olympic and World Junior title in the same year in athletics. His victory was also only the second time that the javelin was not won by a European, after Cy Young (USA) had won in 1952. It did not go unrewarded. Prime Minister Kamla Persad-Bissessar announced a national holiday in Trinidad & Tobago. He was given £100,000, a luxury home, 20,000 acres of land, and best of all, a lighthouse.
That was how the event and the results seemed to have ended. In 2015, however, the IOC began re-testing samples from the 2008 Beijing and 2012 London Olympics, using newer, more advanced testing techniques, in an effort to find those who had used performance enhancing drugs (PEDs), but in whom it could not be detected at the time of those Olympics. This was one of the many events affected.
In August 2016 it was revealed that Oleksandr P’iatnytsia of Ukraine, the original silver medalist, was disqualified for a re-test positive for turinabol (dehydrochloromethyltestosterone). Finland’s Antti Ruuskanen was advanced to the silver medal and Czechia’s Vitězslav Veselý was moved up to the bronze medal.

The best American seemed to be Antonio McKay with Alonzo Babers also to be respected. The second semi-final saw Cameron pull up at 150 metres. He hopped for about 20 metres, then began running again, and qualified in 45.10, startling for someone who had basically stopped running midway through. But his leg injury was too severe and he would not start the final. The final was led early by Australia’s Darren Clark and he held it to the final curve. There Babers and Gabriel Tiacoh of the Ivory Coast passed him together. On the homestretch Babers was too strong and pulled away from Tiacoh with McKay closing for the bronze medal, Clark finishing fourth.

Among their challengers would be Anatoly Sass and Aleksandr Timoshinin of the Soviet Union, the nation defending its Olympic title, Bulgaria’s Atanas Zhelev and Yordan Valchev, the most recent European runners-up, and Jaroslav Hellebrand and Petr Krátký of Czechoslovakia, who had won bronze medals at the last two European Championships.
In the opening round it was the Bulgarians who posted the fastest time, but most attention was focused on the Swiss duo, as Studach overexerted himself in Mexico City’s high altitude and collapsed, leading to his hospitalization and replacement by Hans Ruckstuhl. The Swiss, along with Czechoslovakia among others, were subsequently eliminated in the semi-finals. In the final, the relatively unheralded Dutch duo of Leendert van Dis and Harry Droog led the race most of the way, but were passed by Sass and Timoshinin in the last 500 metres and forced to settle for silver.

Then McGregor came on fast, but could not quite catch Schollander, settling for the silver medal.
The bronze medal battle was very close between Hans-Joachim Klein of Germany and America’s Gary Ilman.

One who did not qualify was American Brad Walker, 2007 World Champion and silver medalist in 2005. In the final, only six vaulters could get over 5.70 (18-8¼), but for four of them, they would go no higher. Of those Denys Yurchenko (UKR) won the bronze medal as he cleared 5.70 on one attempt and had only one miss at lower heights. Yurchenko was injured on that clearance and kept passing but never jumped again. That left Russia’s Yevgeny Lukyanenko and Australia’s Steve Hooker to contest the gold and silver medal. Lukyanenko seemed to have the advantage when he made 5.80 (19-0¼) on his first attempt, Hooker needing three tries to go clear. Both cleared 5.85 (19-2¼) on their third attempt.

For the first time the match sprint was conducted as best two of three races in phases besides the final – from the quarter-finals onwards. All the quarter- and semi-finals were decided in two straight races. Harris defeated Australia’s Charles Bazzano in one semi, while Italy’s Mario Ghella swept Denmark’s Axel Schandorff in the other semi. In the second race of his semi, Ghella had shown his potential with an 11.9 finish, the fastest time of any race in London. The final was not close, but it was not what the British expected. In the first race, Ghella rode away to a five-length victory, when Harris made a tactical error leaving room for the Italian to pass on the inside. Harris eased up when he was beaten, saving himself for the next two races. But that would not happen. The second race saw the same result, the younger Italian easily winning by two lengths to take the gold medal. Schandorff won the bronze by defeating Bazzano in two straight races. A few weeks later, Ghella won the World Championship in the sprint, defeating Schandorff in the final, with Harris placing third, defeating his Olympic tandem partner, Alan Bannister. Harris turned professional and won the World Sprint title in 1949, the first time that was ever won by a néo-pro. He would defend that title in 1950 and 1951, and won again in 1954, and would place second in 1956. Amazingly, in 1974, he came out of retirement and won the British sprint championship.

Brendel and Tarnovschi won their preliminaries, allowing them to advance to the final directly, but Fuksa was bested by Brazil’s Isaquias Queiroz, the reigning Pan-American Champion.

Nonetheless, this made him Brazil’s first Olympic canoeing medallist and he would go on to take bronze in the C-1 200 and silver in the C-2 1000 to become the first Brazilian to win three medals in a single Olympics. Over two seconds later, Tarnovschi edged out Shtokalov to capture the final podium spot. Two days later, however, Tarnovschi’s placement was suspended after he failed a doping test - although the IOC later reinstated him pending an International Canoe Federation hearing.

They had only failed to win the 2006 Olympics, when Sven Kramer fell during the semi-finals against the eventual champion, Italy. Following his dramatic loss in the 10,000 m, Kramer was poised to win this race. While he had hoped to have the same team mates as in 2006, Erben Wennemars and Carl Verheijen hadn’t qualified. But with 1,500 m champion Mark Tuitert, sprinter Simon Kuipers and young talent Jan Blokhuijsen, the Dutch still were the team to beat. Other medal contenders were the United States, which had tied for victory in the season’s first World Cup, although as in 2006, 1,000 m champion Shani Davis had elected to focus solely on individual events. Norway had also won a World Cup race, while the Canadians had set up special training program for the event.
It came as no surprise that these four teams then made the semi-finals, although Norway had a lot of difficulty beating the Koreans. The Canadians set the fastest time, and improved on that in the semi-finals, beating the Norwegians. In the other heat, the Americans upset the Dutch, who trailed the inexperienced Americans (save for former Olympic champion Chad Hedrick) for the entire race.
In the North American final, the Canadians took off at a world record pace, quickly leaving the Americans behind. But the hosts tired quickly, and the US slowly crept back. But, to the joy of the crowd, Canada held a gap of two tenths at the line. In the consolation final, the Dutch and the Norwegians both showed they were both capable of more than they had shown in the semi-finals, recording the fastest times. The Dutch even recorded an Olympic record, but it only gave them a bronze medal.

After summer trouble with myocarditis following COVID-19 vaccination, he had struggled in national and international competition, and had missed qualification for the 1,000 m, which he had also won in 2018. He came into the event having beaten Krol both at the Dutch Olympic Trials and at the European Championships in January.
The season’s World Cup races had been won by mass start expert Joey Mantia (twice), Chinese hope Ning Zhongyan and 2018 silver medalist Kim Min-Seok. Of the Dutch duo, Krol had only managed a single third place.
Krol was the first of the favorites to skate, in pair 10. He went all-out and shattered the leading time by Sergey Trofimov by nearly two seconds, finishing in 1:43.55, while his pair mate Peder Kongshaug moved into second with 1:44.39.

His performances earlier in the season had only confirmed this status, winning all four World Cups he contested. But as with many Russians, Yuskov was barred from competing at the 2018 Olympics due to his doping history. As a junior, he had been caught for marijuana usage in 2007, and had served a four-month ban. This left the role of favorite to Dutchman Kjeld Nuis.

Austria was able to hold on to fourth place ahead of Slovenia, but they were 120.1 points behind the winning Norwegian team. By winning the team event, and the women’s normal hill, Norway took their Winter Olympic tally of gold medals to 11, overtaking Finland’s former record of 10.

Little thought was given to America’s best, Laura Wilkinson, who had spent much of early 2000 in a cast, recovering from broken bones in her right foot. In the final, Li led after two dives, with Canada’s Anne Montminy, runner-up at 1998 Worlds, moving up to second place, while Sang dropped back to third. But both Li and Sang botched their third dive, and Wilkinson went into an unlikely lead, marginally ahead of Montminy and Li. Wilkinson again nailed her next-to-last dive but entered the final round only ¼-point ahead of Montminy and a few points in front of Li. All three had successful final dives, but Montminy’s had a DD of only 2.8 and she dropped back to the bronze medal spot, as Wilkinson won a shocking gold medal, with Li taking silver.
Wilkinson dove again on platform at the 2004 and 2008 Olympics, but this would be her only Olympic medal. Montminy’s bronze was added to the silver she had won earlier in Sydney in synchro springboard.

Meagher. Mary T would have been favored to win both butterfly events at Moscow, as the world record holder, but the boycott put paid to those hopes. In 1981 she had won the US Nationals in 57.93, a stunning Beamonesque mark that broke her world record by 1.33 seconds and would last as the world record until 1999. In 1982 she won the World Championships in the 100 fly. Swimming World magazine wrote “From 1979 through 1982, Mary T. Meagher dominated the 100 butterfly probably more than any other swimmer has in any event.” But by 1983 Mary T had grown up, was a college freshman at U Cal Berkeley, gained the requisite freshman-15, did not make the US team for the 1983 Pan Ams, and had only the seventh fastest time in the world that year.
But wanting to prove herself at the Olympics, and to the East Germans, Mary T dropped out of school and moved to Mission Viejo to dedicate herself to Olympic gold. In January 1984 she swam 59.63 at the USS International, her best time since 1982, but she was beaten at the US Trials in June by Jenna Johnson. She and her coach, Mark Schubert, were concerned but he convinced her that she had overtapered for the Trials. In the prelims in Los Angeles, Mary T qualified first with 59.05, the second-fastest performance ever, followed by Johnson with 59.99. The third-fastest qualifier was the Netherlands’ Annemarie Verstappen, but she was 1½ seconds behind Johnson.
In the final Johnson went out suicidally in 27.18 – Meagher had recorded only 27.75 in her 57.96 world record. Meagher also bettered than, turning in 27.47, and she had more left. But it took 90 metres for Meagher to finally get past Johnson, who was by then struggling. The gold medal time for Meagher was 59.26, Johnson coming home in 1:00.19, with West German Karin Seick outlasting Verstappen for bronze.

The third World Cup of the season had been won by another Dutchman, Rintje Ritsma. The third man on the team was Leo Visser, who had dominated the 1989 speed skating season. He had retired to focus on his pilot studies, but had returned to complete his prize cabinet with an Olympic gold medal, having narrowly lost the 5,000 m gold in 1988. Behind the Dutch, Norwegian skaters Johann Olav Koss and Ådne Søndrål had also posted consistent top results. But Koss, the 1990 and 1991 World Allround Champion, had recently suffered health problems. A little over a week before the Olympic 1,500 m, he had been in hospital for an inflamed pancreas. His participation in the 5,000 m (seventh) had been considered near miraculous.
The start of the race was delayed due to poor conditions, but even then ice conditions were poor. Falko Zandstra, first of the favorites to ride, had an unimpressive last lap, and his 1:56.96 was not considered medal-worthy. After an ice preparation, this was proven by Leo Visser, who skated 1:54.90 in a solid race. As Ritsma stayed well behind with 1:55.70, Visser’s hopes for a medal grew. Johann Olav Koss then copied Visser’s lap times in heat 8, and a slightly faster last lap brought him home in 1:54.81. As Visser headed off the track in disappointment, a second Norwegian also beat his time. Søndrål, too, recorded the same splits, but only just missed out on the gold with 1:54.85. While Koss celebrated his remarkable victory, Visser closed out his skating career by throwing his skates into the audience.

However, a law was discovered that prohibited any activity there at more than 20 miles per hour, so the event had to be moved to Windsor. The race started in a torrential downpour, which limited the spectators who braved the weather. The biggest problem with the course was the loose gravel roads, which caused over 100 punctures in all.
It was difficult to pick a favorite as international racing had been stalled by the war. The 1947 World Championships had been won by Italy’s Adolfo Ferrari, who raced at Windsor, but trailed in only in 9th place, the leader of the chasing group. On the second lap of the race, three riders, Nils Johansson, Gerrit Voorting, and Henk Faanhof, dropped the peleton. Johansson punctured on the 9th lap and was caught by the pack. On the 12th lap, a group of nine riders caught the leading pair. Two punctures and a crash left a group of eight leading riders to contest the final lap.

In fact, his brother, Yoshiyuki Miyake, had won the World Championships in 1969 and 1971, but he did not compete at the 1972 Olympics. The lead after the press was taken on bodyweight by Albanian Ymer Pampuri, who worked as a circus clown and was completely unknown. He would place last in the snatch, which was excusable when one understands he had never performed that lift in competition prior to the 1972 Olympics. Pampuri was tied after the press with Bulgarian Norair Nurikyan and Soviet Georgian Dito Shanidze, the 1968 Olympic silver medalist. Shanidze moved ahead after the snatch with Nurikyan 2.5 kg behind, tied with Hungarian János Benedek. In the clean & jerk, Nurikyan lifted 157.5 kg for a world record, which gave him a total of 402.5 kg, to equal Shanidze’s world record and win the gold medal.

At the 1984 US Olympic Trials, Moffett beat Lundquist for the first time and in the process, bettered his world record with 1:02.13. In training camp before the Olympics, however, Moffet injured his groin. It seemed better by the time of Los Angeles, as Moffet led the qualifiers with 1:02.16, but on the turn of that race, re-injured his groin. It was not certain if he would be able to even swim in the final. And he told Lundquist, “If something goes haywire with my leg, get the gold for the United States.” Lundquist did just that, finishing in a world record 1:01.65, the first swimmer to better 1:02 in the 100 breast, although Canada’s Victor Davis also did so in second, with 1:01.99. Four days later, he would win the 200 breaststroke. Moffet was far from his best and trailed in fifth, swimming with his upper thigh taped and having received a pain-killing injection.

He would certainly have to contend with Norway’s Knut Holmann, however, who was the defending Olympic  and four-time World Champion in this event. The last two European championships, as well as the 1997 World Championships, had been won by Hungary, who sent a new canoeist, Roland Kökény, to the Games, while 1992 Olympic champion Clint Robinson of Australia, who had taken bronze in 1996, was also present in Sydney. Javier Correa of Argentina had taken the title at the most recent Pan American Games and was also the 1998 World bronze medalist.
Liwowski defeated Kökény in the first opening heat, while Holmann bested Correa in the next and Robinson came in fourth in a heat won by Torsten Tranum of Denmark, the 1999 World bronze medalist. Michael Kolganov of Israel, the 1999 European bronze medalist, took the fourth heat. The first semi-final heat was the strongest, as it contained Holmann, who won it, Kolganov, who came in third, and Kökény and Robinson, both of whom were eliminated in favor of Tim Brabants of the United Kingdom. Tranum lost his heat to Petar Merkov of Belgium, while Liwowski was disqualified for having too many false starts in a third heat captured by Correa. With Liwowski out of the picture, Holmann paddled to a relatively easy gold medal in the final, while Merkov came in nearly a second and a half later for silver. These two canoeists would repeat their performances in the K-1 500, where the Bulgarian was again runner-up to the Norwegian. The race for bronze was an incredibly tight one between Brabants and Kolganov, with the latter missing out on becoming Israel’s first Olympic canoeing medalist by a mere 0.042 seconds. Brabants thus claimed Britain’s first Olympic canoe sprint medal, adding to the two K-1 slalom silver medals it had won in 1992 and earlier in the regatta. Kolganov, meanwhile, would receive some consolation the following day in the K-1 500, where he captured the bronze medal.

The 1980 Olympic Champion, Robert Van de Walle (BEL) appeared in control after two rounds, but lost his third match to little-known West German Marc Meiling. The final came down to Meiling against Brazil’s Aurélio Miguel, bronze medal winner at the 1987 Worlds. It was a very dull match with Miguel winning on a chui penalty given to Meiling.

As the events of Atlanta unfolded another name was added to the list of contenders as Michelle Smith of Ireland had already visited the top of the Olympic podium on three occasions.
O’Neill had burst onto the world scene as a 16-year-old in 1990 but this was to be her first global title. She led for the entirety of the race and eventually won by a large margin of 2.06 seconds. Behind her Petria Thomas took a large slice off her personal best to finish second ahead of Smith who finally lost an Olympic race.

But they had both yet to win Olympic individual gold. Novikov was now retired, but Balczó, World Champion in 1963, 1965, 1966, and 1967, was favored to win in Ciudad de México. However, the riding proved decisive as it often does. Balczó drew a poor horse and finished only 22nd in the steeplechase. His teammate, István Moná, placed second in épée fencing and moved into the lead after the second phase. After three phases, Balczó was only in sixth, with Moná still leading, followed by Sweden’s Björn Ferm, who had been third at the 1967 Worlds. Moná was not a strong swimmer and Ferm and Balczó placed second and fifth in the swim to move into first and second overall after four phases. The lead was 65 points and Balczó was considered a stronger runner than Ferm so the title was still in doubt. Balczó finished the run in 14:07.2 on the 4,000 metre course to place second, but it was not enough. He had actually closed the margin at one kilometer, but the effort was too much, and he blew up in the last half of the race. Ferm finished in 14:25.7 and fifth place in cross-country, and held onto the gold medal with an 11-point margin.
Wallechinsky has chronicled the frustrations felt by modern pentathletes who suffer a bad draw in the horse riding section. Describing the German rider, Hans-Jürgen Todt, whose horse did not finish the steeplechase with any points, Wallechinsky noted in The Complete Book of the Olympics, “After completing the  course, Todt, disconsolate at seeing his years of training gone to waste because of bad luck, attacked the horse and had to be pulled away by his teammates.”

But 17 February was a horrible day for ski racing with fog and mist making it difficult for the skiers to see the gates in the highly technical slalom race. The skiers asked for the event to be postponed but to no avail. Killy skied thru a rare break in the weather to take a small lead after the first run, 49.37 to 49.68 over Austrian Alfred Matt. Killy took the lead in the second round, but Norwegian Håkon Mjøen appeared to have bettered his overall time, only to soon be disqualified for missing two gates. Only Austrian Karl Schranz appeared able to best Killy, but in the fog, as he came to the 21st gate, Schranz stopped skiing, stating that a mystery man in black had walked out onto the course in his way. Schranz was allowed a re-start and skied perfectly, bettering Killy’s time and seemingly winning the gold medal, even going thru the post-race press conference as the winner. But it was then announced that Schranz was also disqualified, as he had apparently missed the 19th gate prior to his stopping on his original run. Schranz protested, stating that he had been distracted by the site of the interloper even before he got to gate 21. The Austrian team claimed that the mysterious guest was a French policeman who interfered with Schranz on purpose to assure Killy’s triple victory. The French countered that Schranz had made the whole thing up after missing a gate and that no such mystery man existed. Finally, the controversy went to the Jury of Appeal who supported Killy by a 3-1 margin, disqualifying Schranz, with the three votes for Killy coming from two Frenchmen and one Swiss.
The fifth-place finisher was American Vladimir “Spider” Sabich. From 1972 thru early 1976, Sabich was involved with Claudine Longet, the former wife of American singer Andy Williams. After skiing at Aspen in March 1976, Sabich returned to his home there and prepared to take a shower. The events at this point are disputed, but Spider Sabich was shot by Longet in the bathroom of their home in Aspen, and died en route to the hospital. Longet was charged with reckless manslaughter but the charge was reduced to criminally negligent homicide, a misdemeanor, of which she was convicted in 1977, for which she served 30 days in jail.

This was Tanith Belbin and Ben Agosto, skating for the United States. They had skated together since 2002, but the problem for the Olympics was that Belbin was Canadian. She received American citizenship only a few weeks before the US Trials, enabling her and Agosto to skate together at the Olympics.

In the insular world of ice dancing, in which couples rarely change their position during a competition, this seemed a death knell. But they came back to place second to Navka/Kostomarov in the optional set pattern dance, and were in second overall going into the free dance. Navka/Kostomarov won the free dance, while Belbin/Agosto struggled, placing fifth. But they were able to hold on for the silver medal, narrowly edging the Ukrainian couple of Olena Hrushyna and Ruslan Honcharov. The crowd favorites were Fusar Poli and Margaglio, but they fell twice during the original dance.

It had been a World Championship event since 2007 and, consisting of six different sub-events, no rider is likely to specialize in all of them, and thus no man had held the world title more than once. The reigning World Champion, Australia’s Glenn O’Shea, was heralded as a potential victor and a possible favorite, but the hometown advantage of Britain’s Ed Clancy could not be discounted, as he had been the 2010 World Champion. American Taylor Phinney may have been a contender, as the 2009 and 2010 individual pursuit World Champion. When individual pursuit was removed from the Olympics, Phinney briefly considered taking up omnium, but ultimately settled on the more financially lucrative road race and time trial.

The two favorites were the Americans Sydney McLaughlin and Dalilah Muhammad. Muhammad was the defending gold medallist, and had won the 2019 World Championship, in which she set the world record of 52.16, as McLaughlin finished second. McLaughlin was younger, and had competed at Rio, where she was barely 17-years-old, failing to make the final.

Muhammad got off to the fastest start and led to the eighth hurdle, with McLaughlin and Bol about a step behind and almost together. As they approached the last barrier, McLaughlin had almost caught Muhammad, who had a slight stutter step before clearing.

Further her five silver medals remains, through 2014, the most silver medals won by any athlete, male or female, at one Olympics.

There were several theories as to the favorites, but Jim Lightbody, a young Chicago runner, was not one of the prominent names mentioned.  At the start, Harvey Cohn took the lead, followed by Emil Breitkreutz and German’s Johannes Runge, with Lightbody running last in the early going.  At the 400 metre mark, Runge took over the lead, as Cohn flagged badly, and Lightbody began a sustained drive, passing the entire field on the outside.  Coming into the final stretch, Breitkreutz and George Underwood led, but Lightbody was gaining fast.  He eventually pulled away to win by two yards, with Breitkreutz holding onto second until the last yards.  He was then passed by Howard Valentine, who closed quickly. This was probably the top race of the 1904 Olympics, as several runners were so badly spent they were carried from the track in exhaustion.

Point system scoring, with yachts scoring one point for finishing a race and one point for each yacht defeated in the race.",na,"The 6 metre class had been on the Olympic Program since 1908 and would remain an Olympic class through 1952. The International Rules for the metre classes were written in October 1907. The “6” in the 6 metre class represents the product of a formula, not the length of the boat. The 6 metre boats are usually 10 to 11 metres long. The formula uses the values of boat length, beam, waterline length, skin girth and chain girth, freeboard and sail area. The result is a fixed number, which is then referred to as the ship class. The class identifier for the 6 m class was an underlined Six “6”.
Three 6 metre boats competed in six races at the 1932 Olympics, so all teams won a medal. There was not much drama in this event as the standings were the same in all six races. The Swedish yacht Bissbi, skippered by Tore Holm, dominated the regatta, winning all the races and the gold medal. Equally clear was the silver medal for the United States boat, Gallant, which took second place in all races, while Canada’s Caprice  was third throughout.

Competitors losing to the finalists entered repechage tournament for bronze medals.,na,"Besik Kudukhov of Russia had begun his career as a featherweight freestyle wrestler and had found a fair amount of success, finishing as runner-up at the 2006 World Championships before taking the World and European titles in 2007. After entering the 2008 Olympic Games as the favorite in the division, and then ending up with only a bronze medal, Kudukhov switched to the lightweight division and grew even more successful, winning the three World Championships and again earning a reputation as a favorite, this time for the London Games. Strong challenges, however, were possible from Yogeshwar Dutt of India, the reigning Asian and Commonwealth Champion and an Olympic veteran from 2004 and 2008, Toğrul Əsgərov of Azerbaijan, the reigning European Champion and 2010 World runner-up, and Franklin Gómez of Puerto Rico, the reigning Pan American Champion and runner-up in the most recent World Championships.
In the end it was Kudukhov and Əsgərov who met in the final, with the latter having the easier time advancing through his bracket. The Russian, however, arguably had the stronger opponents, having to get through Gómez, Dutt, and Iran’s Masoud Esmaeilpoor, the 2010 Asian Champion and 2012 runner-up, on his way to the gold medal match. In the final, however, it was Əsgərov who was surprisingly dominant, winning the first round with a single point and scoring three points in the first fifteen seconds of the second period. An extra two points by the end were superfluous, as the Azerbaijani unseated the World Champion and earned the Olympic crown.
The first bronze medal match was contested by Kenichi Yumoto of Japan, a bronze medalist at both the 2008 Summer Olympics and the most recent World Championships, and Coleman Scott of the United States, a rookie on the international scene. The pair were evenly matched at first, leading the first round to a par terre in which Yumoto drew the advantage and was able to convert it into a point. In the second period Scott reversed a leg hold to score two points on his opponent, which rose to three following an unsuccessful challenge from the Japanese coaches. Yumoto then scored the first point in the final round, but Scott came back in the final fifteen seconds to score three points and take the medal. For the final podium spot, it was Dutt against Ri Jong-Myong of North Korea, whose best international finish was third at the 2011 Asian Championships. Both competitors looked strong at first, with Ri and Dutt winning the first and second rounds respectively by one point. By the end of the final period, however, Dutt had scored six unanswered points against Ri, clinching the bronze.
That was how the event and the results seemed to have ended. In 2015, however, the IOC began re-testing samples from the 2008 Beijing and 2012 London Olympics, using newer, more advanced testing techniques, in an effort to find those who had used performance enhancing drugs (PEDs), but in whom it could not be detected at the time of those Olympics. This was one of the events affected, in a sense.
In December 2013, Russian silver medalist Besik Kudukhov was killed in a car accident after colliding with a truck. In October 2016, his samples from the 2012 London Olympics were re-tested and came back positive for turinabol (dehydrochloromethyltestosterone). Because he was deceased, and had no chance for an appeal, no change in the result standings, nor the medals, was made.

The reigning World Champions were Hungary’s Sándor Tótka and Péter Molnár, while their European equivalents were Nebojša Grujić and Marko Novaković of Serbia, who were also the 2014 World Champions, the 2015 European runners-up, and the 2015 World bronze medallists. One other duo of note was Germany’s Tom Liebscher and Ronald Rauhe, who were the 2014 and 2015 European Champions, the 2014 World runners-up, and the 2016 European bronze medallists. Rauhe had a long history in the sport and Olympic medals that spanned back to bronze in the K-2 500 in 2000 and included gold in the K-2 500 in 2004.
None of these individuals, however, qualified directly for the finals. Lithuania, represented by 2014 and 2015 European bronze medallists Aurimas Lankas and Edvinas Ramanauskas, won the first opening heat while Cristian Toro and Saúl Craviotto of Spain took the second. Spain had not reached the World podium in the K-2 200 since 2011, but Craviotto was a decorated canoeist who was a 2008 Olympic Champion in the K2-500 and the 2012 runner-up in the K-1 200. Hungary then won the first semifinal, while Germany and Serbia placed second and third respectively behind Liam Heath and Jon Schofield of Great Britain, the 2012 Olympic bronze medallists and 2013 World runners-up. In the mad rush of the final, the Spanish duo came out in front to win gold convincingly, but careful analysis of the results was required to determine the placement of the next six positions, as only 0.331 seconds separated them all. In the end, Great Britain nabbed silver 0.014 seconds ahead of Lithuania, who in turn captured bronze by finishing 0.03 seconds in front of Hungary. Craviotto would add to his Olympic medals two days later by taking bronze in the K-1 200.

Taylor and Medved met in round one, with Medved winning on decision after referee gave Taylor a controversial passivity penalty. They won the rest of their bouts, with the bad points Taylor accumulated by his loss to Medved eliminating him after round five, and leaving him with a bronze medal.

He was not quite as dominant in 1959 but he was still undefeated as an adult over both distances. But at the end of 1959 he moved to Portsea where he trained under the legendary coach Percy Cerutty, to prepare for the Roma Olympics. In the heats he qualified easily, with nine runners advancing. His main opposition was felt to come from France’s Michel Jazy and Hungary’s István Rózsavölgyi. The final was led out by French runner Michel Bernard, who passed 800 metres in 1:57.8 with Elliott on his shoulder. Elliott then jumped into the lead, running the next 100 in 13.2, and he stretched out the field. He reached the start line in 2:54.0 for 1,200 metres, and continued to push the pace, the field trailing far behind him.

Jazy trailed in second, almost three seconds back, with Rózsavölgyi getting the bronze medal. Thru the rest of 1960, Elliott ran numerous races, but never ran another mile or 1,500 after the end of the year. In 1961 he ran a few half-miles and then retired, never having lost at 1,500 or the mile.

Llaneras had only the fifth-most points in the race, but there were two big breaks during the race and he went with both of them, and then eventually got off the front by himself, lapping the field to win unopposed over the last few laps. Later in the year he would win the World Championships again and would return to win a second gold in the event in 2008. The race among the eight riders who were only one lap down went to the surprising Uruguayan Milton Wynants, the first-ever cycling medal for that nation. Wynants, the early leader in the race, had only qualified for the Olympics through his placing at the B World Championships.

Canada and the United States were actually now second-rate internationally, hampered by being unable to use their best skaters, all in the NHL.

This was similar to many other Olympic sports, which under IOC President Juan Antonio Samaranch, were opened to professionals in the 1980s.  Unfortunately for the United States and Canada, no NHL team allowed their players to leave their rosters for the 2 weeks of the Olympic tournament in February.  Thus the path was clear for another Soviet gold medal and they did not disappoint, clinching the gold medal prior to their final game against Finland.

One of the world’s top road racers, the winner of the Tour de France in 1997, Ullrich was a time trial specialist and was the favorite. His biggest competition was expected to come from Lance Armstrong. Armstrong had competed in both the 1992 and 1996 Olympics, but had not yet an Olympic medal. Shortly after the 1996 Olympics, he was discovered to have testicular cancer, which had metastasized to his brain and liver. Enduring long courses of chemotherapy, and several surgeries, his return to the professional peloton was in doubt. But return he did, winning the Tour de France in both 1999 and 2000, with Ullrich second in 2000, and Armstrong would eventually win the race seven consecutive times – 1999-2005. Also formidable in the time trial, the race was expected to come down to these two, and they were the last two riders off. The 25th rider to start, of 38, was Russian Vyacheslav Yekimov. Yekimov, a 1988 gold medalist in the team pursuit and former world champion in the individual pursuit, was now a top professional road racer, and had served as a capable lieutenant on Armstrong’s US Postal Service team. He had a very long career and in the late 80s, had been the top individual pursuiter in the world for the Soviet Union. When Yekimov started the time trial, the leader was Kazakh Andrey Teteryuk but Yekimov finished in 57:40, besting Teteryuk by over a minute. And the time held up as numerous top pros had failed to better it by the time Armstrong and Ullrich started. At the first checkpoint, they trailed Yekimov’s time, and they were never able to get ahead of him, as Yekimov won a very surprising gold medal, with Ullrich second and Armstrong seemingly winning his only Olympic medal, a bronze.
Even though Armstrong was the dominant cyclist of the decade whispers of drug use continued to haunt him. He may have retired with the reputation intact but the United States Anti-Doping agency were hard on his trail. In August 2012 they announced that their long investigation had concluded that he had used illegal performance-enhancing drugs from 1998 onwards and they voided his results for the period of his greatest successes including all his Tour De France victories. His Olympic medal was also forfeited.

In round one, American thrower Stephanie Brown Trafton opened a big lead with 64.74 (212-5), and that was all she would need to win the gold medal, eventually winning by 1.10 metres over Cuba’s Yarelis Barrios. Barrios got her best throw in round two. Brown Trafton struggled after her opener with three fouls, and her next best throw was only 61.30 (201-1), but the opener was all she needed. This was the first throwing gold medal by an American woman since 1932. Brown Trafton had almost no international experience, competing at Athina in 2004, but not making the final. She had never ranked in the world top ten, her best year-end American ranking had been 3rd  in 2004 and 2006, and she had placed only third at the US Olympic Trials prior to Beijing. But she was the world list leader coming into the Olympics, although that throw (66.17 [217-1]) had been done with some helpful winds.
That was how the event and the results seemed to have ended. In 2015, however, the IOC began re-testing samples from the 2008 Beijing and 2012 London Olympics, using newer, more advanced testing techniques, in an effort to find those who had used performance enhancing drugs (PEDs), but in whom it could not be detected at the time of those Olympics. This was one of the many events affected.
In September 2016 Yarelis Barrios (CUB) was revealed to have a positive re-test for acetazolamide, and was disqualified, losing her silver medal. Ukrainian Olena Antonova was advanced to the silver medal, and China’s Song Aimin was advanced to the bronze medal. In 2012 Barrios benefited from re-testing when she was moved up to a bronze medal after the disqualification of Russian Darya Pishchalnikova.

Poland thus settled for silver while Romania came in nearly three seconds later for bronze. This was Popescu and Pricop’s second medal of the regatta, as they had won the C-2 1000 the previous day.

Furthermore, the event had been won at the last two Olympics by Pertti Karppinen of Finland, who was the favorite to defend his crown for a third time in Los Angeles. Unlike in 1980, however, he would not go unchallenged, as he would face West Germany’s Peter-Michael Kolbe, the 1976 Olympic runner-up and a four-time World Champion. The threat from Argentina’s Ricardo Ibarra, three-time Pan-American champion and winner of the 1980 Diamond Challenge Sculls at the Henley Royal Regatta, could not be ignored either.
The opening round was dominated by Karppinen, who finished over three seconds ahead of the other heat winner, Robert Mills of Canada, and over seven and a half seconds faster than Kolbe, the runner-up in the Finn’s heat. Mills was new to the international scene, having made his début at the 1983 Pan American Games, but he had already gold medals in the double and quadruple sculls. He was not usually a single sculler, but attempted to qualify for Canada in that event after tensions rose concerning his placement on the quadruple sculls crew. Karppinen and Mills faced each other in the semi-finals and the Canadian forced the Finn into his smallest margin of victory of the last two Olympics. In the other semi-final heat, meanwhile, Kolbe barely scraped by with a victory over Ibarra. In the final, however, Kolbe, and especially Karppinen, were untouchable. Finland won gold with room to breathe while West Germany took silver over eight seconds ahead of bronze medalist Mills. Karppinen therefore became the second single sculler, after Vyacheslav Ivanov of the Soviet Union, to win the event at three consecutive Olympics.

He was the hot favorite for another Olympic gold and was heading a strong East German team with the silver medalist from the 1974 World Championships Günther  Deckert and two promising youngsters, Konrad Winkler and Claus Tuchscherer on the team.
In ski jumping, Wehling showed excellent form, having the longest and best jump in all three rounds. His Finnish rival, Olympic silver medalist from 1972 Rauno Miettinen was in second place, followed by two more East Germans, Tuchscherer and Winkler.
Wehling, normally considered a better cross-country skier than Miettinen, started three minutes behind the Finn and could easily control his rival in the 15 km cross-country event the day after. The surprise of the event was Urban Hettich, a West German from Schwarzwald, who had been very satisfied with his 11th place in the jumping event. He skied excellently, posting the fastest time of the day, over a minute better than the second best, Norwegian Stein Erik Gullikstad. Hettich advanced to the silver medal position, beating Winkler by a scant margin in the final classification. Miettinen could do no better than 19th place in the cross-country, dropping from second to fourth, barely beating Tuchscherer in fifth place. Gullikstad, placing 30th out of 33 in the jumping event, was far behind in the total points, but the third fastest in the cross-country race, while the Soviet Union’s Nikolay Nogovitsyn advanced from 16th to sixth place. Wehling, still only 23, became the second skier to defend his Olympic gold in Nordic Combined after Johan Grøttumsbråten did it in Lake Placid 44 years earlier.

In the final, McDonald improved with both hands and led until Rose’s very last throw with his left hand.  Until then, Rose was in third place, still trailing the other two finalists.

With the invitation of the North and South Korean teams, the quota jumped to 22 teams – South Korea as hosts. Sixteen quotas were given at the 2017 World Figure Skating Championships and four were given at the 2017 CS Nebelhorn Trophy in Germany (where North Korea originally qualified, but did not register its athletes in time due to not knowing if they were even going to PyeongChang.) The Olympic competition was held at the Gangneung Ice Arena with the short program held on 14 February and the free skating on 15 February 2018.
Entering PyeongChang 2018, it was going to be a two-pair race for gold with the emotional edge going to Germany’s Aljona Sawtchenko and Bruno Massot.
Sawtchenko, the five-time World champion who, with her new partner of 3 ½ years and Olympic rookie Massot, was competing in her fifth Olympic Games and mining for gold, having won bronzes in Vancouver 2010 and Sochi 2014 with Robin Szolkowy. PyeongChang was perhaps the best chance Sawtchenko ever had to win the gold. Interestingly, neither she nor Massot were originally from Germany. She made her Olympic début representing Ukraine in Salt Lake City 2002 with Stanislav Morozov.  Massot was a native Frenchman who had to acquire German citizenship to compete at the Olympics with Sawtchenko.
Sui Wenjing and Han Cong of China arrived in PyeongChang as the reigning World champions and even after Sui’s surgeries on both feet in 2016, they won four events in a row, before having their streak snapped by Sawtchenko and Massot at the 2017 Grand Prix Final.  They would need two flawless skates to climb to the top of the Olympic podium. The difference between the German and Chinese teams would lie in the components, especially in the free skate.
The team that could upset the two favourites were the Russians, or “Olympic Athletes from Russia” (OAR), Yevgeniya Tarasova and Vladimir Morozov, the 2017 World bronze medalists. They were turning heads, not only with their quadruple twist, but with their win in the pairs event in the 2018 Olympic team competition.
Canadians Meagan Duhamel and Eric Radford, the two-time World champions (2015, 2016), were full of confidence having won Olympic gold in the 2018 team event (where Radford became the first openly gay man to win a gold medal in a Winter Olympics) and would make one last run at the Olympic podium after a season of soul-searching.
After the short program, China’s reigning World champions Sui and Han scored 82.39 points for their flawless skate to k.d. lang’s version of “Hallelujah.” Tarasova and Morozov, the last team to go, bumped the Canadians down to third with an 81.68 points skate, and were sitting in second place, less than one point separating them from the Chinese. Unfortunately, Germany’s Massot doubled a planned triple salchow, landing them in fourth with 76.59 points.
Entering the free skate long program, Savchenko and Massot set a record with their score of 159.31 for a total of 235.90 points, rising from fourth to first – and winning the first pairs medal for Germany since 1952. Savchenko tied the medal record in Olympic pairs skating with three medals (with two different partners).
Sui and Han of China made a couple of mistakes in the free program, and won the silver – the first Olympic medal in pairs skating for China since the team’s coach, Zhao Hongbo, won gold in Vancouver 2010 (with Shen Xue.
The Canadians Duhamel and Radford, who were seventh in Sochi 2014, remained solid and held on to their third position for the bronze medal.  They were the first Canadian pairs team to win an Olympic medal since Jamie Sale and David Pelletier, who shared gold with Russians Yelena Berezhnaya and Anton Sikharulidze in the 2002 Olympic Winter Games at Salt Lake City.
Russians Tarasova and Morozov, skated last in the long program, and let their nerves get to them, committing two major errors dropping them to fourth and off the podium.
This was the second Olympics since 1964 that a Soviet or Russian pair did not win a medal.
