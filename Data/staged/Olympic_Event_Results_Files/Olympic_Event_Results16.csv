The favorite in the final was America’s John Woodruff. As in 1932, the final pace was led out by Canada’s Phil Edwards, who had made his third consecutive final in the event. Woodruff took the lead at the bell, with Italy’s Mario Lanzi lagging in eighth place, despite the very slow pace (57.4). But he moved up on the last lap, getting to third by the straight. He would finish quickly for the silver medal, but there was no catching Woodruff, who had increased his lead on the final lap, only to ease up near the finish for a two-metre victory over Lanzi. In July 1939, Rudolf Harbig would shatter the world record, running 1:46.6, a mark which would last until 1955.

The USA pulled out to a 2-0 lead after two periods, but Sweden fought back and tied the game, 2-2.  The game went to a shoot-out and Sweden’s Pernilla Winberg scored the only goal to lead her team to a 3-2 victory.  It was the first time that the United States or Canada had lost an international game to any team other than themselves.  The final was anti-climactic, Canada winning 4-1, over Sweden.  The US rebounded to win the bronze medal over Finland, 4-0.

Sadly, due to her problems, Biles withdrew from the event, which enabled Great Britain’s Jennifer Gadirova to compete alongside her twin sister Jessica. With the defending champion Biles again out of the apparatus final, Ferrari was likely to find opposition in another American, Jade Carey, and the new Brazilian individual all-round silver medallist Rebeca Andrade.
The second onto the floor was Carey and she set a strong mark of 14.366 with a well-executed routine. Angelina Melnikova of the ROC finished seventh in qualification, but her 14.166 put her in second place until the next up, Ferrari, put herself between Carey and Melnikova and into the silver medal position. Japan’s women’s gymnastics captain Mai Murakami tied with Melnikova with 14.166 and with that they could not be separated after identical E (execution) and D (difficulty) scores and were sharing the bronze medal, but with Andrade still to perform her routine. Unfortunately for her, she received only 14.033 points and was out of the medals as Carey collected the USA’s second gold of Tokyo 2020, while Ferrari won her first Olympic medal in her fourth Games.
Since her début Olympics at Rio, Mai Murakami’s career had been a roller coaster. In winning the floor gold medal at the 2017 World Championships, she became the first Japanese woman in 63 years to win a world title. The following year she was the individual all-round silver medallist, another first for a female Japanese gymnast. In 2019, however, she suffered a serious back injury that threatened her career, but now, two years later, that was all forgotten as she was the proud owner of an Olympic medal.

Maciej Freimut of Poland, a 1992 Olympic runner-up, had a new partner in Adam Wysocki, with whom he had been third in this event at the 1995 World Championships. Poland was second to Italy in the opening heats, while Germany and the Hungarian duo of Krisztián Bártfai and Zsolt Gyulay,the 1995 World runners-up, took a third heat. The Hungarians and Poles were then fourth and third in respectively in semi-final heats won by Italy and Germany. Hungary led the final for most of the course, but a flurry of activity saw them passed by five other nations, most notably Germany, who charged towards the finish line and managed to hold off the Italians by a mere 0.032 seconds to defend their title and get their revenge on Scarpa, who had helped deny them gold in the K-1 1000 (Bonomi had spent that day winning silver in the K-1 1000). Australia’s Danny Collins and Andrew Trim, meanwhile, were the surprise bronze medalists, stealing third place from Russians Oleg Goroby and Anatoly Tishchenko by 0.268 seconds.

El Guerrouj won the World Championship in 1997, 1999, 2001, and 2003, but he had only known Olympic disappointment. His leading opposition in 2004 was felt to be Kenya’s Bernard Lagat, who now lived and trained in the United States. Lagat had finished second at the 2001 World Championship, behind El Guerrouj, and had defeated him a few weeks before the Olympics in Zürich. In the final, the pace started out slowly and then slowed down even more on the second lap. El Guerrouj began to push the pace after 700 metres, and strung the field out. He was chased by Lagat, but he could never get past, as El Guerrouj ran his third lap in 54.8. Over the last lap, El G continued his sustained pace, holding on to win the gold medal, with Lagat getting the silver. Portugal’s Rui Silva closed quickly for the bronze medal. All three medalists ran the last 800 between 1:46.3 and 1:46.7. El Guerrouj finally had his Olympic gold medal. Four days later, he would contest the 5,000 metre final, and the runners refused to set a fast pace, setting it up for El G’s kick, and he won his second gold medal comfortably.
In March 2005, Bernard Lagat announced he had become an American citizen in May 2004 but competed for his native Kenya in Athens. Kenya does not allow dual citizenship so when this was revealed his silver medal was at stake, but he was allowed to retain it; however, he was banned from international competition for 2 years. He returned in 2007, competing for the United States at the World Championships in Osaka, and won the 1,500 metres and 5,000 metres.

After the short program, the bronze medallists from 2006, China’s Shen Xue and Zhao Hongbo held a slender lead of 0.7 points over the reigning World Champions Aljona Sawtchenko and Robin Szolkowy (GER), with reigning European Champions Yuko Kavaguti and Aleksandr Smirnov (RUS) a further 1.8 points behind. In the free skate, the Russians’ performance contained a number of errors that relegated them to fourth place. The German pair also skated a program with errors and eventually finished with the bronze medal. The outstanding free skate performance was done by China’s Pang Qing and Tong Jian, former world champions who moved up from fourth place to take the silver medal. The leaders after the short program, Shen and Zhao, skated well enough to take the gold medal, posting the second highest score of the free programme. This was the first time since 1960 that a Russian or Soviet pair had not won the gold medal in this event, and was the first ever gold medal in figure skating for China. Two medalists, Sawchenko and Kavaguti, did not compete for their native countries, as Sawchenko was Ukrainian and Kavaguti (Kawaguchi) was Japanese.

Ironically, the largest man to set foot in the Olympic ring may well have been one of the referees, Captain Mabbutt of the USA. The crowd was often heard shouting “Sit down!” when he was obstructing their view of the fighting.
Alberto Lovell of Argentina, considered by his countrymen as a “new Jack Dempsey”, defeated future European amateur champion Gunnar Bärlund of Finland in the opening round then demolished the unfortunate Canadian George Maughan to reach the final. The California native, Fred Feary, lost to Italian southpaw Luigi Rovati in the other semi-final. The Argentine favoured power over finesse but his performance was enough to edge his way to a points victory and take the gold medal and become the first black Olympic heavyweight champion.
If Lovell expected a hero’s welcome back in Buenos Aires, it certainly did not happen. An argument over the standard of food provided on the boat journey home led to Lovell punching one of the ship’s officers, this led to a near-riot involving other members of the Argentine Olympic squad. Singled out as a ringleader, Lovell was kept in custody for the rest of the voyage. Rather than being greeted with a ticker-tape reception he was instead escorted to the nearest police station.
Although Lovell was knocked out in his professional début, he went on to have a long and successful career. Holder of the Argentine heavyweight title for fifteen years, he was also South American champion and only lost eight of his eighty-eight fights. His second knockout defeat came in his last fight, at the hands of the great American stylist, Archie Moore. Lovell came from a family of heavyweight boxers, his brother Guillermo was the silver medallist four years later in Berlin. His son Santiago boxed in Tokyo and went on to box professionally with some success and another son, Pedro, was also a professional fighter and played the part of “Spider Rico” in the first and last “Rocky” movies.

On this day, however, they had two great hopes: cyclist Bradley Wiggins in the men’s time trial and rowers Helen Glover and Heather Stanning in the women’s coxless pairs. Glover and Stanning had the first chance and were heavily favored, having arrived at the Games with a string of victories in the event over the season. If anyone could challenge them it would be the New Zealand squad rowed by Juliette Haigh and Rebecca Scown, who together had won the World Championships in the event the past two years and were known for their sprinting prowess in the final strech. Also in contention were two of Romania’s most decorated Olympians, Georgeta Damian-Andrunache and Viorica Susanu, who had won the event in the past three editions of the Games, in addition to victories in the eights in 2000 and 2004.
Glover and Stanning got off to an excellent start in the heats, setting an Olympic record in the event of 6:57.29 and pointedly establishing themselves as the duo to beat. Haigh and Scown fell behind former eights World Champions Kate Hornsey and Sarah Outhwaite-Tait of Australia, but still managed to make the final. Damian-Andrunache and Susanu finished third in their heat after a surprising effort from the American duo Sarah Hendershot and Sarah Zelenka, but made the final by emerging victorious in the repêchage. The final, however, was no contest: Glover and Stanning were at least a boat length ahead for much of the race and, despite last minute pushes from Australia and New Zealand, captured the gold in front of a large, roaring crowd. It was not only the first gold medal for Britain at the 2012 Games, but also the first Olympic gold medal for women’s rowing in the nation. Australia and New Zealand finished with the silver and bronze medals respectively.

At the 1979 World Championships, American Bart Conner had won the gold medal, and he would win the 1984 Olympic gold medal, with the silver medal shared by his teammate Kurt Thomas and Soviet Aleksandr Tkachyov. After team qualifying Tkachyov was tied with Bulgarian Stoyan Delchev, but Delchev struggled in the final and placed only fifth.

Only the two Greeks, Nikolaos Andriakopoulos and Thomas Xenakis succeeded in climbing all the way to the top, with Andriakopoulos winning the championship based on a faster time, although Xenakis’ time is not recorded.  Andriakopoulos was the first to climb, followed by Xenakis, Fritz Hoffmann, Launceston Elliot, and Viggo Jensen, in that order.

All three qualified easily as Australia cruised in the preliminary round, winning by almost three seconds over the USA with China third. Australia would use an entirely new squad in the final, while the United States subbed in two swimmers and China one.
The biggest surprise of the event happened on the first leg as Yang Junxuan came home in the lead over Australia’s Ariarne Titmus, who had won the 200 free the day before, in which Yang finished only fourth. China was never headed, maintaining the lead after every leg, with Li Bingjie coming home for the gold medal.

Crouser had not won the 2019 World Championship, losing by a centimetre to his teammate Joe Kovacs, but he had since re-written the all-time performance list. He had broken the world record with 23.37 at the US Olympic Trials and had multiple throws over 75 feet (22.86). The three medallists were back with Kovacs and New Zealander Tom Walsh still expected to challenge for medals.
In round one of the final Crouser took the lead with an Olympic record 22.83, the #13 performance of all-time. He extended that lead in round two with 22.93, the #4 performance ever. He continued his amazing series, bettering the pre-Tokyo Olympic record with all six throws, and finally, in round six, tossing 23.30, a mark bettered only by his own world record. His average throw in the finals was 22.87, a mark surpassed by only four other throwers.
Behind Crouser, Kovacs and Walsh contested the other medals, as the other competitors were basically a sideshow. Kovacs threw 22.19 in round one to stand second, while in round four he would improve to 22.65, with Walsh in third at 22.17. Walsh improved in round five with 22.18, but still stood third. In the final round Walsh threw 22.47 to solidify bronze while Kovacs threw 22.60, not enough to improve but a significant throw, and he would win silver.
In the end the podium was as expected – Crouser gold, Kovacs silver, Walsh bronze – which was the exact same podium as at Rio de Janeiro in 2016. After 125 years of modern Olympic Games, that marked the first time in Olympic history that an individual podium in any sport or event had been exactly the same at two consecutive Olympic Games.

The United States had won the 1984 and 1988 gold medals. But their best player, Karch Kiraly, had turned to beach volleyball, and they were no longer the best team in the world without him. The two favorites were Brazil and Italy. Italy had won the 1990 World Championships, the 1989 European Championships, and was the World League Champion in 1990-92.
In the first match of the tournament, Japan led the US two sets to one, and 14-13 in the fourth, when American Bob Samuelson was given a yellow card. As it was his second yellow card of the match, he should have been disqualified and the point, and the match, awarded to Japan. But the US came back to win in five sets after the referee waived off the disqualification. The USA had seemingly come back to win the fourth set, 17-16, and then won the fifth set, 16-14, to win the match.  The next day Japan protested. It was upheld, and Japan was awarded the match, winning in four sets, 15-13 in the fourth. Samuelson was bald, so in his support, the US players shaved their heads before their next match. The USA made it to the medal round, but were soundly beaten by Brazil in four sets in the semi-final.
In the quarter-finals, the Netherlands shocked the favored Italians, winning 17-16 in the fifth set, and made it to the final, defeating Cuba in the semis. Brazil won the final easily in straight sets, 15-12, 15-8, 15-5. The Dutch team was the tallest in the tournament, averaging 2 metres (6-7) in height). The Dutch were coached by Arie Selinger, a Polish-born concentration camp survivor, who emigrated to Israel and later became a US citizen. He coached the US women’s team between 1975 and 1984, culminating in a silver medal in Los Angeles for the American women. He then started coaching the Dutch men’s team, which also included his son, Avital Selinger.

The winner of the 500 m, Wang Meng, was a sprint specialist, while the winner of the 1,500 m, Zhou Yang, was more of a distance skater. Based on statistics, Wang seemed to have the upper hand, having won the last two world titles in the event, with Zhou finishing second in 2008. Wang also held the world record in the distance. However, Zhou had beaten her earlier in the season, at the World Cup in Montréal, although Wang had taken the distance’s World Cup.
In the quarter-finals, Zhou lowered the Olympic Record to below 1:30.000, but it would not hold for long. In the semi-finals, she went even faster, bettering the world record to 1:29.049, with Park Seung-Hui (South Korea) also beating the old mark. In other semi-final, Wang was narrowly defeated by Katherine Reutter. Early on in the final, Zhou attempted to pass Reutter on the inside, with Wang trying the same on the outside. Impeding Reutter with this move, Zhou knew she was out of contention and fell back, to be disqualified later. This left the field open for Wang, who outpowered Reutter and Park with apparent ease.
Wang’s gold medal for China meant the Chinese had won all four of the women’s short track speed skating events at the Vancouver Olympics; the first time any country achieved this since the sport’s inclusion in 1992. She also equalled the record of four Olympic short track golds, previously held only by Jeon I-Gyeong (South Korea).

But after the 1996 Olympics he moved up to the light-heavies and became virtually unbeatable. He won the 1997 World Championships and the European titles in 1998 and 2000. In Sydney he won three of his first four bouts by TKO, his only close match coming in the quarter-finals against France’s John Dovi, silver medalist at the 1999 Worlds, winning by a 13-11 decision.

Top Australian player Adam Scott withdrew early, and was almost virulent in his criticism of Olympic golf even being on the program. When he was joined in withdrawal by top ranked players Jordan Spieth, Jason Day, Rory McIlroy, and Dustin Johnson, the press wondered if golf would even survive as an Olympic sport after Rio.
Many top players did compete, however, including Justin Rose, Henrik Stenson, and the American foursome of Rickie Fowler, Bubba Watson, Matt Kuchar, and Patrick Reed. After two rounds, relatively obscure Australian Marcus Fraser led over Belgian Thomas Pieters and the critics were up again, saying that the tournament was hurt by the absence of so many top players. However, Rose was in third and Stenson was fourth, and when Fraser and Pieters stumbled in round three, Rose took the lead with Stenson second. Stenson shot 68 in the final round, but could not catch Rose, who fired 67 to win by two shots. Kuchar was another shot back in bronze medal position. With an exciting final two rounds, enthusiastic galleries, and three medalists who were acknowledged to be among the top players in the world, many of the complaints about Olympic golf seemed ill-founded.

Due to the postponement of the men’s downhill, the event was held on the same day, with the starting times adjusted so as not to clash with the men.
Three racers shared the wins in the six events held in the ongoing giant slalom World Cup, with Mikaela Shiffrin winning the first two races, in Sölden and Courchevel 1, while Tessa Worley won in Lienz, and Sara Hector in Courchevel 2, and also the last two races before the Games, in Kranjska Gora, and Kronzplatz. Hector also led the World Cup standings followed by Worley and Shiffrin.
The Crystal Globes in this event had been won by Viktoria Rebensburg (2018), who had retired in 2020, Mikaela Shiffrin (2019), Federica Brignone (2020), and Marta Bassino (2021), but the last two World Championships had been won by Petra Vlhová (2019) and Lara Gut-Behrami (2021). During the current season Gut-Behrami contested only two of the six races also because of a COVID-19 illness. Shiffrin was also the gold medallist from PyeongChang, with Mowinckel winning silver and Brignone taking bronze.
Skiers from 49 different nations started the race, which was a record for female Alpine skiing events. The race was started by Vlhová but she was soon overtaken by the next racer, Michelle Gisin. Brignone started next and bettered Gisin’s time by 1.21 seconds. Worley wearing bib number 4 was not able to reach Brignone, being 0.95 seconds behind. After Bassino did not finish her run, it was Hector who took the lead by 42/100ths of a second. As Shiffrin was also not able to finish the race, others took their chance with Katharina Truppe surprisingly finishing in second place, only 3/10ths behind Hector, and also Meta Hrovat (fourth), Ragnhild Mowinckel (fifth), and Nina O’Brien (sixth) bringing themselves into the top positions.
On the second run Coralie Frasse Sombet, who was 26th on the first run, set the early pace with what was finally the third best time of the second run, to finish 17th overall. Vlhová, only 13th after the first run, was not in contention and did not improve on the second run, finishing 14th overall. The second-best time on run two brought Thea Stjernesund down from 15th after run one, to a final sixth place. The best run time was set by Gut-Behrami, which was good enough for bronze as, of those in the top three after the first run, only Truppe dropped to an unfortunate fourth place, 0.08 seconds away from bronze. Brignone took silver while Hector brought down her lead to win Sweden’s first gold medal in this event since Pernilla Wiberg back in 1992. Hector (gold) and Gut-Behrami (bronze) used Head skis, while Brignone (silver) raced Rossignol and Truppe (fourth) Fischer.
After Shiffrin did not finish the first run, the second run cased more back luck for Team USA as O’Brien endured troubles shortly before the finish line. She crashed into the last gate and badly fell into the finish area. After several minutes of first-aid she was transported to hospital where she was treated for an open left tibia and fibula fracture.
Finishing 38th in this event was Aruwin Salehhuddin, who became the first ever female Winter Olympics competitor for Malaysia, and the last finisher Kiana Kryeziu achieved the same claim for her country Kosovo. Sarah Escobar was the first ever Winter Olympian from Ecuador, while Noa Szőllős and Gwyneth Ten Raa became the first ever female Alpine skier for Israel and Luxembourg, respectively.

Rounding out the four favorites was Kreiner’s teammate, Doris Günther, runner-up at the 2009 World Championships and 2008-09 World Cup. Of note, the World Cup standings are for parallel snowboarding, which includes parallel GS and parallel slalom, which is not an Olympic event. Kreiner led the qualifying followed by Sauerbreij, the event being held in torrential rain and poor visibility. When the elimination phase of the event started, Kreiner advanced to the semi-final round with relative ease when her opponents made errors in their races. Sauerbreij also made the semi-finals, again helped by opponents’ faults. The other semi-finalists were Russian Yekaterina Ilyukhina, who had taken out Kober in the quarter-finals, and German Selina Jörg, who had just defeated Austrian Ina Meschik by the narrow margin of 0.08 seconds in the quarter-finals, after taking out Günther in the first round.
In the semi-finals, Ilyukhina crashed out in the first run, but a mistake by Kreiner in the second run saw the Russian advance to the final. Georg had led Sauerbreij narrowly after their first run, but crashed out near the end of the second run when they were neck and neck. Kreiner comfortably won the contest for the bronze medal following mistakes by her opponent. The final was a thriller, with Ilyukhina leading Sauerbreij by 0.02 seconds after the first run. However, in a close contest, it was Sauerbreij who took the title by the narrow margin of 0.23 seconds. This was the first medal of any kind that the Netherlands had won in a “snow” event, all their previous medals being in “ice” sports.

All their hopes rested on Jessica Ennis, who had finished second at the 2011 Worlds. Chernova towered over Ennis, but the smaller Brit was very good in the hurdles and long jump, making up her for size disadvantage. Ukrainian Nataliya Dobrynska was the defending champion and considered a challenger for gold again. The three had shared the #1 world ranking since 2008, with Dobrynska leading in 2008, Ennis in 2009-10, and Chernova in 2011. Another medal contender was American Hyleas Fountain, the Beijing silver medalist, but she had injury issues. Both Fountain and Dobrynska would eventually drop out of the competition, Fountain after the javelin and Dobrynska after the long jump.
Ennis opened up with her best event, the high hurdles, and jumped to an early lead with 12.54, the best ever mark posted in a heptathlon, and one which would have placed her fourth in the open high hurdles. She maintained her lead with a 1.86 high jump, with Fountain moving into second place, only 25 points back. Chernova was only 16th after the second event. Chernova’s gold medal hopes went awry in the shot put, when she posted only 14.17, not even equalling Ennis’s throw of 14.28. Chernova was mired in 13th place, while Ennis dropped to second, behind Lithuanian Austra Skujytė, whose throw of 17.31 was an all-time heptathlon record. The first day ended with Ennis moving well back into the lead with a 200 time of 22.83 for 4,158 points, Skujtė in second but almost 200 points behind. Chernova moved up to ninth after day one.
On day two Chernova improved with a long jump of 6.54, which led the hept, and moved her up to third place. But Ennis nearly matched that with a jump of 6.48 and increased her lead over Skujtė to 258 points. Ennis then threw a PR 47.49 in the javelin which all but secured her the gold medal. Skujtė still trailed in second, with Chernova now only sixth.
The 800 began in the dark of a Saturday evening that would prove mystical for British fans. As Ennis was about to start her 800, British long jumper Greg Rutherford recorded a mark that would win him the gold medal a few moments later. Ennis refused to jog the 800, leading the first lap in 1:01.89, and coming home in 2:08.65 for a gold medal by over 300 points as the British crowd went crazy. Behind her, German Lilli Schwarzkopf moved up from fifth place with a 2:10.50 to earn silver, and Chernova’s 2:09.56 brought her the bronze medal, as Skujtė could only run 2:20.59 and dropped back to fifth, also trailing Ukrainian Liudmyla Iosypenko.
Shortly after Ennis won her gold medal, the men’s 10,000 metres started and Britain’s Mo Farah won another British gold medal, to the delight of the adoring crowd. Three British golds in one night were highlighted by Jessica Ennis proving herself the world’s greatest woman athlete.
That was how the event and the results seemed to have ended. In 2015, however, the IOC began re-testing samples from the 2008 Beijing and 2012 London Olympics, using newer, more advanced testing techniques, in an effort to find those who had used performance enhancing drugs (PEDs), but in whom it could not be detected at the time of those Olympics. This was one of the many events affected.
The original bronze medalist, Tatyana Chernova of Russia had a positive re-test announced for turinabol (dehydrochloromethyltestosterone) in November 2016, and lost her bronze medal. Chernova appealed to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) but lost that appeal in July 2017. Chernova also lost a bronze medal in this event from the 2008 Beijing Olympics, after a similar positive re-test for turinabol was announced in April 2017, although she appealed that decision.
The original fourth-place finisher in the 2012 heptathlon, Liudmyla Iosypenko of Ukraine was disqualified in June 2014 for a biological passport offense, and thus could not move up to a medal position. Chernova’s bronze medal was later given to Austra Skujytė of Lithuania.

Similarly, the 1973 World Champion and 1975 runner-up, Miklós Darvas of Hungary, did not attend the Montreal Games and his nation sent Károly Szegedi, runner-up in the C-1 10000 at the 1975 World Championships, in his place. This left Romania’s Ivan Patzaichin and Bulgaria’s Borislav Ananiev, the 1973/1974 and 1975 bronze medalists respectively, as the only World Championship medalists competing in the event, which made the field in Montreal fairly open.
The opening heats were won by Yugoslavia’s Matija Ljubek and East Germany’s Wilfried Stephan, the latter of whom was representing the 1974 World runner-up nation. Ljubek’s feat, meanwhile, was even more impressive because he defeated Szegedi, Ananiev, Rogov, Patzaichin, and eventual silver medalist John Wood of Canada. Rogov, at least, was able to get revenge in the semi-finals, as he won his heat and bested Ljubek in the process, while the other heats went to Stephan and Szegedi. With such a strong and close field, most spectators expected an exciting finale, and the canoeists did not disappoint. As they approached the finish line, Ananiev, Ljubek, Rogov, Stephan, and Wood were all contenders for the gold medal, until the East German began to fall slightly behind. This left four Olympians for three podium spots and they all crossed the line within 0.69 seconds of each other. The top three, Rogov, Wood, and Ljubek in that order, were even closer, separated by only 0.37 seconds. Although Ljubek’s bronze might have been disappointing in consideration of his earlier performance, he would go to win the C-1 1000 and earn Yugoslavia its first two Olympic canoeing medals.

There were four balloon events contested for longest time travelled, two with handicaps, one without handicap, and what was termed a second-degree event which was only open to balloonists who had won prizes in the first three events. This event was won by Jacques Balsan, who also won the longest time aloft event without handicap. He was aloft for 18 hours, 4 minutes, covering 270 km and landing near Boussac-Bourg, Creuse in France. Balsan had two assistants onboard, Louis Godard and Genty, and he received a gilded plaque valued at 500 francs.

This event was expected to be contested between these two. But despite her recent loss, Kaiser had to be favored. She had also won the 1967 World Championship, winning the 3K en route, and had set the last three world records. The most recent had been set nine days before this event in Davos, avenging her loss to Schut, recording 4:54.6.
Their teammate, Wil Burgmeijer, was in the first pair and broke the Olympic record with 5:05.1 for a mark to shoot at, though it would eventually bring her only fifth. Schut was in the fifth pair and blasted through the laps in 4:56.2, the third fastest time ever. Kaiser was in the 12th pair. She was hampered by rain that had started to fall, quickly dropped off Schut’s pace, and was four seconds behind at 1,000 metres. And she would never close that gap, finishing in 5:01.3, also behind Kaija Mustonen, who had finished in 5:01.0 in the seventh pair. In the end that was the podium with Schut getting gold, Mustonen silver, and Kaiser bronze.
Schut had been a top distance skater but she had often finished second at 3,000, usually to Kaiser. But in coming years, she would win the distance frequently, at the 1969 and 1970 World Championships and the 1970 European Championships. Kaiser had a difficult Grenoble Olympics, winning disappointing bronze medals in the 1,500 and 3,000, but she returned in 1972 at Sapporo and win gold in the 3,000.

The race was conceded to the US team, with Phelps swimming fly, the backstroke being led by 100 gold medalist Matt Grevers, the free leg going to 100 gold medalist Nathan Adrian, and the breaststroke leg being swum by Brendan Hansen, bronze medalist in the 100 breast. But surprisingly, Japan’s Ryosuke Irie kept them close on the backstroke leg, just behind Grevers, and Kosuke Kitajima, legendary breaststroker who had won the 100-200 double in 2004 and 2008, put Japan ahead as he outswam Hansen on the breaststroke leg.
Phelps then took over and pulled ahead but Japan’s Takeshi Matsuda would not give in and the US led Japan by only 0.26 seconds at the final changeover, but Nathan Adrian was too strong for the Japanese anchor, Takuro Fujii, and the USA had gold in 3:29.35, as Adrian split 46.85 for his freestyle leg. Behind him, Takuro held on for silver, narrowly holding off Australia’s James Magnussen in the freestyle.
For Phelps, this was his third consecutive gold medal in the medley relay, which he had also done in the 4×200 free relay, and in two individual events, the 100 butterfly, and 200 IM. He finished with 22 medals, 18 gold medals, 13 individual medals, and 11 individual gold medals, all Olympic bests. In London he won six medals, and four gold medals.

It was also the first men’s cross-country event in Salt Lake City, starting shortly after the women finished racing 15 km. There was no suspense over the winner of the event, however, as Spain’s Johann Mühlegg, a German émigré who obtained Spanish citizenship in 1999, dominated, taking the lead early, and winning by over two full minutes. Austrians Christian Hoffmann and Mikhail Botvinov, who had changed citizenship from Russia in 1996, finished second and third. At least the battle for the other medals was close, as Norwegian biathlon star Ole Einar Bjørndalen led the pack coming into the final lap, but was passed by the Austrians and Italian Pietro Piller Cottrer. Norway’s Kristen Skjeldal also passed Bjørndalen, who originally finished sixth. In the end, these five would battle out the medals over the final lap, with less than 13.5 seconds separating them, as Hoffmann outsprinted Botvinov to the line, winning by 1.3 seconds.
But two weeks later it would all change. On 23 February, Mühlegg won the 50 km, his third gold medal in Salt Lake City as he had also won the pursuit, only to fail his doping screen, testing positive for darbopoietin, an erythropoietin analogue. He lost the 50 km, and the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) ruled in December 2003 that he could be stripped of all three gold medals from the 2002 Winter Olympics. So the final standings eventually saw Hoffmann elevated to the gold medal, Botvinov the silver, and Skjeldal the bronze. As the FIS now changes the Winter Olympic program frequently, this was also the last 30 km race, at least for some time, as it was not held in 2006 or 2010, having first been contested at the Olympics in 1956.

All had different plans. Hackett was known for setting a suicidal pace and trying to hold on. Holland started slowly and would usually push the middle 500 metres, and then finish with what he had. Goodell would follow the leaders, relying in his faster speed to finish and try to win. Hackett took the lead on the first lap with Holland in his wake, expecting Hackett to go out fast and collapse from the effort. But what he didn’t know was that Hackett had changed his strategy and was setting a moderate pace, one he could maintain all day. At 800 metres, Hackett led in 8:03.50, well off the pace he had set at the US Trials. Holland only realized his mistake at 950 metres and took the lead, but it was far too late for him to drop his American rivals.
Goodell caught Hackett at 1,350 metres, who still trailed Holland by a bit. But Goodell took the lead at 1,400 metres and finished strongly to win the gold comfortably. In the final 100, Hackett came back and overtook Holland for the USA to finish 1-2. Goodell finished in the world record time of 15:02.40, with Hackett and Holland also both under the world mark.

His main competition was expected to come from his college roommate (at UCLA) and closest friend, Yang Chuan-Kwang of Taiwan, known to all as C. K. Yang. Yang had finished second to Johnson at the 1958 and 1960 AAU, and had won that event in 1959, in Johnson’s absence. Also competing was the 1954 bronze medalist, Vasily Kuznetsov, who had won the 1954 and 1958 European Championship, but was not considered at the same level as Johnson and Yang.
Yang won the first two events, the 100 and long jump, but Johnson moved ahead after the shot put. Johnson led at the end of the first day by 55 points. But Yang moved ahead in the 110 hurdles, only to see Johnson take back the lead for good in the seventh event, the discus throw. After nine events, Johnson led by 67 points, and Yang was a better 1,500 runner so the gold medal was still in doubt. Yang could win by defeating Johnson by about nine seconds in the 1,500. In the Roma darkness, Johnson ran the 1,500 by sticking right on Yang’s back and refusing to let him pull away, finishing only 1.2 seconds behind him and winning the gold medal. Kuznetsov repeated as bronze medalist, over 500 points behind Yang. Yang had bettered Johnson in seven of the ten events, but Johnson’s superiority in the throwing events – he won the shot, discus, and javelin – brought him the gold medal. This is often considered the greatest decathlon in Olympic history.

The 1976 European Champion, Hungary’s József Tuncsik, was also considered a medal challenger. But in round one, Minami faced France’s Yves Delvingt. The match was a defensive struggle but Delvingt’s victory was not in doubt at the end. Delvingt then lost to Italy’s Felice Mariani, which put Minami out of any chance of even a consolation bronze. The final came down to two unheralded judoka, Cuba’s Héctor Rodríguez and Korea’s Jang Eun-Gyeong. The final was described in one source as “complicated.” Rodríguez had the lead early, but twice countered with kosoto-gari. They then began to accrue penalties for passivity. Finally, Rodríguez went to the mat, appearing to injure his ribs. Bandaged by the Cuban doctor, he fought back to take the lead, and the match went the duration. At first, the referee mistakenly awarded the title to Jang, who jumped up in to the air in jubilation. But the mistake was quickly corrected, as Rodríguez won the first Cuban judo gold medal.

Since 2014, however, they had won three golds, two silvers and a bronze in the three World Championships, including a clean sweep in 2017 when Francesco Friedrich and Johannes Lochner shared the gold medal. Furthermore, they ended the 2017-18 World Cup season occupying the first three places with Lochner piloting the winning team, as the Germans came to the PyeongChang also occupying the top three world ranking places, with Lochner 1st, Friedrich 2nd, and Nico Walther 3rd.
Lochner, a nephew of the 1972 2-man silver medalist Rudi Lochner, won four of the seasons’ eight World Cup races, while runner-up Friedrich failed to register a win but, thanks to a consistent season-long campaign, was runner-up. Germany took the bronze medal after Walther and his crew won the final race of the season to snatch overall third place from Canada’s Justin Kripps by a single point.
The Latvian four of Oskars Melbardis, Daumants Dreiskens, Arvis Vilkaste and Janis Strenga were the surprise winners at Sochi in 2014, and defended their title in PyeongChang. Since their Olympic triumph, they had finished third at the 2015 World Championships, and won their first World title the following year. They came to the Games having finished fifth in the 2017-18 World Cup.
Friedrich was the joint gold medal winner in the 2-man bob event at PyeongChang and, following the German women’s success, was keen to make it three golds out of three for Germany at these Games. All three of their sleds set good times in official 4-man training, as did the local hero Won Yun-Jong. The fastest time in official training, however, was 49.07 by Benjamin Maier of Austria. That time was bettered on the very first run of heat one, however, as Won, despite being world ranked number 49, set the pace with a new track record 48.65.
The three Germans all followed each other in the first heat starting order. First to go was Johannes Lochner, and he moved into second place 0.3 seconds behind Won. Next to go was Friedrich, and he established yet another new track record 48.54 to take the lead. Walther slotted into third place with a 49.74 run, with Melbardis fourth and Canada’s Justin Kripps fifth, despite setting a new start record.
The two Germans, Friedrich and Walther, had the fastest two runs of heat two, with the former’s 49.01 being 0.15 faster than his compatriot. Switzerland’s Rico Peter also registered the same time as Walther, 49.16, but ended the day lying in joint fifth place. Won held on to second place overall after a 49.19, and Walther held on to third. Despite setting a start record 4.82 in heat one, and being joint fastest starter in heat two, Canada’s Justin Kripps let a great chance to move into a medal place slip away.
At the half-way stage, however, Kripps, the other 2-man joint gold medalist, was fourth, with three men, Lochner, Melbardis and Rico Peter, sharing fifth, 0.66 seconds behind the leader Friedrich, who was on track to make it two golds for him personally at the Games, and three for Germany. Friedrich was first to go in heat three and put in another great performance with the fastest run of the heat, 48.76 as he increased his lead over Won to 0.42s with Walter a further 7/100ths behind in third. Peter and Kripps shared fourth place but nearly 8/10ths behind the leader.
The track was running at its slowest in the fourth and final heat, with the ice temperature at -5.8C, the warmest of the event, as the field was cut from 29 to 20. Rico Peter registered the fastest run of the heat, but none of the contenders could match the consistency of Friedrich, whose 49.54 took the gold medal 0.53s ahead of Won Yun-Jong and Nico Walther, who shared the silver medal in the second tie for a bobsleigh medal of the Games. For Switzerland’s Peter, he had the consolation of finishing fourth but, sadly, it still maintained Switzerland’s 4-man medal drought going back to 2006. Despite setting a start record for the second time, Justin Kripps could only finish sixth overall in what was a disappointing event for him.
For Friedrich, and team-mates Candy Bauer, Martin Grothkopp and Thorsten Margis, they had the honour of leading Germany to the third and final bobsleigh gold of the Games, the first time since 2006 that one country had won all three golds at the same Games. Friedrich and Margis also became the first men since André Lange and Kevin Kuske at Turin 2006, to win the 2- and 4-man golds at the same Games, while Won Yun-Jong had the honour of piloting the first Asian crew to an Olympic bob medal. Pride and place, however, was reserved for Kevin Kuske, a member of the German silver-medal winning team, who became the most decorated Olympic bobsleigher of all time, with his sixth medal (four golds and two silvers), stretching back to 2002.

Her best placement in the Olympic season, however, was a sole second place at the Stavanger World Cup. Instead of Bergsma, Japan’s Miho Takagi - a bronze medalist at the 2017 Worlds - had won the first four races of the World Cup season. The Dutch had claimed the first four spots at the 2014 Games, and they fielded almost the same team. Due to the reduction in quota, only three skaters were allowed to go, and in the competitive Dutch Trials that meant that defending champion Jorien ter Mors did not qualify. That still left the 2010 champion and 2014 silver medallist Ireen Wüst, runner-up in the 2017 World Cup season Marrit Leenstra and 2014 bronze medallist Lotte van Beek.
Sprinter Nao Kodaira set a tough pace in the second pair, putting the target at 1:56.11. The first to contest that mark was Brittany Bowe. The 2015 world champion, she had suffered a concussion in training in 2016 and had required a long path to recovery. Her 1:55.54 took her to first place, albeit with all of the season’s best skaters still to come. Wüst, winner of the fifth World Cup in 2018, was the first of them. In her characteristic all-or-nothing style, she shattered Bowe’s mark by a full second (1:54.35). Leenstra mounted a serious attack in the following pair, but lost a full second in the final lap to end up in second with 1:55.26. Van Beek then attacked Leenstra’s time, and only missed it by 1/100 of a second. With one pair to go, this meant the Dutch were headed for another podium sweep, except that Takagi and Bergsma still had to skate. Bergsma had the second-fastest first half, but had lost her advantage to Wüst at the bell and faded to an 8th place finish. By contrast, Takagi had stuck to Wüst’s pace, and managed to stay quite close even in the final lap, ending up a close second with 1:54.55.
Next to her title, Wüst earned several records with her win. With 5 golds (10 total), she became the most successful Dutch Olympian of all time. She also became the first Winter Olympian to win gold at four consecutive Games, a record shared with Olympic greats Michael Phelps, Carl Lewis, Al Oerter, Ben Ainslie, Kaori Icho and Paul Elvstrøm.

The defending Olympic champions were Australia, but Duncan Free and the three-time Olympic champion Drew Ginn were not in London and the nation was not believed to be in contention for a medal. The only possible challengers to Murray and Bond were believed to be the Canadians Dave Calder and Scott Frandsen. They had been the silver medalists at the 2008 Olympics and had a strong year leading up to the 2012 Olympics, but even they stood little chance against the powerhouse of Murray and Bond.
The New Zealanders held back nothing in the heats, winning theirs with a world record time of 6:08.50. Canada made the finals but, during the earlier rounds, the stronger teams looked to be those from Italy and Great Britain. Italy had Niccolo Mornati and Lorenzo Carboncini, both distinguished rowers who had earned a bronze medal in the event at the most recent World Championships. Britain, meanwhile, had decided to prioritize the men’s four, knowing that they would be unable to beat Murray and Bond. Thus, although Pete Reed and Andrew Triggs-Hodge had been the silver medalists at the 2011 World Championships, they were sent to the men’s four and were replaced by the rookie pair of George Nash and William Satch.
In the final the French team of Germain Chardin and Dorian Mortelette, not previously believed to be a medal contender, came out in front and remained there for the first half of the course. Beyond that point, however, an incredible drive from Murray and Bond placed them out in front of the pack and, by 1500m, the race for gold was already over as the New Zealanders were around four boat lengths ahead of the competition. The final two spots were much tighter battle, between Italy, France, and Great Britain. The French duo managed an upset when they beat out both of the more heralded teams for the silver medal, leaving Great Britain with bronze. The Canadians finished a disappointing sixth and last.

In the normal course of affairs this would not be of any great note but in this case the significance came from its symbolism as the final breach of male exclusivity at the Summer Olympic Games. Boxing’s status as the only sport where women could not compete had ended by a decision of the AIBA in 2009.
At the London Games the gold medal winner was expected to come from a trio of women, world champion Ren Cancan of China, Great Britain’s Nicola Adams and Indian icon M. C. Mary Kom, with Adams having the twin advantages of being a natural flyweight, as opposed to the other two who had moved up from light-flyweight, and of fighting in front of a fiercely partisan crowd.  Whether it was those advantages that proved decisive or simply that Adams was the better fighter mattered little as she won three clear points decisions on her way to becoming the first ever female Olympic boxing champion. She put on a particularly impressive display against Ren in the final and scored a knockdown as she recorded a decisive 16-7 victory.
By winning the bronze Mary Kom became only the third Indian woman to win an Olympic medal. Widely feted in her home country as a five-time World Champion, the mother of twin sons even had a Bollywood movie made about her life.

Another contender was Michelle Smith of Ireland, who had placed second to Egerszegi at the 1995 European Championships, in addition to having won two gold medals at the meeting. History was not on Smith’s side as no Irish swimmer had ever won a race at the Olympic Games - let alone qualify for a final. Smith ended that streak by winning heat three and progressing as third fastest qualifier. The Irishwoman then went to win the final with comparative ease and finished three seconds ahead of Wagner with Egerszegi a close third.
Not only was Smith’s win the first by a Irish swimmer it was also the first time an Irish female Olympian had won any kind of medal in the history of the Games. Still there were many critics who saw her development from also-ran to world beater with a degree of suspicion. Smith had competed at two previous Olympics without ever getting past the heat stages and had only began achieving success after meeting Erik de Bruin, a Dutch discus thrower who was serving a ban for a doping violation, and her future husband.
Her supporters would point to the fact that de Bruin had revolutionized her training regime but there were always whispers that her performances were only achieved due to illegal methods. Smith won two more European titles in 1997, before her career came to a sudden halt in January 1998. In an out-of-competition drug test, she handed in a urine sample that had enough whiskey in it to kill a normal human being. This was considered enough evidence to convict her of tampering with the sample and she was banned for four years. After the ban ended she did not return to competition but instead qualified as a lawyer.

Four rider teams.  Best three scores in each round determined team total.  Separate competition.,na,"Germany, the champions in both Atlanta and Sydney, would enter this competition as marginal favourites but their domination of dressage was not mirrored in the jumping events. The German team had won the 2003 European Championships but France held the World Equestrian Games title and at least half the teams involved were expected to mount some sort of medal challenge.
The surprise of the first round was the poor performance of the French team, a serious injury to one of their horses in the middle of its round left them with only three team members to score. Placed ninth and distanced from the medal contenders, they opted to withdraw from the second phase. The first round ended with just four penalty points covering the first six teams with The Netherlands and USA sharing the lead on 8.00 faults. A single time penalty separated the leaders from the German team with Sweden, Switzerland and Belgium level on 12 faults in fourth.
The Swiss, Dutch and Belgians fell away in the second round leaving Germany, USA and Sweden to dispute the medal positions. Only four combinations achieved clear rounds in both phases of the event, Rolf-Göran Bengtsson of Sweden, the USA’s Beezie Madden and importantly, the German pair of Marco Kutscher and Ludger Beerbaum. With Germany counting Otto Becker’s four-faulter and discarding the round of Christian Ahlmann this left the team on a grand total of 13 faults and seven clear of the Swedes and Americans tied in second. A jump-off for silver between three nominated members of each team finished with all six riders performing faultless rounds but the total aggregated times revealed the US to be seven seconds faster and placed them ahead of Sweden.
For Beerbaum this was to be his sixth Olympic gold — or so it seemed. A few weeks after the Games the Fédération Équestre Internationale announced that Beerbaum’s horse Goldfever 3 had tested positive for the prohibited substance betamethasone. Beerbaum argued that the corticosteroid may have been present in an ointment given to the horse to treat a skin irritation, and whilst the FEI agreed that the substance provided no competitive advantage they were left with no alternative but to disqualify the pairing. Beerbaum later appealed to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) but they upheld the ruling of the FEI.
The United States were then upgraded to the gold medal position and Sweden to silver. Although Ludger Beerbaum’s record was expunged from the final results, Germany were not disqualified from the team event but had now to count the previous discarded scores from both rounds. This gave them a total of 21 penalties, which was still good enough for the bronze medal. The disqualification of Cian O’Connor meant that the Irish team, that had originally placed seventh, were removed from the official placings.

Thus, if a skater was ranked first by a majority of the judges, that skater was placed first overall for that section.  Ties were broken by a Subsequent Majority rule, i.e., if the skaters were ranked for the same position by the same number of judges, Majority Placement for the next higher position for each skater determined who was ranked higher.  Final placement was determined by factored placements.  The tiebreakers were then 1) Number of Majority Placements, 2) Total Ordinals of Majority, 3) Total Ordinals.  The placement for the Short Program was factored by 0.5 (33.3%), and the placement for Free Skating was factored by 1.0 (66.7%).  The sums of the factored placements were then used to determine final placement, with the Free Skating being the tiebreaker.",na,"Michelle Kwan had a chance to be on the 1994 US Olympic team but stepped aside to allow Nancy Kerrigan to compete, after she had been attacked just before the US Trials. By 1998 she was the top female skater in the world, having been the most consistent since the last Winter Olympics. She had won the 1996 World Championship, placed second in 1997, and would win again in 1998. Placing 15th at the 1996 Worlds was an American prodigy, Tara Lipinski, and in 1997, she shocked Kwan by defeating her at the US Nationals, and then again at the World Championships, winning that at only 14-years-old. But in the 1997-98 season, Kwan had re-established her supremacy, defeating Lipinski at Skate America and then won the US Trials with the performance of her life. In Nagano, Kwan started out strongly, winning the short program to give her the advantage going into the free skate. Kwan could win the gold medal either by winning the free skate, or by placing better than Lipinski, if third-placer Mariya Butyrskaya did not win the free program. In the free program, Kwan went first and skated a solid program. She received all 5.9s for artistic impression, but her technical scores of 5.7s and 5.8s left a little room for Lipinski. Lipinski skated last, landing seven clean triple jumps, as had Kwan. But she had two triple-triple combinations, and her increased technical difficulty brought her the gold medal. She received all scores of 5.8 and 5.9 and was placed first in the free program by seven of the nine judges, making her the youngest ever gold medalist in the event, two months younger than Sonja Henie had been in 1928. Lu Chen repeated her bronze medal performance from 1994. One athlete who was not present was Tanja Szewczenko of Germany, the 1994 World bronze medalist, who had to withdraw because of the flu.

Since the Vancouver Olympics his record had been unmatched in any winter sport as he had won 28 of the 36 World Cup and World Championship race. However he was not the reigning world champion, that honour held by Aleksandr Tretyakov, and it was thought that the Russian’s home track knowledge might be a major factor in Sochi.  Other contenders for the medals were Tomass Dukurs, elder brother to Martin, and American Matt Antoine.
It quickly became apparent that Martins Dukurs and Tretyakov were competing at a completely different level to the rest of the field but also that the Russian team’s intensive preparation on the track was yielding fine results. Tretyakov was over a quarter of a second faster than his rival on three of his four runs and the small margin the Latvian gained on the other run was insignificant to the final result.
With gold and silver long decided the attention turned to which of five sliders would take the bronze medal? John Daly appeared to be in prime position before the final run but his sled slipped out of the slider track on the push phase and his chances were instantly ruined. It was a fellow American who benefitted from Daly’s misfortune as Matt Antoine won his nation’s first medal in this event since 2002.
In May 2016 WADA (World Anti-Doping Agency) commissioned a report, the McLaren Report, to look into allegations of systematic Russian doping and a cover-up to avoid positives at the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics. The report was released in two parts, in July and December 2016, and confirmed the allegations. In 2017 the IOC formed a commission to investigate this, headed by IOC Member Denis Oswald, and usually referred to as the Oswald Commission. In late October 2017 the Oswald Commission began to release its findings.
On 22 November 2017 the gold medalist in this event, Aleksandr Tretyakov was disqualified based on findings from the Oswald Commission. Tretyakov immediately appealed this ruling to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS), and about 10 days before the PyeongChang Winter Olympics began, the CAS reached a decision and Tretyakov was exonerated and his gold medal was restored.

She also held the world record from 1975, until the GDR’s Barbara Krause broke it by over three sets at a meet in Berlin one month before the 1976 Olympics. But Krause would not be in Montréal, as she developed an infected throat and was dropped from the East German team. This seemingly left the race open for Babashoff, who did not count on Krause’s teammate Petra Thümer, who had finished second behind her in the world record swim. Thümer took the lead in the Montréal final from the start, and never let go. She opened a ½-second lead in the first 100 and maintained that throughout, eventually winning the gold medal in world record time of 4:09.89. Behind her, Babashoff also bettered Krause’s record, finishing in 4:10.46 but it was only for the silver medal. Five days later Thümer and Babashoff would also finish 1-2 in the 800 freestyle.
Babashoff was favored to win multiple golds in 1976, but ended up with four silvers and a freestyle relay upset gold. She was vocal in Montréal with her condemnation of the East German swimmers, accusing them of systematic doping and all looking like men. The press skewered Babashoff for these comments and called her a sore loser. But over 15 years later, after the fall of the Berlin Wall, and the re-unification of Germany, many of the East German sporting documents were leaked, and the entire GDR systematic doping plan was laid out for all to see, bringing Shirley Babashoff some measure of redemption. In 2000, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) awarded her the Olympic Order in Silver, perhaps as a token to admit she had been right all along.

The Finn, inspired by the support of the home crowd, boxed beautifully to reach the final where he faced Ireland’s first ever Olympic boxing finalist in the shape of Ulsterman John McNally.  The Hämäläinen-McNally fight was a clash of styles with the Finn, the shorter man, attempting to crowd the taller, more mobile Irishman. Although the decision in favour of Hämäläinen was hugely popular inside the arena the Irish team were convinced their man had been harshly treated by the judges who split 2-1 against McNally.
Hämäläinen returned to the Olympics in 1956 to win a bronze medal before embarking on a professional career which petered out quickly. The boxer that later went on to gain the most fame, albeit in a tragic way, was American Davey Moore. He may only have been a quarter-finalist in Helsinki but he went to a glittering career as a professional and had a four-year reign as world featherweight champion. In 1963 he defended his title on live television against Sugar Ramos of Mexico. In the 8th round he was knocked down and in the process of falling struck his head against the bottom rope and suffered a brain stem injury. He fought on for a few rounds before the referee stopped but later collapsed in his dressing room. Moore slipped into a coma and died a few days later.

In the final, Annus led from the outset, with 80.53 (264-2½) in round one, and 82.32 (270-1) in round two. In the third round, he improved to 83.19 (272-11¼), the best mark of the competition. Murofushi was second throughout, getting his best mark of 82.91 (272-0¼) in the final round, seeming to win the silver medal. Annus then passed his drug tests both before and after the competition, but after the disqualification of Róbert Fazekas from the discus, his training partner with whom he shared a coach, he was called back for another test. Annus was back in Hungary and refused to return for another test. Analysis of his samples revealed that they came from two different people and he was disqualified, the gold medal reverting to Murofushi.
And the doping story of this event did not end there. In 2012 the IOC re-tested the drug samples from the 2004 Olympics. Tikhon’s sample was found to have the presence of a methendienone metabolite, an anabolic steroid. This was announced before the London 2012 Olympics and he was not allowed to compete, but in December 2012 he was disqualified from the 2004 Olympics and his silver medal removed. It has been decided that no further medals would be upgraded in this event and thus, as of June 2021, the only medal awarded in the 2004 hammer throw was Murofushi’s gold medal.

Also dropping to the lower weight class was American Helen Maroulis, the 2015 World champion at 55 kg. She also won a World silver in 2012 and bronze in 2014, which was the last time she had been beaten. However, she was struggling to make the lower weight the entire year, but never gave up on her plan to stop the Yoshida machine. With the exception of Yoshida, Maroulis had beaten everyone else in the field, and was looking to take down the Japanese star, avenging her loss to her in the 2012 World Championships final, when she was pinned in four minutes.

En-route to the gold medal match Maroulis pinned World No.2 Mattsson in one semi-final, while Yoshida destroyed Betzabeth Argüello of Venezuela in the other.
The titanic showdown had so much on the line with Yoshida, a massive celebrity in Japan, as the reigning World champion at 53 kg; Maroulis was the reigning World champion at 55 kg. More importantly, Maroulis was seeking the first gold medal in women’s wrestling for the USA, while Yoshida was trying to become the second wrestler to ever win four Olympic gold medals, one day after her teammate Kaori Icho became the first.
In the gold medal match, Yoshida scored first, then the younger, stronger, confident and patient Maroulis, who had studied Yoshida for the past four years, scored a takedown on a twisting move, and took a 4-1 lead to capture the gold medal.

In February 1963, he had broken the supposedly unbreakable 15:46.6 world record of Knut Johannesen, set in winning the 1960 Winter Olympics gold medal. Johannesen was still formidable, having won the distance at the recent 1964 European Championships, and at the 1962 Europeans. But Nilsson had won the 10K at the 1962 and 1963 World Championships, and the 1963 European Championships. Nilsson was up in the first pair and he decided things early, posting 15:50.1, which would bring him the gold medal. When Johannesen, in the sixth pair, finishing in only 16:06.3, the battle for the gold appeared over. A few pairs later, Norwegian Fred Anton Maier, who had won a bronze medal two days before in the 5,000, came through with 16:06.0 which won him the silver medal, and pushed Johannesen back to the bronze. The first few pairs were contested without wind, but the wind was strong at the end of the event. The event was not without controversy. After Nilsson had skated, the Swedish referee, Sven Låftman, allowed ice preparation after each pair, but the machine used left the ice in very poor condition. The Norwegians complained about this but the Swedes said that Låftman was simply following the rules.
Nilsson would go on to win 10K races for several years, taking the distance at the 1965 European and World Championships, and the 1966 Europeans. He would set one more world record, but this one at 5,000 metres in 1965. Maier would repeat his silver medal in 1968 at Grenoble, and he would also win the distance in 1968 at the European and World Championships. But from 1966-68 he would also set the next four world records for the 10,000 m. Johannesen would win the 1964 World Championships a few weeks later, also winning the 5 and 10K at that meet, and he then retired. But his career had been a memorable one. At three Olympics he won five medals, two gold, two silver, and one bronze. He was all-around champion at the 1957 and 1964 World and the 1959-60 Europeans. A distance specialist, he won the 5,000 and 10,000 distances 11 times each at World and European Championships.

In truth it wasn’t quite the shock it appeared to be as Hungary’s domination had been superseded by Poland and the USSR in recent years.  The Hungarians were now regularly fighting for silver and bronze at the World Championships where 10 years earlier they had trounced all opposition.
The end for Hungary came even earlier than expected and not at the hands of either the Poles or Soviets. Instead it was Italy who, 40 years after inflicting Hungary’s previous Olympic defeat, won a quarter-final on a 9-7 score line.
Italy narrowly defeated France in the semis to set up a meeting with the USSR who had eliminated Poland in another closely fought match. 
Despite the best efforts of Wladimiro Calarese, who provided four victories to the Italian cause in the final, Italy fell 9-6 to the USSR.  Poland and France tied on 8 wins apiece in the bronze medal match with Poland taking third place 60-59 on hits.

In the final he took the lead on the first lap and would lead for most of the race. At the halfway point, the three Kenyans, Kiptanui, Joseph Keter, and Matthew Birir went clear and ran a team race throughout. At 2,000 metres they were joined by Italy’s Alessandro Lambruschini. On the final lap, Lambruschini could not keep up when Keter and Kiptanui powered ahead, Kiptanui leading to the last water jump. On the final straight, Keter ran down Kip to win the gold medal, with a stunning last lap of 59.4.

Germany’s Nicole Reinhardt was the reigning World Champion, having also carried the title in 2005, and had eight World Championship victories in various disciplines, as well as a gold medal from the K-4 500 event at the 2008 Summer Olympics. Reinhardt was injured before the London Games, however, and replaced by Katrin Wagner-Augustin, who had four Olympic and ten World Championship titles. Although these were mostly in K-4 events, she had been the Olympic bronze medalist in the K-1 500 four years earlier and was the reigning European Champion in the event. The traditionally strong Hungarian team had Danuta Kozák, who had five World Championship titles in K-2 and K-4 events, as well as silver from the K-4 500 event in Beijing, and had also won the K-1 500 at the 2011 European Championships.
Of all the kayakers, however, none were more heralded than Josefa Idem-Guerrini. At 47-years-old, Idem-Guerrini had first participated in the Olympic Games in 1984 when, competing for West Germany, she won a bronze medal in the K-2 500. In the K-1 500 she had an Olympic gold medal from 2000, in addition to silver from 2004 and 2008 and bronze from 1996, as well as 22 medals from the World Championship, five of which were gold and two of which (1990 and 2001) were from the K-1 500. In qualifying for the 2012 Summer Olympics, she became the first woman to compete at eight Olympics (in any sport), a continuous string from 1984.
The unpredictable nature of the event was evident right from beginning, as several of the less heralded kayakers finished quicker than the favorites, with Sofia Paldanius of Sweden posting the fastest time overall. Kozák earned the best time in the semi-finals, but Wagner-Augustin was surprisingly eliminated, ending her ability to continue the German dominance in canoeing at the 2012 Games. In the final, Osypenko-Radomska got off to a strong start and led for most of the race, but her strength began wane in the last stretch of the course. She was overtaken by Kozák, who won the gold medal handily, but still managed to earn silver after staving off Bridgitte Hartley of South Africa, who won the bronze. Hartley, whose only major international medal was bronze in the K-1 1000 at the 2009 World Championships, gave South Africa its first ever Olympic medal in canoeing; their previous best results had been seventh, earned by Ruth Nortje in the K-1 500 in 2000 and the women’s K-4 500 team in 2008. Idem-Guerrini finished fifth in her eighth and final Olympics, certainly not the result she had hoped for, but her longevity was an unparalleled accomplishment overall.

Competitors losing to the finalists entered repechage tournament for bronze medals.,na,"The favorites going into the men’s light-heavyweight Greco-Roman wrestling tournament were Hristo Marinov of Bulgaria, the 2010 World Champion, and Damian Janikowski of Poland, the 2011 World Championship silver medalist. Alim Selimov of Belarus was the reigning World Champion, a title he had held in 2005 as well, but was inconsistent on the world stage and not considered too dangerous in London. The tournament also had its share of Olympic veterans vying for the crown, including Egypt’s Karam Gaber, the 2004 Olympic champion in the heavyweight division, and Turkey’s Nazmi Avluca, who had made appearances at the 1996, 2000, and 2008 editions of the Games, the latter of which netted him a bronze medal.  Nonetheless, it was expected that Marinov and Janikowski would be the most serious challengers for the crown.
In the end it was not to be – Marinov, Selimau, and Avluca were all eliminated in their first bout, Avluca by Janikowski and Selimau by eventual finalist Alan Khugayev of Russia, runner-up at the most recent European Championships. Janikowski survived to the semi-finals, where he was defeated by Gaber, who went on to face Khugayev in the finals. Both rounds of the gold medal match went to par terre, with Khugayev emerging victorious after a successful defense, and then gut-wrench, of his Egyptian opponent.
In the first bronze medal match, Daniyal Gadzhiyev of Kazakhstan, a rookie wrestler who had managed to defeat Marinov in his first bout and Selimau in the repêchage, and Vladimer Gegeshidze of Georgia, an unusually tall competitor for his weight class who had not seen the podium in his two World Championships. They were evenly matched in their first two rounds, each successfully defending in the par terre, while, with points and cautions tied 90 seconds into the third round, Gadzhiyev drew the top and Gegeshidze the bottom in the final par terre. During the round, it seemed at first that the Georgian had won, scoring two points by converting his defense. The Kazakhs protested and, in a controversial decision, the referee’s call was overturned and Gadzhiyev was awarded the point and, consequently, the bronze medal. Gegeshidze, seemingly a fair sport at first, refused to shake hands with his opponent and attempted to exit the arena the wrong way, before kicking at the barricades and storming off. The second bronze medal match, between Janikowski and Mélonin Noumonvi, a three-time Olympian and runner-up at the 2009 World Championships, was far less dramatic, with Janikowski successfully defending in the first par terre and throwing his opponent out of the ring in the second to clinch the bronze.

Le Normand had taken a bad fall in the sprint quarter-final repêchages earlier in the day, and was taken to the hospital. The Australian team was Lionel Cox and Russell Mockridge, who had only ridden together once prior to the Olympics. But they were formidable – Mockridge won the kilometer time trial and Cox was silver medalist in the sprint. The Italian tandem was Cesare Pinarello and Antonio Maspes, also a very formidable team. Pinarello would place second in the sprint at the 1953 World Championships. Maspes turned professional in 1954 and won seven World Championships in the sprint – 1955-56, 1959-62, and 1964. In the semi, Pinarello and Maspes were no match for the Australians, but they won the bronze medal in a walkover, when France could again not come to the mark. The final was a virtual walkover for Cox and Mockridge, who easily won the race over South Africa for the gold medal.
Russell Mockridge turned professional late in 1953. He won several six-day races and managed to finish the 1955 Tour de France. He was unmatched in Australia, winning 12 consecutive national titles. In 1958 he was killed when struck by a bus while riding in the Tour of Gippsland race.

Theisen-Eaton’s story was intriguing as her husband, American Ashton Eaton, was the heavy favorite in the decathlon. A victory for both would make them the first ever husband-wife to win individual gold medals at the same Olympics, but for different nations.
Ennis-Hill took the early lead by winning the 100 hurdles, her best event. Johnson-Thompson then took over the lead by winning the high jump, clearing 1.98, a new heptathlon world best. Belgian Nafissatou Thiam, bronze medallist at the 2014 European Championships, won the shot put to take the lead. In the final event of the first day, Johnson-Thompson led the 200 with 23.26, followed by Ennis-Hill in 23.49.

Theisen-Eaton held on for bronze, while Johnson-Thompson struggled on the second day and dropped back to sixth. In keeping with the hyphenated motif, Latvian Laura Ikauniece-Admidina finished fourth.

When Britain did not lose a game, they won the gold medal, with Canada second. But the victory was not without controversy.
Bunny Ahearne, general secretary of the British Ice Hockey Federation in 1933, had obtained a complete list of all Canadian players who had been born in Britain. He was able to convince several of these to compete for Britain and these British-Canadians led Great Britain to the upset victory. The British-Canadians were:  Gordon Dailley from Winnipeg; Jimmy Chappell from Whitby, Ontario; Sandy Archer from Winnipeg; John “Gerry” Davey from Port Arthur, Ontario; Edgar “Chirp” Brenchley from Niagara Falls; and Archie Stinchcombe from Windsor.
Germany entered a team but failed to advance to the medal pool. Their best player was Rudi Ball, a Jew who had recently fled Germany because of the Anti-Semitic policies enacted by the Third Reich. He was convinced to return and compete for Germany in Garmisch-Partenkirchen and was the only Jewish member of the 1936 German Winter Olympic team.

The winner was a surprise as he usually lost a lot. The final swimmer finished in 4:21.8.

Of the two finalists, their only close match had come when Taymazov won his quarter-final against the American entrant, Kerry McCoy, but only after a review of the tapes when the Americans protested. The original score was 8-7 for Taymazov but the tape review revealed 2 more points for McCoy, but also 3 more for Taymazov, who thus won, 11-9. In the final Musulbes handled Taymazov comfortably, winning 5-2. Taymazov would return and win the gold medal at Athina in 2004.

In 2010 Wild had met Russian snowboarder Alyona Zavarzina, and they married in 2011. With the marriage Wild was able to apply for Russian citizenship and their federation was more than willing to support a medal contender, so Wild began competing for Russia in 2012.
The final came down to Wild against Swiss rider Nevin Galmarini. Galmarini won the first run but Wild’s margin on the second run gave him the gold medal, only a few minutes after his wife, Zavarzina, won a bronze medal in the women’s parallel giant slalom. Slovenian Žan Košir won the bronze medal race, defeating German Patrick Büssler. Many of the favorites crashed out early. The last three gold medals had been won by Philipp Schoch (SUI) in 2002-06 and Jasey Jay Anderson (CAN) in 2010 but they both went out in the 1/8th-finals. Two Austrian favorites also struggled as 2013 World Champion Benjamin Karl went out in the quarters, and 2013/14 World Cup leader Lukas Mathies did not make it past qualifying.
Wild thanked the Russian team for their support, noting that he did not speak Russian, and that many of his teammates helped him, stating, “I don’t think many of them like me, but I really appreciate it.”

This change in the program was certainly a much better solution for those skiers competing in both events.
The 18 km. race presented a strong field of merited skiers, all of them at their competitive peak. In Norway’s team Johan Grøttumsbraaten, the defending champion now aged 32, had shown new proof of his championship abilities by winning the World Championships at 18 km. in Oberhof, Germany 1931. Arne Rustadstuen was world champion on the distance in 1930, and Ole Stenen was World Champion in 50 km. from 1931 and had won the prestigious Holmenkollen the same year. Finland’s top skiers were Veli Saarinen, world champion at 18 km. in 1929 and Martti Lappalainen, winner in Holmenkollen 1928. Sweden’s Sven Utterström, now 30, had much cause for revenge after being ill during the 1928 Games. He was considered to be a 50 km. specialist, winning the World Championship 1930 and Holmenkollen in 1929 and 1930 over that distance.
The evening before the start of the race the weather was perfect for cross country skiing. But the next morning the temperature was rising, and that created problems preparing the skis for optimal gliding. In earlier competitions with mild weather the Swedes had shown great ability to choose the right ski-wax, and so they did this time. At an early stage of the race it was clear that this would be a great day for Sweden. Utterström commanded the race from start to finish, and won by a margin of exactly 2 minutes. The 24-year old Swede Axel Wikström surprised the experts by winning the silver medal 17 seconds ahead of Saarinen in 3rd place. Lappalainen was 4th, and the favored Norwegians were not satisfied with 5th and 6th place for Rustadstuen and Grøttumsbraaten, four minutes behind the winner.

Of the 2016 Olympic medallists only silver medallist Natalie Rooney returned for the Tokyo Games.
The qualification round was won by Rehák Štefečeková with a world record, as she became the first woman ever to record a perfect 125. Six shooters qualified for the final and, after the first 25 target shots, the lowest shooter was eliminated. After another 10 shots, and with only four shooters still competing, Alessandra Perilli and Laetisha Scanlan both had 26 hits and, as the tie breaker was the placement of the qualification round, Scanlan was eliminated, which gave Perilli a medal.

Perilli had already finished fourth in this event at the 2012 Games in London, then delivering the best Olympic result for her nation.

Both made it easily to the final where Gaudin defeated Buchard twice, both in the final pool, and in the medal pool barrage, earning him the gold medal. This made Gaudin one of only two Olympians, with Ramón Fonst (CUB) in 1904, to win both the individual foil and épée at the same Olympics. Buchard competed in 1932 and 1936, winning another silver medal in this event at Los Angeles, to go with team épée gold medals in 1924 and 1932. The bronze medal went to the United States’ George Calnan, a major upset in this era when American fencers were not usually competitive internationally. A career Naval officer, Calnan competed again in 1932 winning two team bronze medals. He died only a year later, in the crash of the airship USS Akron.
The format of this event was very unusual and has not been used in any other Olympics.  The first two rounds used the format that was customary at that time of large pools of fencers fencing one-touch bouts.  The third round (called the semi-finals) had two pools of nine fencers with the top five finishers from each pool advancing to the next round but the bouts were for two touches.  The next round was one pool of ten fencers fencing for two touches and was called a “Final Round” but then there was an additional round in which the top four fencers from the “Final Round” fenced in a direct-elimination Medal Round that they called an “Extra-Final.” The bouts in the Medal Round were for 10 touches but you had to win by two touches and so the Buchard-Calnan bout did not end until the score was 13-11. The first seed from the Final Round, Gaudin, fenced the fourth seed, Léon Tom, in one bout while the second and third seeds out of the final, Buchard and Calnan, fenced the other.  Then the winners of those two bouts (Gaudin / Buchard) fenced for gold and the losers (Calnan / Tom) fenced for bronze.

The USA woman had won a medal at every Olympics since 2004 and, with three gold and two bronzes, helped the United States be the only women’s team to medal at four consecutive Games. Their best chance in Tokyo was with the World Championships silver medallists Alix Klineman and April Ross, the second ranked pair in Tokyo, while the sixth ranked Kelly Claes and Sarah Sponcil were also US contenders. Brazil had not won the women’s title since the sport made its début at Atlanta in 1996, but they had a good chance of rectifying that in Tokyo with the third ranked Eduarda Lisboa (known as Duda) and Ágatha, the 2016 Rio silver medallist.
Since winning the 2019 Word Championship in Hamburg, the Canadian pair of Sarah Pavan and Melissa Humana-Paredes had put themselves in contention for a medal place in Tokyo, along with the German 2016 Olympic gold medallist Laura Ludwig and her new partner Margareta Kozuch. Ludwig returned to the sport in 2019 at the age of 33, after taking time off to have a baby. The Canadians were the topped ranked pair in Tokyo
The Czech par of Barbora Hermannová and Markéta Sluková were unable to play their pool matches because of COVID-19. The shock of the pool matches was the departure of the fancied Netherlands duo Sanne Keizer and Madelein Meppelink, who exited after three defeats, while the Brazilians Ana Patrícia and Rebecca Silva were expected to win their pool, but defeat by Claes and Sponcil in their final match meant they could only finish third after just one win, but they still made it through to the last 16. The closest pool match was that between Switzerland’s Nina Betschart and Tanja Hüberli and Germany’s Kozuch and Ludwig. The Swiss duo won 23-25, 22-20, 16-14.
Claes and Sponcil were eliminated in the last 16 by Canada’s Heather Bansley and Brandie Wilkerson, despite winning the first set. The two Brazil teams were in action on the opening day of the knockout competition. Ana Patrícia and Rebecca beat the highest ranked Chinese pair of Wang Fan and Xia Xinyi, and gold medal prospects Ágatha and Duda had a potentially mouth-watering game against Germany’s Kozuch and Ludwig. It turned out to be very close as the third ranked Brazilians lost by the narrowest of margins 21-19, 19-21, 16-14. On Duda’s 22nd birthday, she and Ágatha had match point at 14-13 in the tie-breaker, but the Germans won three-in-a-row to clinch it.
The all-Swiss clash between the tenth ranked Joana Heidrich and Anouk Vergé-Dépré and number seven ranked Betschart and Hüberli went to a deciding tie-breaker set, which was the longest of the match, and was won by Heidrich and Vergé-Dépré 23-21. With four teams seeded between 10 and 18 in the quarter-finals, it looked as though there could be a surprise winner of the women’s title.
April and Alix made themselves favourite for the gold medal after an impressive 21-19, 21-19 quarter-final win over Ludwig and Kozuch. Alix was a former indoor volleyball player who switched to beach to team up with April in late 2017. A place in the semi-final put April one step closer to the elusive gold to go with the silver she won in London 2012, and bronze at Rio in 2016. Going into the semi, their record was an impressive 5-0. Switzerland’s Heidrich and Vergé-Dépré caused a shock by beating the Brazilians Ana Patrícia and Rebecca, who had been struggling since qualifying from their pool in third place.
There were two Canadian pairs in the quarter-finals and the ninth ranked Bansley and Wilkerson came unstuck against Latvia’s Anastasija Kravčenoka and Tīna Graudiņa 15-12 in the deciding third set. The other Canadians, however, the top ranked Pavan and Melissa, were expected to go through to the last four but lost in three sets to the Australians Clancy and Artacho.
In the semi-final, the Australians won in two sets against the Latvians to become only the second Australian women to reach an Olympic final since Natalie Cook and Kerri-Ann Pottharst at Sydney in 2000. In the other semi-final, the American pair of April and Alix had an easy 21-12, 21-11 over the surprise semi-finalists Heidrich and Vergé-Dépré. For the first time in beach volleyball Olympic history, there was no Brazilian team in the semi-final of the women’s competition.
Switzerland won their first ever beach volleyball medal when Heidrich and Vergé-Dépré beat Kravčenoka and Graudiņa to take the bronze medal, while gold went to the favourites April and Alix, or the “A-team” as they had become known, who beat Clancy and Artacho 21-15, 21-16 in just 43 minutes. Victory gave the United States their fourth women’s gold medal in the last five Olympics, and it was 39-year-old April Ross’ third Olympic medal, but her first gold.

Canadian Horace “Lefty” Gwynne was another who impressed in the year before the Games and was the possessor of a vicious left hook that gave him his nickname. In the last eight Gwynne defeated Melis with surprising ease, dumping him on the canvas in the second round thanks to a right hook and generally punching him around the ring. If anything, his victory over José Luis Villanueva of the Philippines in the semi-finals was even more decisive, although Villanueva at least had the satisfaction of staying on his feet throughout. Ziglarski of Germany came through the other half of the draw, the American Joseph Lang losing out in the semi-final.
The much anticipated final turned out to be a mismatch, Gwynne won the first round and in the second produced a left-right combination that floored the German for a two-count. By the end of the third round, there was no doubt who was the victor and the Canadian, who had emerged as a favourite with fans, was credited with an overwhelming points victory. The legendary writer Damon Runyan, who was present at ringside, remarked “Of all the Olympic champions, I like this kid Gwynne the best”.
Gwynne’s English born father had returned to his native country to fight in World War I and it was there that Horace began boxing, fighting exhibitions with his brother to entertain British army troops when they were just four and six respectively. Turning professional after the Games, he had 40 pro fights and became Canadian bantamweight champion before the lack of big money fights for fighters in the lighter weights forced him into retirement. He later became a jockey’s agent where he earned himself another nickname, “10% Gwynne”; from the share he demanded from his clients earnings.

But the African boycott prevented him from competing, and deprived track fans of what would have been a great battle between him and Cuba’s Alberto Juantorena. Juantorena was known as a world class 400 m runner but had required surgery for a foot injury in 1975. As part of his rehabilitation he tested his endurance with a series of 800 m races in Spring 1976 that proved so successful that it was decided to add the 800 to his Olympic programme.
The other top 800 runner since 1972 was Rick Wohlhuter (USA) who had set two world records over 880 yards. Belgium’s Ivo Van Damme trailed only Wohlhuter on the 1976 year list prior to Montréal. The final included the three favorites and also the 1974 European Champion, Yugoslavia’s Luciano Sušanj. Sri Ram Singh (IND) set the pace in the final, going thru halfway in 50.85. Juantorena took the lead on the backstretch, with Wohlhuter on his shoulder. But Juantorena could not be had, his strength pulling him to a world record 1:43.50. This was Cuba’s first ever Olympic medal on the track. Wohlhuter faded slightly in the stretch and was passed by Van Damme for the silver medal.
After the Olympics Boit raced all the finalists in Europe, except Juantorena, and lost only one race. In December 1976 the track world was saddened to hear of the death of Ivo Van Damme in a car accident. In August 1977, Alberto Juantorena bettered his own world record with 1:43.4 in Sofia, Bulgaria. For the only time in Olympic history the 800 was run with a 2-turn stagger, so the athletes did not compete against each other closely until they had run 300 metres, making for some very dull races.

353784,"Platform, Men",2016 Summer Olympics,59,Diving,/editions/59/sports/DIV,19 – 20 August 2016,"Parque Aquático Maria Lenk, Parque Olímpico da Barra, Barra da Tijuca, Rio de Janeiro",28 from 18 countries,10 metre platform.,na,"There was some concern amongst British diving enthusiasts whether Tom Daley’s fame and subsequent television appearances would affect his performances since his bronze medal in 2012m but any worries those fans had were ill-founded as Daley finished third in the 2015 World Championship and won the newly instituted team gold medal with Rebecca Gallantree. He also won the European Championship 10-metre gold medal in 2016 and the 3-metre mixed synchronised gold, as well as the 2014 Commonwealth Games platform gold medal. Despite being just 22 years of age, Daley was competing in his third Olympics, and had an impressive record coming into the Games, having won 14 medals from the 16 events he had contested during the calendar year.
At the 2012 London Games, Daley finished third behind gold medal winner David Boudia of the USA and China’s Qiu Bo. Those two men also finished ahead of Daley at the 2015 World Championships, but this time Qiu Bo won gold and Boudia had to settle for silver, which was the same result in Barcelona two years earlier and was the fourth time the American had won a World Championship silver medal. But, having already won the 10-metre synchronised silver in Rio, Daley was one to beat, along with the two Chinese divers Qiu Bo and Chen Aisen.
In the preliminaries, it was Daley who gave an outstanding series of six dives and his total of 571.85 would have won the gold medal in Beijing and London. Daley’s worst dive was 88.00 whilst his best of 103.60 was the best of the day’s 168 dives. In total he received three 10s. The two Chinese divers were second and third best qualifiers while David Boudia was 75.40 points behind Daley in fourth.
If Daley’s qualifying dives were sensational, then his semi-final dives were disastrous as he finished last of the 18 divers and failed to make the final 12. He dived to near perfection the previous day; now he was more than 168 points behind his preliminary round total and three dives of just 54.00, 47.25 and 50.40 were not the dives of a champion. As expected Qiu Bo and Chen Aisen topped the semi-final scores with Chen 55.20 points ahead of his compatriot, after Qiu Bo’s disappointing 56.10 on his third dive. David Boudia only managed to qualify in tenth place after a final dive of 88.20. Mexico’s Iván Garcia qualified as third best and only 7.15 points behind Qui Bo.
As the scores did not carry forward the 12 finalists started on level terms and, true to form Chen Aisen, opened with a 96.90 with Qiu Bo close behind on 94.75. Disaster struck for Bo in his next dive, however, and was sent tumbling down the scoreboard with a 47.25. David Boudia took the lead ahead of Chen, but then Chinese diver showed his class with three dives in excess of 100, including a final dive of 108.00. The race was on for second place and Qiu Bo pulled himself back into medal contention with two dives of 102.00 or more, but then let it slip with a 47.50. It was left to America’s Boudia and another Mexican, Germán Sánchez, who had been diving consistently throughout the final, to decide which won silver and which won bronze. After a poor final dive from Boudia, Sanchez knew what he had to do on his final dive and he secured the silver medal with a 91.20, but was more than 52 points behind the champion Chen Aisen, with Qui Bo a disappointing sixth, despite getting a 10 from all seven judges for his third dive, a reverse  three and a half somersaults. This was the final event of the diving competition, and Aisen’s victory meant China had won seven of the eight gold medals on offer in Rio.

The defending champion was Australian Steph Rice, and she was back but was considered only a long shot for a medal. Rice led the field through the butterfly leg with the only sub-28 second split, but Ye moved ahead on the backstroke and Rice fell well back on the breaststroke leg. After 150 metres, the race was between Ye, Australian Alicia Coutts and American Caitlin Leverenz, but Ye was simply too strong for the others and pulled away to win in 2:07.57, with Coutts coming in second in 2:08.15. Leverenz was third, just ahead of Rice, equaling her result in both IMs from the 2010 Pan-Pacs. Ye’s time was an all-time textile best and an Olympic record.
Ye became the sixth swimmer to double in the 200/400 IM, and the fifth in a row. This had been done previously by Claudia Kolb (USA) in 1968, and since 1996, consecutively by Michelle Smith (IRL), Yana Klochkova (UKR) (2000-04), and Rice in 2008. Ye’s two gold medals while still only 16-years-old made her the first to do that since Diana Mocanu (ROU) in 2000.

Heading in, it was generally considered that four time world champion, Hawaiian-born Carissa Moore of the United States, was going to be hard to beat. Her main challenger was expected to be fellow American, Caroline Marks, a young phenom, who at the age of 15 in 2017 became the youngest surfer to qualify for the Women’s Championship Tour, and currently sat in sixth place in the World Surf League’s rankings. Australia was also expected to mount a medal challenge with sentimental favourite, Stephanie Gilmore, seven-time world champion, and another veteran, Sally Fitzgibbons, who earlier in her career had been runner up three years in succession for the world title, and more recently had claimed victory at the 2021 International Surfing Association’s World Surfing Games.
As the competition unfolded, two relatively unheralded surfers began to emerge as medal contenders. One was Bianca Buitendag of South Africa, who in recent years had seen her World Surf League ranking slip to 44th, but who qualified for the Olympics with her strong performance at the 2019 International Surfing Association’s World Surfing Games. The other was the host country’s Amuro Tsuzuki, winner of the World Surf League’s Junior Championship in 2019. In Round 3, Buitendag took down veteran Stephanie Gilmore, and after advancing through the quarterfinals, defeated another of the favourites, Caroline Marks, in the semifinals to advance to the gold medal match, assuring South Africa of a silver medal. For her part, Tsuzuki sailed into the quarterfinals where she faced Australia’s Fitzgibbons, a formidable opponent. After emerging victorious, her next challenge was the top favourite, Carissa Moore, who she lost to by a narrow margin, ending her gold medal hopes. Her Olympics did end on a happy note, though, as she defeated the American, Marks, for the bronze medal. Meanwhile, in the gold medal match, between Moore and the surprising Buitendag, the American, as expected, won in relatively comfortable fashion, affirming her status as the current premier female surfer.

Oyakawa recorded the fastest times at all stages of the competition and broke the Olympic record, which had stood since 1936, in both semi-final and final. A minor piece of history occurred in heat 5 of the first round when the Soviet Union’s Leonid Sagayduk  raced against the sole Chinese competitor in Helsinki, Wu Chuanyu. The rest of the Chinese team had been stranded in Leningrad due to a visa problem and were unable to reach Helsinki. It was not until thirty-six years later in Seoul that competitors from these two countries would meet again at a Summer Olympics.

Britain’s Paula Radcliffe, the world-record holder, had gamely hung on early, but injuries had her well below her best and she barely finished, placing 23rd.

The dominant female slalom skier in the last years was Mikaela Shiffrin. The defending champion in the event from Sochi, she had won four out of the last five slalom World Cups (2012/13-2014/15 and 2016/17) and the last three World Championships slalom (2013, 2015 and 2017), losing only the 2015/16 slalom Crystal Globe to Frida Hansdotter, a season in which Shiffrin struggled with injuries. The current standings in the slalom World Cup also saw Shiffrin well in the lead as she won in Killington, Lienz, Zagreb, Kranjska Gora and Flachau, and additionally won the parallel slaom in Courchevel and the city parallel event in Oslo. In second place, with two season wins in Levi and Lenzerheide, which was the last race before the Olympics, was Petra Vlhová, followed by Hansdotter, silver medalist at the 2015 Worlds and bronze medalist at the 2017 Worlds, in third, and Wendy Holdener, silver medalist at the 2017 Worlds, in fourth. The silver medalist from Sochi, Marlies Schild, now Raich, retired shortly thereafter and the bronze medalist Kathrin Zettel retired in 2015.
The first run saw Holdener in the lead with Hansdotter only 1/10th of a second behind. Unexpectedly in third position was Anna Swenn-Larsson with Shiffrin “only” in fourth place, 0.48 seconds behind Holdener. Vlhová had even more problems, finishing only 12th and more than 1.2 seconds behind. In the second run, young Austrian Katharina Gallhuber, whose best World Cup finish was a shared fifth place in the Stockholm city event almost a month before the Games, skied the race of her life, posting the best run time. This put her in the lead and when Haver-Løseth, Shiffrin and Swenn-Larsson all were not able to beat Gallhuber’s overall time, she was on the podium winning a surprising medal.
At the end it was bronze for her with Hansdotter winning gold and Holdener only 0.05 seconds behind taking silver, finishing in second place, as she did so often. Shiffrin missing the podium was one of the biggest upsets of the PyeongChang Olympics. Finishing in seventh place was Bernadette Schild, who had an incredible second run and led until the last intermediate time before she slipped just before the last flat part of the course and had to take some gates from the wrong side, which cost her speed. Hansdotter won gold using Rossignol skis, Holdener used Head, and Gallhuber skied on Atomic.

Louganis’s ninth dive was a reverse 2½ pike and as he exited the pike into layout, preparing for the entry, he struck his head on the springboard. He collapsed into the water, earned only a total score of 6.30 for the dive, dropping him back to fifth place, and it was not certain he could continue. Before the 10th dive he received several stitches from US team doctor James Puffer. He came back on dive 10, a reverse 2½ with 3½ twists, and received scores between 8.0 and 9.5. He moved up further on the final dive, placing third in qualifying, with Tan placing first. Tan had played Alydar to Louganis’s Affirmed over the years, but he had beaten him twice earlier in 1988 and was looking for gold in Seoul.
But it was not to be. Louganis led most of the finals, except after the fourth dive, when he briefly dropped behind with a poor dive. But he regained the lead after round five, and held it for the gold medal, winning by almost 26 points. His ninth dive was a reprise of his reverse 2½ pike which he performed well, scoring 8.5s from all judges. Tan had to settle for a silver medal repeat, and in 1992 he would three-peat with a third silver on springboard. Tan also won silver on springboard at the 1986 and 1991 World Championships, having the poor timing to compete in the same era as Greg Louganis.
More drama occurred over the next few years. In 1995, Louganis came out as gay, which had been suspected, and also revealed that he was HIV-positive, and had been so at the time of the Seoul Olympics. Only a few people knew this at the time, including his coach, Ron O’Brien, but Dr. James Puffer did not. Louganis had been concerned that his head injury in Seoul had possibly contaminated the water and risked infecting other divers, although the dilution by the water, and the chlorine in the water, obviated that possibility. Both O’Brien and Puffer tested negative for HIV.
A few days later, Louganis would win the platform gold medal, completing the diving double-double, to replicate the feat of Pat McCormick from 1952-56.

The entire Russian team was outstanding at the 2015 World Championships, winning eight of the nine gold medals, with Nataliya Ishchenko and Svetlana Romashina winning seven golds between them. The pair had been dominant in the event since the 2005 World Championships in Montreal, winning six Olympic and a massive 60 World and European gold medals between them. China’s Huang Xuechen and Sun Wenyan were runners-up to the Russian girls in the two duet events at the 2015 Worlds and were probably the only pair to offer a serious challenge for the Rio gold medal.
True to form, the defending champions Ishchenko and Romashina set the pace with a near perfect performance in the free routine with three 9.9s in a combined score of 98.0667 and a clear two points ahead of Huang and Sun, with the Japanese pair of Risako Mitsui and Yukiko Inui in third and the Spanish pair of Ona Carbonell (bronze medallist at London 2012) and Gemma Mengual fourth. Mengual came out of retirement at the age of 39 to compete in Rio and try and win Spain’s only synchronised swimming medal, because they did not have a squad in the team event, despite winning the bronze medal at London in 2012. The Russians increased their lead after the second day’s technical programme with their “Gypsy Dancer” routine which gave them 96.4577 and extended their lead from 2 to 3.0899 points ahead of the Chinese pair with Inui and Mitsui still third as the field was cut to the final 12.
Of the three front runners Ishchenko and Romashina were the first to perform the final free routine and their 98.533 gave them a final total of 194.9910. With five pairs still to go, their performance was already hailed as the gold-medal winning one. Huang and Sun held on to their silver, maintaining their bronze medal position a full 6.9363 behind the gold medal winners. The Ukrainian girls Lolita Ananasova and Anna Voloshyna overtook the Spaniards Carbonell and Mengual to finish fourth. It was the fifth consecutive gold for a Russian pair and, for Ishchenko and Romashina, it was their second gold as they joined Russians Anastasiya Davydova and Anastasiya Yermakova with two duet gold medals.

Competitors losing to the finalists entered repechage tournament for bronze medals.,na,"There was only one favorite in the women’s middleweight freestyle wrestling event at the 2012 Summer Olympics: Kaori Icho of Japan. Aside from a forfeit at the 2007 Asian Championships, the Japanese wrestler had won her last 149 matches, held the only two Olympic crowns in the event (2004 and 2008), and was a seven-time World Champion, having won the event in every tournament since 2002, with the exception of the oddly-held 2008 edition and 2009, when she had taken a break from wrestling. No other competitor came close to matching her dominance. She breezed through the tournament to meet Jing Ruixue of China in the final, who had been World Champion in the non-Olympic 67 kg division in 2006 and 2007, runner-up in the middleweight in 2005, and a bronze medalist at the most recent edition. The battle for the crown was almost no contest: Icho had the first round won by the first thirty seconds, having already scored three points on Jing. In the second period, Icho reversed a near-takedown by the leg to score one point and scored another in the final twenty seconds, giving Japan both wrestling medals of the day, following Hitomi Obara’s earlier victory in the flyweight division.
The bronze medal matches were somewhat less one-sided. Canadian Martine Dugrenier, thrice World Champion (2008, 2009, and 2010) and thrice runner-up (2005, 2006, 2007) in the 67 kg category, fought in her second Olympics as a middleweight competitor, but had the misfortune of drawing against Icho in the first round. In the battle for the bronze medal she put up a good fight against Soronzonboldyn Battsetseg of Mongolia, the 2010 World Champion in the 59 kg class (also non-Olympic), but was unable to match her opponent’s skill or score any points, losing 0-2 and 0-1 and giving Mongolia its first Olympic medal in wrestling since 1980. The battle for the final podium spot was perhaps the most hard fought, pitting Monika Michalik of Poland, twice bronze-medalist at the World Championships (2006 and 2007) and thrice gold medalist at the European Championships (2003 in the 59 kg division, 2005, 2009), against Lyubov Volosova of Russia, three-time World Championship runner-up (2001 in the 56 kg class, 2008, 2009) and once bronze medalist (2010) and twice European Champion (2006 at 56 kg, 2010). The first round went to par terre, where Michalik drew the advantaged position and scored on her opponent. Volosova had her revenge, however, outscoring the Polish wrestler in the second period 3-1 and converting the advantage in a third-round par terre to win the bronze.

The stage was set for the three women to produce an epic race in Melbourne but it would not fully take place as Gastelaars was a victim of the Dutch boycott of the 1956 Games.
In the absence of the Dutchwoman the event turned into a bonanza for the host nation of Australia.
As expected, Fraser and Crapp contested the gold medal with the pair forcing each other to go faster than they’d ever gone before in pursuit of the title. Both swam inside the existing world record but it was Fraser who was crowned Olympic champion. Faith Leech, at only 15 years of age, completed an Australian sweep of the medals, which matched what happened in the men’s equivalent race 24 hours earlier.

The early favorite was C. K. Yang who had won the 1960 silver medal behind Rafer Johnson. But the event was in turmoil in 1964. In 1962, the pole vault was being converted to a fiberglass pole and the new heights achieved made pole vault points well out of proportion to the other events. Yang was a top pole vaulter and at the 1963 Mt. Sac Relays he shattered the world record with 9,121 points, breaking the record after only nine events, and clearing 4.84 [15-10½) in the vault in the process. Yang would later clear 5 metres [16-4¾) in the vault. The problem with the vault led officials to change the scoring tables the year before the Tokyo Olympics, which took away much of Yang’s dominance over the field. After that change, there was no clear favorite in Tokyo. Vasily Kuznetsov of the USSR had won the European Championships in 1954, 1958, and 1962, and had won bronze medals in both 1956 and 1960.

At the first Norwegian selection races Brusveen was not at his best, but showed better form in the last race when placing fourth in the Norwegian Championships in 15km, only 11 seconds behind the winner Brenden. The Norwegian Olympic Committee selected seven cross country skiers for Squaw Valley. Brusveen was appointed as a substitute who should stay at home in Norway, to Brusveen’s great disappointment and loud protests in the Norwegian media.  An extra selection race over 12 km was decided, only two days before the team should leave for Squaw Valley. Brusveen showed superior form and won, over 40 seconds ahead of double Olympic champion Hallgeir Brenden. The sports enthusiast King Olav V told the NOC that he would like to see Brusveen in the Olympics, and the decision was changed. Brusveen, aged 33, and having already decided that 1960 would be his last season, travelled to the US one the day after the main team had left Oslo.
The 15 km race took place four days after the 30 km race, which ended with another disappointment for the Norwegians, Brenden as their best, placing only ninth. Brusveen was then selected for the 15km team, starting with number 20 out of 54 competitors. After 5 km it looked to be another great day for Sweden. Janne Stefansson was in the lead, three seconds ahead of Sixten Jernberg, with Rolf Rämgård another four seconds behind. It was very close, Gennady Vaganov following only one second behind Rämgård, and with Brusveen in sixth place, still in contention for a medal, 17 seconds behind the leader.  At 10 km things had changed. Jernberg was now in the lead, but only two seconds ahead of fast charging Brusveen and Veikko Hakulinen, the Finn showing better form than in the 30 km. Stefansson was down in fourth place, 16 seconds behind.
The final stage of the race developed into a real thriller. Brusveen was first to finish of the medal favorites. He finished his race in excellent style and bettered Stefansson’s leading time by more than 50 seconds. Hakulinen could not respond to Brusveen’s finishing speed. The last challenger was Jernberg.

From 1952 the one-person dinghy, or monotype class, would become the Finn class at the Olympics.
Paul Evlstrøm, a 20-year-old Dane, started his Olympic career rather inauspiciously when he did not finish the first race. He placed only sixth in the second race, but improved gradually. He was in only eighth place after five races, but won the final two races to win the gold medal. After six races, the leader was American Ralph Evans, but when he finished only fifth in the final race, he dropped down to the silver medal. The fourth-place finisher, Rickard Sarby, later designed the Finn, which replaced the Firefly at the Olympics, and became the standard class for one-person dinghy.
For Elvstrøm, this was the first appearance of what would be a 40-year Olympic career, finishing only in 1988. He competed in eight Olympics, but is best known for winning the one-person dinghy at four consecutive Olympics – 1948-60.

The bronze medal looked to be Chen’s coming into the final dive. She had a 16.47 lead over Soviet Anzhela Stasyulevich, with American Wendy Lian Williams fifth, over 28 points behind. But Chen went way over on a back 3½ tuck, scoring only 2s and 3s, giving the bronze medal to Williams, who received all 8s on an inward 2½ pike on her final effort. Williams would win another bronze at the 1991 World Championships but never made another Olympic team.

Thus, one had to throw not only long, but accurately. The event was contested from a 2.50 metre square, rather than a circular ring which later became standard.
It has been said that defending champion Bob Garrett’s biggest problem was that he kept hitting the trees with his throws.  Hungary’s Rudolf Bauer recorded 36.04 metres in qualifying and, although he could do no better on Sunday, it held up as the winning throw.

A serious crash by Yuliya Livinskaya during the first heat of the 1/8 final placed the event on hold for some time, while a later one by David during the 1/4 final placed her out of contention for a medal. Then, in a somewhat surprising turn, both Selwa and Holmlund, who were in the same heat, failed to advance to the final round, placing third and fourth respectively.

Beňuš had won 13 gold medals at the European and World Championships in the C-1 team, was the 2011 C-1 World bronze medallist, and had earned silver in the C-1 at the 2010 Europeans and bronze in the 2013 and 2015 editions.

The best qualifier was Simon Martirosyan, the world record holder in total with 435 kg. He was also the 2018 and 2019 world champion, and 2019 European champion, but he missed a valid attempt in clean & jerk at the European Championships in April 2021 and was placed last. The season’s best lifter was Ruslan Nurudinov, who won the Asian championships in April 2021 with a new world record in clean & jerk (241 kg) and a total of 429 kg. After his samples from the 2012 London Games had been re-tested, they revealed doping and he was suspended for two years from December 2018. He was therefore prevented from qualifying for Tokyo as it was required to compete in at least one event in each of the three qualifying periods. As Yang Zhe was not selected for the Chinese team, because only four male athletes per nation were allowed to compete, it meant the world record holder in snatch with 200 kg, achieved at the Asian championships in April 2021, was also not present in Tokyo. This meant Akbar Djuraev was the season best qualifier with 428 kg, set on the way to winning silver at the last Asian championships. Behind Martirosyan and Djuraev, the field was wide open as numerous athletes had performed on almost the same level. They were Timur Naniyev, the only male weightlifter for the Russian Olympic Committee competing in Tokyo, with a qualification best of 409 kg, Hristo Hristov, season best 406 kg, or Ali Hashemi and Artūrs Plēsnieks, both with qualification bests of 405 kg.
The snatch element did not create any surprises as Martirosyan lifted 195 kg and Djuraev 193 kg, followed by Hristov 189 kg, Naniyev 188 kg, and Hashemi 184 kg, while Plēsnieks and Jin Yun-Seong cleared 180 kg. These results indicated what was to come in the rest of the competition. As expected, the clean & jerk element was also close for all three medal positions from early on. Hristov lifted 219 kg in his second attempt, while Naniyev lifted 221 kg and Plēsnieks cleared 225 kg in their second lifts, which gave Naniyev the lead with 409 kg, followed by Hristov on 408 kg and Plēsnieks on 405 kg. Naniyev, Hristov, and Jin all failed to improve their totals while Hashemi failed to clear any weight, but Plēsnieks came from behind and lifted a personal best 230 kg for a total of 410 kg to get into the bronze medal position. The race for gold was started by Djuraev who cleared 227 kg with his first attempt, which was answered with a 228 kg by Martirosyan. After Djuraev failed to lift 234 kg, Martirosyan tried to put pressure on the young Uzbek as he increased the weight so that Djuraev had to lift again immediately, but this went wrong when Djuraev cleared 237 kg in his last attempt. Martirosyan had to go for 238 kg, three kilograms more than needed for gold, but he failed both lifts and won a second successive silver medal.
The Olympic Standard for Olympic records was 193 kg for snatch, 231 kg for clean & jerk, and 419 kg for total. Martirosyan set an Olympic record in snatch with 195 kg while Djuraev set a record in clean & jerk with 237 kg and he then set the in total record with 420 kg, until bettered by Martirosyan with 423 kg, but Djuraev got it back after lifting 430 kg.

East Germany, the defending Olympic champion, was not expected to be among the medal contenders, with only Carola Anding left from their 1980 gold winning team. The Soviet Union, silver medalists at the 1980 Olympics and the 1982 World Championships, missed their cross-country queen Galina Kulakova, who had ended her glorious career at age 39, after winning a World silver medal with the 1982 team.
After the first leg, Norway had a big lead, Inger Helene Nybråten coming to the first exchange 25 seconds ahead of the Soviet Union’s Yuliya Stepanova. More than ten seconds further behind followed Finland, Czechoslovakia, Switzerland and Sweden. On the second leg, Anne Jahren extended Norway’s lead to almost one minute, with the USSR still second, with Czechoslovakia and Finland close behind. When Brit Pettersen sent Berit Aunli out on the anchor leg, Soviet’s Nadezhda Buryakova was 1:03 behind, with Finland and Czechoslovakia ten seconds further behind. Aunli anchored Norway to a clear victory, but the fight for the other medals were very tight. The Soviet Union’s Raisa Smetanina was soon overtaken by Marja-Liisa Hämälainen from Finland and Czechoslovakia’s Květa Jeriová, and to everyone’s surprise the Czech skiier outsprinted the double Olympic champion Hämälainen in a close duel for silver. The Czechoslovakian team celebrated their first ever Olympic relay medal.

Since teaming up, Daley and Goodfellow had finished third in the 2016 World Cup and were silver medalists at the European Championships. The pair had podium finishes in all synchronised events they contested leading up to the Olympics in 2016, and were considered medal candidates in Rio, but to capture gold, the British pair, and the other six pairs, would have to be at their very best to beat the Chinese pair of Chen Aisen and Lin Yue, the 2015 World Champions and 2016 World Cup winners. As it turned out, the Chinese duo were so outstanding that, after the first dive, they took the lead and never lost it, winning by 39.87 points, helped by a wonderful fifth dive which saw them score 106.56 points. In total they received five maximums.
After two dives it was clear that the United States were going to be the nearest challengers, but it was a close battle between Great Britain, Germany, Mexico, Ukraine and Russia for the bronze medal. After three dives, only a couple of points separated those five countries. Germany moved into third place after round four while Britain slipped to fifth place, but they moved back to third after their penultimate dive when they emulated the dive that netted Chen and Lin their 106.56 and, whilst not to the same high standard of the Chinese duo, Daley and Goodfellow managed 92.13. With one round to go, and the last to dive, the British pair knew what they had to do to take bronze and they did it with over six points to spare. There was only one team in it from the start, however, and Lin Yue added another gold to the one he won in the synchronised 3-metre event at Beijing in 2008.

In the semis, three races were again contested, with the top four riders in each heat advancing based on points. The final was a single race, over the 350 metre course.
The favorite was Latvian World Champion Maris Strombergs. Strombergs placed first in both his quarter and semi, to gain the coveted #1 gate slot for the start of the final.

But she elected not to contest this race in Salt Lake City, which left the event open.
The early leader in the race was Russian Yuliya Chepalova, but by 9 km, Italy’s Stefania Belmondo, the 1999 World Champion in the event, moved ahead, until her pole broke at 10.5 km. She dropped back to 10th place, but fortunately trailed the leader, Larisa Lazutina, by only 10 seconds. Belmondo was given a pole by a French official but it was very long, so she struggled for over 500 metres until an Italian coach gave her one of her own poles. She then powered ahead, caught Lazutina and won a narrow victory by 1.8 seconds. Behind them, Czech skier Kateřina Neumannová came in for the bronze medal. But Lazutina would not keep her silver medal. After the pursuit race, held six days later, she was found to have tested positive for darpopoietin, an erythropoietin analogue, and was disqualified in late 2003. Neumannová was moved up to silver, and Chepalova would get the bronze. At the 2003 World Championships, the event was won by the woman who wasn’t there, Bente Skari-Martinsen.

Nobody else was really close.  On Saturday, the 18th, Queenie Newall scored well, leading the archers that day with 350 points but by a slim margin, as Beatrice Hill-Lowe was 2nd on the day with 343.  Lottie Dod collapsed completely on the second day, scoring only 294, which trailed five other archers.
Sybil Fenton “Queenie” Newall’s victory still allows her the claim of being the oldest woman to win an Olympic medal or gold medal - she was 4 months short of her 54th birthday during the archery event.  Newall won the British championship in archery in both 1911 and 1912 but she was far from the top female shooter of the era.  That honor falls to Alice Legh, the greatest British archer ever, who won 23 national championships between 1886 and 1922.  Legh elected not to compete at the Olympic event, which she almost certainly would have won.  The following week at Oxford, she defeated Newall by 151 points.
The runner-up, Lottie Dod, who was the sister of the men’s 1908 Olympic champion William Dod, never won a British title in archery.  But she is certainly the greatest all-around British sportswoman.  She remains the youngest ever champion at Wimbledon, having won the ladies’ singles in 1887 aged only 15.  It was her first of five Wimbledon singles’ titles, but she retired from tennis in 1893 and turned to other sports.  She played hockey (field) for England in 1899-1900 and in golf, won the British Ladies’ Amateur Championship in 1904, after reaching the semi-finals in 1898 and 1899.

A third round meeting paired two of the favourites together with Boris Kuznetzov, who had upset 1968 champion Valerian Sokolov to make the Soviet team, emerging victorious over Ryszard Tomczyk, the European champion from Poland. The most experienced boxer in the competition was Philip Waruinge of Kenya who was making his third Olympic appearance. As Kuznetzov made his way through the bottom half of the draw so Waruinge did likewise in the top half of the draw. Their meeting in the final proved to be the most contentious of the entire tournament and the announcement of the Soviet boxer’s victory by a 3-2 decision brought whistling, booing and shouts of “Schieber“ (fix) from the crowd inside the arena. Willi Hoepner (1923-1978), the Kenyan’s team West German coach, commented “The decision against Waruinge was a scandal. It was the East German judge that robbed us.“

He invented the Olympic cross, a variant of the iron cross, in which the gymnast is stationary on the rings with his arms outstretched at shoulder height. In the Olympic cross, the gymnast twists first to one side then the other. It originated at the 1953 Soviet Championships when Russian judges told the Armenian coach their gymnasts were not holding their crosses long enough. Azaryan went into an iron cross, then turned to the judges on one side, asking, “Is this long enough?” and then repeated the maneuver to opposite side.
This event was fully dominated by the Soviet Union and Japan who filled the first eight places, with five Japanese and three Soviets. Silver went to Soviet Valentin Muratov while the bronze was won by Masami Kubota. Kubota also won apparatus bronze medals on the parallel bars and horizontal bar, while Muratov won apparatus golds on the vault and floor exercise. Azaryan’s son, Eduard, would compete in gymnastics at the 1980 Olympics.

None of the medallists from Rio returned to Tokyo; furthermore, of the eight finalists from Rio, only Snježana Pejčić competed again in Tokyo. Not present in Tokyo was the reigning 2018 World Champion Im Ha-Na, and the other medallists from this event at the Worlds also did not participate. All three medallists, Océanne Muller (gold), Jessie Kaps (silver) and Sofia Ceccarello (bronze) from the 2021 European Shooting Championships, however, held only about two months before the Tokyo Games, did compete.

Both the qualification round, increased from 40 to 60 shots, and the final round, from a maximum of 20 to 24 shots, saw a change of format since Rio 2016. The qualification round was topped by Jeanette Hegg Duestad, who finally finished fourth, followed by Park Hui-Mun and Mary Tucker. The final was very close from the beginning. After the first ten shots, the first five shooters were separated by only 0.6 points. The gold medal decision came in the very last shot. Anastasiya Galashina was 0.2 points ahead of Yang Qian, but Yang produced her poorest shot during the entire competition with a 9.8, and Galashina also had her worst shot, scoring only 8.9 and finally the lead changed again in favor of the Chinese. As Nina Christen finished third, the three medallists all came from the last three shooters that qualified for the final round.
With Houda Chaabi this competition also saw the first ever female shooter participating for Algeria, while Kanykei Kubanychbekova became the first ever female shooter for Kyrgyzstan.

Latynina would win the silver medal in this event at the 1964 Olympics, with Astakhova repeating as bronze medalist.
Latynina won six Olympic medals in Rome, as she did at Melbourne, and she would do so again in Tokyo, giving her a career total of 18, an absolute Olympic record that would last until it was bettered by Michael Phelps at London in 2012.

Shanaze Reade, the hometown favorite and World Champion in 2007, 2008, and 2010, was seeking to redeem herself from the 2008 Olympics when, in podium position during the final, she clipped Chausson’s wheel and crashed, placing her out of contention.
In the seeding run, Buchanan, Walker, and Pajón posted the three fastest times and held the advantage going into the semi-finals, where Pajón dominated her heat by winning all three of the races, just in front of Pottier every time.  Buchanan and Reade were a class above the rest in their heat, placing in either first or second in every race. In the final Pajón continued her dominance and was never seriously challenged for the title, beginning with a terrific start and never relenting. Walker, who had been underperforming during in the semi-finals, took advantage of a great start and gave it her all, finishing in the silver medal position. The surprise bronze medal winner was the unheralded Laura Smulders of the Netherlands, who had never won a major international BMX medal. Buchanan and Reade, meanwhile, suffered from poor starts and placed fifth and sixth respectively. Pajón’s gold medal was the second ever for Colombia at the Olympics, after María Isabel Urrutia, who won the heavyweight division of women’s weightlifting at the 2000 Summer Games.

After her double gold in the 3 and 5 km, all eyes were on Schouten to make it three golds. However, given the less predictable nature of the event, other names were also expected to do well. This included two-time world champion Ivanie Blondin, inline skating great Francesca Lollobrigida, Korea’s Kim Bo-Reum, as well as Schouten’s teammate Marijke Groenewoud, who had surprisingly claimed the 2021 world title when Schouten was held up in the final sprint.
The semi-finals were rather nervous. In the first, Groenwoud fell, but she was able to return to the group and qualify for the final. That could not be said for defending champion Nana Takagi. After her dramatic fall earlier in the team pursuit, she again fell in the second semi-final.
In the final, the race was fairly compact, but saw Groenewoud fall again and lose contact. With two laps left, an intact pack (save for Groenewoud) started the final sprint. Valérie Maltais increased the speed, hoping to launch her teammate Blondin to victory. At the bell, Schouten had taken the lead, followed by Blondin and Lollobrigida. The Italian briefly lost her balance, leaving Blondin in front going into the final curve. With 50 m to go, Schouten passed the Canadian, crossing the line first, while Lollobrigida was just too late to join the fight for gold and came in third.
By winning her third gold and fourth medal in Beijing, Schouten became the most successful Dutch Winter Olympian ever at a single Games, beating three-time champions Ard Schenk and Yvonne van Gennip.

Sürmeneli recorded unanimous points decisions in her first three contests before edging a hard-fought final with China’s Gu Hong. Gong started well but a turning point came in the second round when she was penalised a point for holding in addition to losing the round on the judges’ scorecards. The Chinese fighter fought back in the final round but by then the damage was done and Sürmeneli was ahead on three of the five scorecards.

The first two runs were taken by Hackl but his lead over Prock was limited to just a hundredth of a second at half way. The third run changed things around as the German could not quite match Prock’s speed and the Austrian rose to the gold medal position, but this was a position he could not hang on to permanently. Prock’s time on the final run was only seventh fastest and the clock stopped to reveal that Hackl had retained his title by a miniscule nine hundreths of a second. Hackl became the first man in history to successfully defend an Olympic singles title. In his first Olympic Games Italian Armin Zöggeler took home the bronze meal. This was a task made considerably easier by the crash that ended the hopes of America’s Duncan Kennedy on the third run.

Germany’s Lena Schöneborn had placed second to Cazé at the 2007 Worlds, but she took the early lead by winning the fencing, moving ahead by 60 points after two phases. Schöneborn, a former swimmer, would finish 10th in the swimming, fourth in riding, and ninth in cross-country, and would not be headed, winning the gold medal by 40 points over Britain’s Heather Fell. This was Germany’s first gold medal in pentathlon since 1936.
Cazé attempted to redeem herself, finishing second in the 200 freestyle, the third section. She placed behind American Sheila Taormina, who was the real story of the women’s event. It was not surprising that Taormina had won the swim, as she had won a relay gold medal in swimming at the 1996 Olympics. After that she turned to triathlon, and competed in that sport at the Sydney Olympics (6th) and Athina Olympics (23rd). Taking up modern pentathlon after the 2004 Olympics, she became the first woman to compete in three different sports at the Olympics. Unfortunately, in Beijing she was done in by her first two events. She placed 28th shooting and then last in fencing. She was last after two phases. Even though she won the next two phases, swimming and riding, and placed seventh in the run, she could move up only to 19th position overall. Still, it hardly diminished her accomplishment.
That was how the event and the results seemed to have ended. In 2015, however, the IOC began re-testing samples from the 2008 Beijing and 2012 London Olympics, using newer, more advanced testing techniques, in an effort to find those who had used performance enhancing drugs (PEDs), but in whom it could not be detected at the time of those Olympics. This was one of the many events affected.

France’s Pauline Ferrand-Prévot, however, winner of the past two editions of the World Championships and also the 2021 European Champion, was much more favored. Jolanda Neff of Switzerland, meanwhile, had won the test event. The qualification for the event was completed prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, and thus was not impacted by the delay of the Tokyo Games.
Ferrand-Prévot slid out early in the race to give Neff a lead that she never relinquished. Great Britain’s Evie Richards, the 2018 Commonwealth Games runner-up, looked to be in contention early on, but she was soon replaced in the lead pack by Neff’s compatriots Sina Frei and Linda Indergand. The three Swiss riders soon pulled ahead of all other competitors and captured all three medals by a comfortable margin.
This was Switzerland’s first podium sweep since the 1936 Berlin Games, when they captured all of the medals in the floor exercise, although in that case bronze was shared by a German competitor. Switzerland’s only other clean sweep had come in 1924, in the pommeled horse, when the nation had taken the top four spots. As for cycling sweeps, this had only occurred previously at the 1904 St. Louis Olympics, in many of the odd, US-dominated races, and the 1906 Intercalated Games, when France captured the podium in the road race.

After five minutes, Grossain found himself on his back, but reversed Okano, putting him onto his back, and at high risk of defeat. Okano grabbed Grossain’s collar in a form of okuri-eri-jime, and suddenly he realized that Grossain was not putting up any fight. He looked at the referee, trying to signal that Grossain was unconscious, but the referee did not acknowledge it. When a Japanese coach pointed out the limp legs of the Frenchman, the referee declared ippon for Okano. Okano immediately set to work to revive Grossain, using katsu, a traditional Japanese resuscitation technique, and he was not injured. After that, the semi-finals were anticlimactic. Okano defeated Kim in the second match by decision while in the first semi-final, Wolfgang Hoffman (GER) defeated Bregman.

In the 2009 season, Nesbitt had claimed the World Cup and had won the world title on the ice of the Richmond Olympic Oval. During the Olympic season, she had won all four World Cup races held. Behind Nesbitt, there was no clear number two. The Dutch skaters, Annette Gerritsen and Margot Boer, had both produced some good results, as had Japanese surprise Nao Kodaira, Canada’s Kristina Groves and Monique Angermüller of Germany. Another German, Anni Friesinger had long been a force in the event, but she had suffered of injuries earlier in the season and appeared not to be in top shape.
But the first to go below 1:17 was Laurine van Riessen, who had won a World Cup race in the previous season. Her 1:16.72 would turn out to be hard to beat. The first to do so was Gerritsen, who had recovered from a fall in the 500 m. She had gone off much faster than her team mate, struggling but prevailing, on the final curve on the tough Richmond ice, finishing in 1:16.58. Nesbitt, racing next, started much slower than the leading Dutch couple. But she preserved her strength for the final lap, converting her half-second deficit into a narrow, but sufficient, 0.02-second lead.

It was a Bermuda rig, also called a Marconi rig, with a specific design of mast and rigging.
The competition was held in boats provided by the organization. Each of them was named after a German city; the eventual winner Daan Kagchelland sailed in the Nürnberg (Nuremberg). The regattas were affected by the poor weather. Competition had to be suspended for an hour and a half on the first day due to stormy weather. Although the races were held, rain and heavy wind gave an advantage to the heavier sailors. By contrast, the remaining days were plagued by a lack of wind, causing the races to be postponed on three occasions.
The battle for the gold was between Kagchelland, German sailor Werner Krogmann and Briton Peter Scott. The latter took the lead on the first day, being joined by the Dutchman after four races. The sixth heat proved vital, as Kagchelland sailed to victory with Krogmann and Scott way back. The Dutch sailor would need only a 10th place in the final race to secure the gold. However, Krogmann and Scott collided, causing the British boat to forfeit and drop to bronze medal position. Peter Scott was the son of Robert F. Scott, the famed polar explorer who died on Antarctica in 1912 after losing the race to the South Pole to Norwegian Roald Amundsen.

The first pair was a tough one with Norway’s Tom Erik Oxholm, who had won bronze in the 5,000, facing American Mike Woods, fourth at the 1979 World All-Arounds.

Kulhavý had been the 2011 overall World Cup leader and had placed 18th at the 2008 Summer Olympics, while Schurter, who won bronze at the 2008 Games, had been the 2009 World Champion and the 2010 and 2012 overall World Cup leader.

Although Absalon and Schurter had a great start and led the pack for the first several minutes, Absalon suffered a puncture in the opening lap and abandoned the course. This left room for Schurter, Kulhavý, and Italian Marco Fontana, who had been fifth in Beijing, to form a lead group that began to drift from the rest of the cyclists, although they were soon joined by José Antonio Hermida of Spain, the 2004 Olympic silver medalist and 2010 World Champion. By the third lap Burry Stander of South Africa, fifteenth at the 2008 Games, caught up to the main group with an impressive charge after a poor start that left him in 11th place early in the race. These five men led the field for the remainder of the event, and it soon became clear among them who would be battling for the gold medal. Although at some point over the course each of these five riders made a charge for first place, and all were leading at some point, Hermida and Stander began to fade in the second half of the race, with Hermida having difficulty maintaining the pace and Stander seemingly exhausted from his initial charge to the lead group. Stander would attempt several more charges throughout the race, but fell back soon after each push, leaving Schurter, Kulhavý, and Fontana to compete for the medals.
In the final lap Fontana struggled to keep pace and eventually dropped far enough back that he was nearly overtaken by Hermida for the bronze medal. Schurter and Kulhavý never waned, however, and, unlike the women’s race that had been decided long before the finish line, the men’s event came down to a sprint between these two riders. In the end it was Kulhavý who earned the gold medal, edging out Schurter by one second, who was forced to settle for silver. Fontana managed to stave off Hermida’s challenge, claiming bronze by a margin of four seconds, while Stander finished one second after Hermida, but still half a minute faster than the next rider. For Hermida it was his second fourth-place finish at the Olympics, following his performance at the 2000 Games (he had been tenth in Beijing).

Needing only a modest distance to secure gold for his team Masahiko Harada made a complete mess of his jump and gifted the title to Germany. The most recent World Championship title had gone to Finland but Japanese success in Nagano had earned them the mantle of favourites for this event.
Halfway through the first round all was going well for Japan. Okabe and Saito had put the Japanese into lead and next it was the turn of world champion Harada to jump, but Harada’s effort turned into an unmitigated disaster, and even caused his team to be subtracted points from their total. Austria, Germany and Norway would all overtake Japan and fill the first three places as the first round closed. During the interval between the two rounds snow fell and it seemed possible that the second round might be cancelled and Austria would be crowned champions. To the relief of the home fans the weather improved and the event continued. The pattern for the second set of jumps mirrored the first and Japan gained back points from their opening jumpers. When Harada stood at the top of the hill for his second jump the title was again within his team’s reach. As his nation collectively held their breath he came down the ramp, leapt and then hung in the air for an eternity, landing only at 137.0 m to equal the Olympic best set minutes earlier by Okabe. This gave Japan a clear lead with only a distance of 90.5 needed by Funaki to ensure victory. Funaki’s leap of 125 m was the cue for wild celebrations and considerable relief for the home team.

And then Bob Hayes ran the fastest relay leg ever seen, possibly even still. Estimates of his 100 metre split are as low as 8.5-8.6 seconds, although most track statisticians think 8.80-8.90 is more likely. That would still be in the range of another stunning anchor run by Carl Lewis at the Barcelona Olympics, 28 years later, and on an artificial surface track. Hayes won pulling away by almost three metres, having made up at least six metres on the other anchor runners.

Rigondeaux had been the undisputed star of the bantamweight class since Sydney but it was his old rival, Ağası Məmmədov, who arrived in Athens as reigning world champion, having upset the Cuban in 2003 in Thailand. Rigondeaux had previously beaten Məmmədov, then fighting for Turkey under the name Ağası Agaguloğlu, on his way to his Olympic triumph in 2000.
In the event Rigondeaux and Məmmədov were not to renew rivalries in Athens as the Azeri fighter fell victim to Worapoj Petchkoom of Thailand at the semi-final stage. Rigondeaux’s journey to his 2nd Olympic title was, much like his 1st, relatively uneventful and was lacking a serious challenge from any of his 5 opponents. Even though Thailand had imported a Cuban coach in an attempt to emulate the style and success of the Cuban system, Petchkoom was unable to cope with the long stinging jabs of Rigondeux and was defeated 22 points to 13.
In 2007 Rigondeux and a team mate defected ahead of the Pan American Games in Brazil. They signed a professional contact with a German promoter but he reappeared in Brazil wishing to return to Cuba. Two years later he again defected to Germany and this time did not return home.

China had won the last two World Championships, while the last four European titles were split among the Soviet Union and East Germany (GDR). Peru had been on the podium at the 1982 and 1986 Worlds, led by Cecilia Tait and Denise Fajardo, considered the best female players in the world. Cuba had been runners-up at the 1986 World Championships, but boycotted the 1988 Olympics. Eventually Peru and the USSR made it to the final, where they engaged in an epic match. Peru won the first two sets, 15-10, 15-12, and they led the third set, 12-6. The Soviets called a timeout and made several substitutions and fought back. They won the third and fourth sets, and won the first six points of the fifth set. But Peru would not quit, tying the score 7-7. Then the USSR pulled gradually ahead, only to see the Lazarus-like Peruvians take the lead at 15-14. After both teams fought off match points, the Soviet Union prevailed, 17-15 in five sets.

Women’s volleyball had become very popular in Peru, where it flourished in the poor neighborhoods of Lima, when fields were created for girls to play (boys played football). Peru hosted the 1982 World Championships (finishing second), and nearly won the first Peruvian gold in 40 years in Seoul. They were coached by a Korean (Park Man-Bok), the women’s team coach since 1973. Three of the players later became members of parliament: Gaby Pérez, Cenaida Uribe, and Cecilia Tait. Tait was an orphan, who was adopted by a volleyball club at the age of 12.

Neither Nykänen or Weißflog held the world title, that championship having been won by Czechoslovakia’s Jiří Parma in 1985 but  Nykänen would arrive at Calgary as the holder of the prestigious Four Hills tournament. Norwegian hopes were pinned on World Cup holder Vegard Opaas whilst the Austrian pairing of Andreas Felder and Ernst Vettori had been consistently amongst the world’s best since the last Olympic Games.
After the completion of the first round the leader board had a strange look to it. It may have been no surprise to find Nykänen in the gold medal position but the top fifteen included only one Austrian, no Germans from either side of the border and no Norwegians. Weißflog did make the lower region of the top twenty but Opaas, the top Norwegian, languished all the way down in twenty-sixth place. Czechoslovakian and Yugoslavian jumpers were the top performers on the first jump with the two nations combining to produce eight of the top thirteen at the half way mark.
Nykänen’s second jump was a copy of his first and no one could challenge the mastery of the twenty four year old Finn. If there was little drama in the challenge for the Olympic title the same could not be said of the other medals with less than a point covering the next three jumpers. Pavel Ploc maintained the excellent form he had shown on the World Cup circuit to narrowly place second ahead of his less well known team-mate Jiří Malec. While Nykänen’s feat was covered widely by the world’s press another jumper equaled him in terms of media coverage. Eddie Edwards was a British ski jumper who had only two years of jumping behind him and was, at 74 kg and wearing a thick pair of spectacles, an unlikely competitor.

Their countryman Gustaf Dyrssen took the lead after the fencing competition and held it throughout to win quite easily. In addition to his gold medal, he was awarded possession of the Challenge Prize that had been donated by Baron Pierre de Coubertin. The United States’ Robert Sears was in third place after three events, but faltered in the riding and cross-country running, and finished eighth. The medals were taken by the above three Swedes.

Kramer had dominated the event for the past decade, as Olympic Champion of 2010 and 2014, and runner-up of 2006 and World Champion 2007-2017 (save 2011). Even in the 2017/2018 season, Kramer had won both World Cups he contested. But some challengers to his dominance had appeared. At the Dutch Olympic Trials, Kramer was surprisingly defeated by Bob de Vries. And in the Calgary World Cup, his world record was taken by Ted-Jan Bloemen. Bloemen, who had raced for Netherlands through 2014, had since switched allegiance to Canada on account of his father’s dual citizenship. Further medal contenders were Norway’s Sverre Lunde Pedersen, winner of the Erfurt World Cup, New Zealand’s Peter Michael, bronze medalist at the 2017 Worlds, and Jan Blokhuijsen, 2014 silver medallist.
The race started with home favorite and 2010 silver medalist, Lee Seung-Hun, racing 6:14.15, a time then pipped by Michael with 6:14.07. The following pair then saw an exciting duel between Bloemen and Pedersen. The Canadian started faster, then briefly faded and he was eclipsed by the Norwegian after 3,000 m. Bloemen then fought back and bridged a one-second gap in the final to laps to cross the finish line at the same time. Examination of the photo finish was needed to determine that Bloemen had edged out Pedersen by a mere 0.002. Kramer, who had noticed all contenders had started out fast and had faded a little in the end, then used the opposite strategy in his race. Trailing by 1.6 seconds at the halfway mark, Kramer’s low 29-second laps then quickly moved him into the fastest time. His 6:09.76 at the finish meant a new Olympic Record, bettering his own mark from four years prior. His third gold in a row made Kramer the first person to win the 5,000 m gold three times, and the first male speed skater to produce a “threepeat”, after Bonnie Blair and Claudia Pechstein.

Champion USSR, third-placed Poland and sixth-ranked GDR, however, did not show up in Los Angeles, having joined the Communist Bloc boycott of the Games. They were joined by European qualifiers Hungary and Czechoslovakia (9th and 10th at the 1982 Worlds), as well as Americas qualifier Cuba (13th). They were replaced by West Germany, Sweden, Switzerland, South Korea, Spain and Iceland. Of the teams competing, Yugoslavia, losers of the last World Championship final, were favored for the gold. Contenders were Romania (which did not join the boycott), Denmark (fourth at the Worlds) and West Germany, a former World Champion (1978).
In Group A, Yugoslavia suffered an early set-back in the first match, drawing (22-22) against puny Iceland, having led the game 21-16. They recovered and beat Japan, Algeria and Switzerland. The final pool encounter would decide whether Romania or Yugoslavia would go into the final. Romania was ahead almost the entire match, until the Yugoslavs pulled ahead with a penalty shot netted by Mile Isaković in the final minute of the game. In the other pool, the West Germans and the Danes were the teams to beat. They met in the final pool match, having both won all of their prior matches. The West Germans were helped by Sepp Wunderlich, who scored nine times for a 20-18 victory by Germany.
The teams competing in the final were both coached by medallists from 1972. Yugoslavia’s coach Branislav Pokrajac had won the gold back in 1972, while Romania’s Simion Schobel coached the Federal Republic of Germany. The final was a close affair, the teams remaining in balance through 15-15. The Yugoslavs then scored three times in a row. Germany kept alive, scored twice to 18-17 with less than half a minute remaining, but Yugoslavia sat out the remainder of the match. West Germany’s silver medal meant the first handball medal won by a team outside of Eastern Europe.

The individual and team road race events were held concurrently, with the team event based on the times of the best four finishing individual riders for each team.
The riders were sent off at two minute intervals, with the last scheduled rider starting at 7 AM (0700).  Of the 151 entrants only 123 riders eventually started.  The individual event was won by Rudolph “Okey” Lewis of South Africa.  He started quickly and led by 11½ minutes at 120 km.  Increasing the lead to 17 minutes at 200 km., he slowed slightly coming in, but still won by almost nine minutes over Freddie Grubb of Great Britain.  As the second starter, going off at 2:02 AM, he was the first overall finisher as well.  Little is known about Lewis’ cycling career, even by South African experts.  It was noted that the weather at the start time of 2 AM was cool, with no wind, which favored the very early starters.  By 7 AM a strong westerly wind was blowing directly into the faces of the later starting riders.  As the second starter, Lewis definitely benefited from his start position.
The previous record for the Mälaren Rundt was 11-22:07.0, set in 1909 by Henrik Morén of Sweden, a 10-time winner of the race, including nine consecutive wins from 1902-1910.  In 1912 Morén also won the Swedish seletcing competition held on this track in 11-56:23.  Lewis lowered the record by almost 41 minutes.  No less than 16 riders, including Morén himself, in 15th place, bettered the previous record.
In addition to the Olympic medals, a Diploma of Merit was given to cyclists who finished within 25% of the winner’s time.  As Lewis finished in 10-42:39, all riders under 13-23:18.8 qualified, and thus 81 of the 94 riders who finished received this special diploma.

Final placement was determined by a Majority Placement rule.  Thus, if a skater was ranked first by a majority of the judges, that skater was placed first overall, and the process was repeated for each place.

Button was in a commanding lead after the compulsory figures ahead of Seibt and Grogan, he could easily have played it safe through the free program to another Olympic victory. But also on this occasion Button had something new to show the figure skating audience. Under storming applause he landed a triple loop in his free program, being the first skater ever to do that in a competition. Button was certainly a man for the big Olympic occasions!
In a very close battle for the silver medal, Seibt was able to stay ahead of Grogan with the closest possible margin. Young Hayes Jenkins had to be content with 4th place. Carlo Fassi of Italy was the second best European in 6th place. He became European Champion in 1953 and 1954 and was later to become a famous figure skating coach.
At the World Championship in Paris one week later Button ended his tremendous amateur figure skating career with his 5th World title. This time it was a clean sweep for the US skaters, Grogan in silver and Hayes Jenkins in bronze position.

While most sprints and horizontal jumps benefited from the altitude of Ciudad de México, with numerous world records set, the women did not match Korsakova’s world record. And Korsakova would not get to the final of the event, placing fifth in the first semi-final.

Zöggeler , a Carabiniere from the Sud-Tirol had won the World Championships in the two previous seasons and was, in contrast to his rivals, at 28–years-old, approaching the peak of his career.

They were unable to find out much about the competitions, except that one event was to be a revolver contest over 30 metres.  Sumner Paine brought along everything he could find in Paris, including a Colt Army revolver, a Smith & Wesson Russian revolver, and a pocket gun for each of them, as well as John’s .22 calibre Stevens pistol and Sumner’s .22 Wurfflein pistol.  They also brought along 3,500 rounds of ammunition, which proved to ample, as they eventualy only fired a total of 96 rounds.
The Colt Army revolver was the famous gun of the old west, also known as the Frontier Six-Shooter.  The Smith & Wesson Russian or No. 3 Single Action revolver was the usually the choice of the knowledgable pistol shooter of the era.  The gun was made in large quantities, as the Smith & Wesson plant had received huge orders from Russia beginning in 1870, and almost 250,000 had been manufactured by the time of the Athens Olympics.  The Wurfflein pistol was a single-shot pistol with a tip-up barrel, hinged at the front end of the frame.  They were popular in shooting events in the 19th century, winning many matches and setting many records.
The shooters shot in groups of three.  The first group was Pantelis Karasvedas, Sidney Merlin and Sumner Paine.  The second group was Sanidis, Aristovoulos Petmezas, and John Paine.  The composition of the subsequent groups is not known.
This was the first pistol event of the 1896 Olympics and the Paines outclassed their competitors, despite the fact that they had difficulty with the conditions.  The sunlight was almost blinding and they had problems seeing the black target with its white center.  In addition, both of their pistols had been sighted for 50 yards, not 25 metres, and they had to make some minor sighting adjustments.

The other two Norwegians fell back by some distance, and going into the home straight Panzhinsky held the lead. However a tremendous surge by Kryukov saw him win by a fraction of a second on the line ahead of his compatriot. Northug finished in the bronze medal position, some distance behind the winner. There were some complaints about the schedule. The B-final had been eliminated and the final was held soon after the second semi-final, giving the qualifiers from the first semi-final a big advantage.

Susi Erdmann had begun the Olympic cycle as the dominant force in the sport but she had later been superseded by her compatriot Sandra Kiriasis. The strength of the Germans was made clear by the fact that World Cup runner-up Cathleen Martini failed to make the team. The only realistic threat to German dominance came from the USA and, with home advantage, the Italians. True to form Kiriasis and her brakewoman, the former speed skater Anja Schneiderheinze, led on the first run followed by her German compatriot Erdmann.  Difficult track conditions caused the field to close up after the second run but Germany still held the top two positions. The third run effectively decided the Olympic championship as while Kiriasis took her lead from a tenth to over half a second as Erdmann faltered badly and slipped from second to fourth. Kiriasis and Schneiderheinze comfortably held their lead to the finish and as Germany II slipped further down the leaderboard it was to be the sleds from USA, Italy and Canada that would contest the other medals. Canada I’s late charge could not propel them onto the podium and it was to be the American pairing of pilot Shauna Rohbock and brakewoman Valerie Fleming who would finish ahead of Italy for silver. Rohbock’s Olympic medal came four years after she suffered the disappointment of being dropped as eventual Salt Lake City champion Jill Bakken’s brakewoman shortly before the Games. Gerda Weissensteiner’s bronze medal meant that she became the first person of either sex to win Olympic medals at both bobsleigh and luge.

The exceptions were China and Russia who replaced Colombia and Spain.
New Zealand arrived in Japan as clear favourites as they had won the most recent World Championship and were winners of more than half the tournaments on the World Rugby Sevens tour since the Rio Olympics. Joining them as qualifiers from that tour were reigning champions Australia and the North American duo of Canada and the USA.
The big surprise of the pool stages was the elimination of the Canadians who fell behind to early scores against both France and Fiji and could not recover their deficit in either game. Both victorious teams continued to make an impression in the knockout stages. Fiji’s women, long in the shadow of their men’s team, emerged as a major force by beating the 2016 champions, Australia, after surviving a late game onslaught by the Wallabies to win 14-12.
The semi-finals produced an all-Pacific pairing and an all European pairing. Fiji once again excelled to hold New Zealand to a 17 all tie at the end of regulation time. New Zealand gathered possession from the kick-off in sudden-death extra time and the move resulted in Gayle Broughton crossing the try line for the win. The other semi-final was a clash between “old enemies”  France and Great Britain. France eased into a 21-12 halftime lead over Great Britain, but Britain fought back to just seven points down when they conceded a penalty as they attempted to force the game into extra time. Fittingly, the star of the game, with two tries, was Anne-Cecile Ciofani, whose parents were both track and field Olympians in the 1980s.
So, the final was played out between New Zealand, who had dominated the world game since Rio, and France, who had only qualified via the final qualifying event. There was to be no fairy-tale ending for the French as New Zealand imposed their superiority when captain Sarah Hirini released Michaela Blyde to score the opening try on the minute mark. France fought back but a couple of moments of indiscipline cost them dearly as New Zealand pulled away to lead 19-5 at half time. The two team traded scores in the second half but this was not enough for the French as they went down by 26-12 at the final whistle.
Fiji continued their excellent tournament by taking the bronze medal with victory over Great Britain. The Fijians, as they had done in several previous matches, blitzed their opponents in the first half of their game before holding on for the win. This was a huge breakthrough for the Pacific island in the women’s game. Fiji also provided the top try scorer in Reapi Ulunisau with eight while Tyla Nathan-Wong of New Zealand shared the title of top points scorer with Ulunisau with the pair level on 40 points.

China possessed one of the greats of the discipline, Wu Minxia, who was the World Champion in 2011, 2013 and 2015, and also a four-time Olympic gold medalist in 2004, 2008 and 2012. She teamed up with Shi Tingmao after the 2012 Olympics and the pair had become unbeatable, winning all 14 competitions they had competed, including the 2013 and 2015 World Championships and 2016 World Cup. Despite Minxia being over the age of 30, there was little to suggest that would be a barrier as she sought another gold in Rio, and she did just that as Minxia and Tingmao held off the challenge of the Italian pair of Tania Cagnotto and Francesca Dallapè with the Australians Maddison Keeney and Anabelle Smith taking bronze despite lying eighth and last after round two. Going into the fifth and final dive thety were still trailing in fifth place but a final score of 71.10 promoted them into the bronze medal position ahead of the Canadian and Malaysian pairs. The Chinese pair led from the first round and clinched it with two outstanding dives in rounds four and five as Minxai became the first person to win five Olympic diving golds.

She had competed at the 1988 judo demonstration event in Seoul, winning this division easily, but she retired after the 1989 season and was not in Barcelona to grace the Olympic tatamis with her presence. In her absence, Kim Mi-Jeong won the gold medal easily, defeating Japan’s Yoko Tanabe in the final, as she had at the 1991 Worlds.

The host nation was also admitted, along with continental qualifiers Algeria, Brazil, Kuwait and Spain.
Sweden were easily the best team in Pool A. Their strongest opposition came from the Russians, which tied 20-20 shortly before time only to lose out 22-20. But the real drama was in the Croatia - Russia match, which was to decide the second qualifier from the group. With 37 seconds left to play, the score tied at 24-24, Dmitry Torgovanov was penalized, and the successive Croatian attack was crowned with a goal by Božidar Jović. The Croatians went through to the semis, despite losing by a large margin to Sweden in their fifth group match (27-18).
In the other pool, World Champions France played as expected, winning their first four matches before succumbing to Germany in the last match (24-23), yet securing qualification for the semi-finals. The remaining ticket was to be decided between Spain, silver medallists at the European Championships a few months before the Games, and Egypt, which had the best ever African performance at the World Championships, with a sixth place. Each team had three wins and a loss (against France) before they faced each other in the final pool game. The Spaniards were in the lead throughout the game, but Egypt was never far, losing out only 20-19.
The Spaniards, featuring 1992 champion Talant Duyshebayev (then with the Unified Team), didn’t hold out in the semi-finals, and they were outclassed by Sweden 25-20. The other semi-final was a replay of the 1995 World Championships final. The Croatians were eager for revenge, and took an early lead. By half-time, that had been increased to four points, which was never relinquished and held until the end (24-20).
In the final, the Swedes started out poorly. Croatia capitalized on that, building up an early lead that had stretched to five goals at the half-time mark (16-11). In an all-out effort to prevent a repeat of their loss in the 1992 Olympic final, Sweden initiated a comeback. Wingers Pierre Thorsson (8 goals) and Erik Hajas (7) brought their team closer and closer, but not close enough to hold the Croatians from winning by one goal (27-26). For Croatia, it was the first ever Olympic title won by that country. Five of its players had already earned a bronze while still playing for Yugoslavia back in 1988: Alvaro Načinović, Goran Perkovac, Iztok Puc, Zlatan Saračević and Irfan Smajlagić.
One of the players on the Spanish team that earned the bronze medal turned out to have an excellent Olympics for other reasons as well. Iñaki Urdangarín met Princess Cristina de Borbón, herself a sailing competitor at the 1988 Olympics; they married in 1997. In late 2011, Urdangarín discredited the royal family by being named in a corruption and money laundering case, which is still under investigation as of 2012.

This established 1976 medalist and current European champion Viktor Rybakov as the clear favourite at featherweight though both Luis Pizarro of Puerto Rico and Adolfo Horta, a Cuban who was dropping down a weight division, were also thought of contenders. Horta defeated Pizzaro in the quarter-final and then reached the final via a walkover, but Rybakov was eliminated in his semi-final by East Germany’s Rudi Fink, a fighter who was national champion but who was previously untested in major international competition. Fink proved a revelation and took his semi-final form into the gold medal bout and, with the crowd in the arena chanting “Rudi, Rudi” in his honour, won a close but deserved decision over Horta. During the final Horta’s trainer was sent from the arena for excessive coaching. Fink never again reached the same level of success and was beaten in his first bout at the 1981 European Championships where Rybakov was again champion. Although they did not win medals in Moscow three boxers present went on to long and successful professional careers.

His prowess had waned somewhat in recent years, however, and several canoeists had stepped up to take the crown. Among them were Ed McKeever of Great Britain, 2010 World Champion, and Piotr Siemionowski of Poland, the reigning World Champion. With the event’s appearance at the Olympic Games, however, many experienced paddlers had thrown their hats in the ring to contend for the title, ensuring that there would be plenty of worthy challengers vying for the title.
McKeever’s hometown advantage was immediately evident, as he posted the fastest time in the heats amid tough competition. In the semi-finals, however, Canada’s Mark de Jonge and Spain’s Saúl Craviotto were able to complete the course quicker. De Jonge was a relatively unheralded paddler, with his only major international medals having come in different events at the 2003 and 2007 Pan American Games, but Craviotto was a two-time World Champion in the K-1 4x200 metres and an Olympic champion in the K-2 500, certainly making him a prospect for a podium spot in the K-1 200. McKeever posted the third-fastest time and won his semifinal heat, but Siemionowski was eliminated and Rauhe just barely survived to the medal round. In the final McKeever led after the initial burst from the start and never relented, capturing the gold medal without any serious challenge. Craviotto’s effort earned him silver while De Jonge edged out France’s Maxime Beaumont by three-hundredths of a second to win the bronze.

Following a publication of an article about Dutch scientists conferring and perhaps influencing the ice maker for the National Speed Skating Oval, the Swedish skater had staged a press conference in which he accused the Dutch of trying to manipulate the sport. All parties – including ice maker Mark Messer (CAN) – denied any actual manipulation, and the race got underway without any formal protests or other impact.
As in the 5,000 m, Patrick Roest was the first favorite on the ice. Although his personal best of 12:35 had come at a similar rink, conditions and form forced Roest to a slightly slower schedule, which saw him end up at 12:44.59. That time was enough to survive the next two pairs, including the second Dutch skater, 2014 champion Jorrit Bergsma, who ended in 12:48.94.
Nils van der Poel seemed unimpressed by these times. As in the 5,000 m, he went off on a very steady schedule, recording a slowest lap of 30.38 (lap three) and speeding up to a final lap of 28.60. With these lap times, he handsomely defeated Roest again, but also bettered his own world record, which he had set at the 2021 World Championships. Behind the Swede, his pair mate Davide Ghiotto became the surprise of the race. After tagging along Van der Poel for a few laps, he settled into a pace that brought him to 12:45.98, enough for a bronze medal – the second in a row for Italy after Nicola Tumolero in 2018.
As he had already hinted at earlier, van der Poel announced his retirement from the sport after his second gold, although he hinted that he had tried to retire twice before and had failed. Remarkably, he also published a website that detailed his training methods as well as his training schedule since 2019.

Teams were also reduced from four to three members. The 2018 World Equestrian Games had been played out before the host country, the USA, and an experienced Swedish team. Despite the pandemic contrived delay to the Olympic Games, the same two teams rose to the top in Tokyo.
Sweden, having already provided three of the top five in the individual event, qualified for the final with a perfect score of three clear rounds, a fence ahead of Germany and Belgium. It was France, however, who made the running in the final.

Unfortunately for Leprevost, her horse refused to cooperate and was eliminated whilst on the verge of victory.
With France dropping out of contention, the focus switched to Sweden and the USA as they tied on eight faults, which necessitated a jump-off for the championships.

Switzerland and Great Britain, the 2012 and 2013 world champions respectively, were ranked second and third. Sweden’s skip was Margaretha Sigfridsson, four-time world runner-up (2002, 2009, 2012, 2013), while Switzerland sent Mirjam Ott, to her fourth Olympics. Ott was the 2012 World Champion, as well as the 2002 and 2006 Olympic runner-up. Great Britain was headed by Scotland’s Eve Muirhead, the reigning world champion and 2010 runner-up. She too was a veteran of the 2010 Winter Olympics, but had finished seventh among ten nations. Never to be underestimated was Canada who, despite being ranked fourth and not having won Olympic gold since the sport’s debut in 1998, was represented by Jennifer Jones, a household name in the country. Jones was not a rookie on the international scene – she was the 2008 World Champion – but she was much better known for her success at the Canadian national championships: four-times champion (2005, 2008-2010), thrice runner-up (2006, 2011, 2013), and twice bronze-medalist (2007 and 2012). Almost as well-known nationally was Jill Officer, who had been Jones’ second for over a decade and shared in all of her friend’s successes. Another notable skip was Kim Ji-sun, who headed South Korea’s first delegation to Olympic curling.
If the world had not heard of the Canadian team prior to the 2014 Olympics, then it certainly knew their names after: Canada’s Jones became the first female skip to lead her rink through Olympic round robin play undefeated, a suitable follow-up to Kevin Martin’s similar achievement for the Canadian men in 2010. Sigfridsson was not far behind, however, finishing 7-2, while Ott and Muirhead ended with a record of 5-4 each, sufficient to take them to the medal round despite surprising challenges from China and Japan. Notable in this portion of the tournament was the Great Britain-United States match, where Muirhead set an Olympic record by scoring seven points in a single end against Erika Brown’s rink.
Jones, having revealed herself as a significant threat, defeated Murihead in the semifinals, despite a valiant effort that saw the latter nearly recover from an early 3-0 deficit, while Sigfridsson vanquished Ott. The bronze medal game was close throughout, with Ott able to force Muirhead into a tenth end, but Great Britain emerged victorious. This made them the youngest rink to win an Olympic medal, beating China’s bronze medal-winning team by nearly two years. In the final, Canada and Sweden were neck and neck at the end of the fifth end, when Jones decided to blank the sixth and seventh ends to obtain last rock in the eighth. There she scored only one point, bringing Canada into the ninth with a score of 4-3, but her rink’s excellent shooting earned them two points that clinched their victory. Jones’ rink joined Martin’s as undefeated in Olympic tournament play, the first woman to achieve this feat.

Adams had by far the better of the all-time marks, but those had been set years ago, and Gong had the better marks in 2021, and had won the World Championships in 2017 and 2019. Adams had two Olympic golds, from 2008 and 2012, and four World titles, consecutively from 2007-13. Gong had won silver at London in 2012 and bronze in Beijing in 2008, but sadly, neither came at the Games themselves as she was advanced to those medals later after doping disqualifications.
American Raven Saunders was the first thrower in the final and her 19.65 would have been good for the silver medal, although she improved it in round five with 19.79. Four throwers later, Gong recorded 19.95, which settled the competition for gold, although she would have three better marks – with 19.98 in round three, 20.53 in round five, and 20.58 in round six.
Adams rounded out the podium, throwing 19.62 in round three, giving her a fourth Olympic medal and a full set with two golds, a silver, and a bronze. Gong’s gold also completed her set of Olympic medals. Saunders stood out during the competition, competing in a mask in both qualifying and final, with her hair dyed green on the left side and purple on the right.

Lagutin had lost in the semi-finals of the Rome Olympics but had been virtually unbeatable ever since and had claimed both the 1961 and 1963 versions of the European Championships. One possible threat emerged at the start of 1964 in the shape of America’s Toby Gibson who reached the US Olympic team on the back of 12 straight inside the distance victories. Gibson lived up to his billing in his first fight in Tokyo but came unstuck against the unorthodox Ghanaian Eddie Davies who won with the help of two points deductions against Gibson. Meanwhile Lagutin moved serenely through the tournament although serene was not an apt description of his second round opponent José Roberto Chirino. Chirino became incensed by the decision of the referee to warn him for a minor rules infraction and struck out at the official, earning himself a disqualification. The Soviet boxer comfortably defeated Joseph Gonzales of France in the gold medal match and, despite losing his place on the national team following a poor post-Olympic run of results, returned to defend his title in Mexico City.  In 1996 he became an adviser on sporting matters to President Yeltsin. Toby Gibson turned professional after the Games but quit after five fights to go to law school. He became a prosecutor and ran for a Superior Court judgeship but was disbarred after misappropriating his clients’ funds. He later served time in jail for armed robbery. Denmark’s Tom Bogs, who was defeated in the quarter finals, became one of his country’s most popular sportsmen although he failed in an attempt to become world light-heavyweight champion as a professional.

In their absence, Dombrowski was the heavy favorite, especially as the next best European jumper, Nenad Stekić (YUG), was injured and could not compete either. In their absence, Dombrowski won easily. His series was quite impressive, and would have made things very difficult for Myricks or Lewis. His winning mark was 8.54 (28-0¼) – the second legal mark over 28 feet, but he also jumped 8.34 (27-4½), 8.32 (27-3¾), 8.21 (26-11¼), and 8.15 (26-9), with one foul.

In addition, there was now a qualifying round which advanced six teams to the finals. The qualifying score were then discarded and only the final round scores counted towards the final placements.
Romania had been a power in team all-around since the mid-1970s, winning the silver medal behind the Soviet Union in 1976, 1980, 1988, and 1992, but they had only won the gold medal in 1984, when the Soviets boycotted. However, Romania had won the 1997 and 1999 World Championships, with Russia second both times, and in Sydney, the Romanians finally defeated the Russians/Soviets at the Olympics, winning the gold medal in a desparately close contest. Russia had led in the qualifying round, but Romania surpassed them in the finals for the gold.
China appeared to win the bronze medal, with the United States fourth. However, when one of the Chinese gymnasts, Dong Fangxiao, entered for the 2008 Olympics, her date of birth was listed as 25 January 1986 on the entry form, which would have made her 14-years-old in 2000, and two years too young to compete.

The only minor surprise in round one was that Max Schmid (SUI) did not advance.  He was 1920 European Champion.  But the favorites were Jack Beresford, Jr., who had won the Diamond Sculls in 1920, Hadfield d’Arcy, who had won the singles at the 1919 Inter-Allied Games, and Jack Kelly, who had won the U.S. National Championship in the single sculls in 1919 and 1920.
Kelly had been denied entry to the 1920 Diamond Sculls, and the usual description of this denial is that the stewards at Henley denied his entry on the grounds that his profession, bricklaying, made him a laborer and not a true amateur.  Actually, the denial was because Henley would not accept an entry from his club, the Vesper Boat Club of Philadelphia, because of alleged professionalism among the club when they last competed in 1905.  Jack Kelly is considered the greatest sculler ever produced in the United States, and his children also became quite well known.  His son, Jack, Jr., also competed in the Olympics, from 1948-60, winning a bronze medal in the 1956 single sculls.  His daughter, Grace Kelly, became a model and a famous movie star in the 1950s, before leaving her career to marry Prince Grimaldi of Monaco, becoming Princess Grace.
Awaiting Kelly in the final was the man usually considered the greatest sculler ever produced in Britain, Jack Beresford.  Antwerp was Beresford’s first Olympic appearance, but he competed through 1936, winning five medals in all: singles silver in 1920, singles gold in 1924, eights silver in 1928, coxless fours gold in 1932, and double sculls gold in 1936.  At Henley, Beresford won the Diamond Sculls four times (1920, 1924-26), the Nickalls Challenge Cup in coxless pairs in 1928-29, and the Double Sculls Challenge Cup in 1939.  He also won the Wingfield Sculls for seven consecutive years, beginning in 1920.
Kelly defeated d’Arcy in the semi-finals in a close race, not pulling away until 50 metres from the finish, while Beresford had an easier time of it with Holland’s Frits Eyken.  The much-awaited final did not disappoint.  Beresford took the early lead and held it until a few hundred metres from the finish when Kelly caught him and held on to win by one second.  The Field noted that the final was one of the greatest sculling races ever contested.

They had been 1-2 at the last four World Championships, with Davis and White winning in 2011 and 2013, and Virtue and Moir winning in 2010 and 2012. But Davis and White had not lost since the 2012 World Championships and came to Sochi as slight favorites. Making things more interesting was that they both were coached by former Russian Marina Zouyeva, and trained at the same rink in Detroit.
The ice dancing event was changed for the 2014 Olympics. Previously dancers had completed an original set dance and either 1, 2, or 3 compulsory dances (one since 2002), and then a free dance. But making the event consistent with the other figure skating events, the competition had been changed since Vancouver and now consisted of a short dance and a free dance. This format had been in place in all ISU events since Vancouver so the ice dancers were prepared for it.
As expected Davis/White and Virtue/Moir went 1-2 in the short dance, with the Americans taking a slight lead. The little known Russian couple Yelena Ilyinykh and Nikita Katsalapov, silver medalists at the 2012 and 2013 European Championships, was in third place. In the free dance, Davis/White skated to Scheherazade and edged out Virtue/Moir both in that phase and for the gold medal. As always with ice dancing, there was little to choose between them and the results seemed pre-determined. There was some mild controversy that this was the case and that there had even been a deal between American and Russian judges with a quid pro quo between the pairs and dance competition, but this went nowhere quickly. Ilyinykh/Katsalapov won a very surprising bronze medal.

World Bronze had gone to Anže Lanišek of Slovenia, who was champion in the medium hill at the 2012 Winter Youth Olympics.
Another Norwegian, Marius Lindvik, came out on top of the qualifying round, followed by  Johansson and Żyła. Lindvik was the silver medalist in this event at the 2016 Winter Youth Olympics, where he had also taken silver with the cross-country skiing / ski jumping / Nordic combined team. Geiger and Lanišek placed 9th and 15th respectively.
The field after the first round of the final was entirely different and was led by Ryoyu Kobayashi of Japan, who had been fourth in qualifying. Kobayashi was seventh in this event in 2018, but had since seen considerable success at the World Cup, and thus his strength in Beijing was not a complete surprise. Second was Slovenia’s Peter Prevc, the runner-up at the 2014 Sochi Olympics, while Kamil Stoch of Poland was third. Stoch was the 2014 Olympic champion in this event, the 2014 and 2018 large hill champion, and a bronze medalist from the 2018 team event. In 2019, he had been World runner-up in the normal hill. Lanišek was 9th, while none of the other favorites made the top ten.
In the second round, Kobayashi managed to rank fifth overall, but it was sufficient to maintain his hold on gold. The winner of this final jump was Austria’s Manuel Fettner, who slid into silver medal position after weaker performances from Prev and Stoch that saw them rank 8th and 13th respectively in the round and 4th and 6th overall. Dawid Kubacki, the 2019 World Champion who had been only eighth in the first round, came back with a second-ranked jump that allowed him to capture the bronze medal.

It was expected that this class would follow many others at the 1980 Olympic Games and develop into a clash between Eastern Europe and Cuba. The fighter that conspired to upset the applecart was a 20-year-old from Uganda whose main claim to fame was a silver medal at the World Junior Championships. John Mugabi blazed a path of destruction in the early rounds and knocked out his first three opponents to reach the semi-final. On the other side of the draw Andres Aldama of Cuba was emulating Mugabi with the exception of a hard fought points win over Israyel Hakobkokhyan of the USSR. The two men then had contrasting semi-final wins. Aldama comfortably outpointed his East German opponent but Mugabi only advanced on a 3-2 decision over Kazimierz Szczerba of Poland although it must be pointed that the two dissenting voters were both from Warsaw Pact countries. The two big hitters faced off in the final where the greater experience of the Cuban, who was in his second Olympic final, negated the raw power of the Ugandan. For Aldama this was the pinnacle of his career and he never achieved the same sort of success gain. Mugabi went on to be a popular and charismatic addition to the professional scene.

At the 2009 World Championships, Bolt won all three titles, and was considered by many as the greatest sprinter in history. But 2011 and early 2012 had not been as strong for him as he struggled with injury problems. At the 2011 World Championships, he false started in the final of the 100 and was disqualified, the title going to his countryman, Yohan Blake. Blake had beaten Bolt one other time in the 100, at the 2012 Jamaican Olympic Trials, and was considered a strong challenger to his title in London. Also challenging the two Jamaicans were Americans Tyson Gay and Justin Gatlin. Gay was the 2007 World Champion at both 100 and 200 metres, but hip injuries had since limited his effectiveness. Gatlin had won the gold medal in this event at the 2004 Olympics, but later had a doping positive and had only returned to competition in 2011.
All four of the favorites made the finals, where they were joined by the third Jamaican, Asafa Powell, former world record hold in the event, but one who seemed to struggle in the biggest international meets; the third American, up-and-comer Ryan Bailey; Dutch runner Churandy Martina, who had formerly competed for the Netherlands Antilles, before the dissolution of that nation in 2010; and Trinidadian Richard Thompson.
The final had an early problem when cretinous spectator Ashley Gill-Webb of Leeds threw a beer bottle onto the track just before the race was to start. Gill-Webb did not know he was seated next to Dutch Olympian judoka Edith Bosch, who quickly subdued him before the authorities arrived to escort him from the stadium. He was later charged with causing harassment, alarm or distress, and pleaded not guilty, although he was found guilty of public disorder in January 2013, and was sentenced to eight weeks of community service in February 2013.
Once the runners were away Gatlin, Blake, Powell, and Gay were out quickly, as Bolt is not known for his starts. But this was better than usual for him and he was in the lead by 40 metres. Powell pulled up from a groin pull although he would finish the race, barely and in last place. In the final 40 metres Bolt pulled away to win in 9.63, the second-fastest time ever, with Blake trailing for silver in 9.75, and Gatlin getting bronze in 9.79. Gay just missed the medals in fourth in 9.80.
Bolt became the third man to defend his Olympic 100 metres title, after Archie Hahn in 1904-06, and Carl Lewis in 1984-88. But both came with an asterisk as Hahn had the always-present 1906 problem, while Lewis only won in 1988 after the disqualification of Ben Johnson for stanozolol use. A few days later, Bolt would also defend his Olympic gold medal in the 200, becoming the first runner ever to defend the 100-200 Olympic double, and he would win three Olympic sprint gold medals, leading Jamaica to a world-record in the 400 relay in London.

Final round only.,na,"Chen Ruolin won the Olympic title in 2008 and 2012 with different partners and was hoping to make it a unique treble by winning it with yet another partner, Liu Huixia, the 2014 FINA Female Diver of the Year. They teamed up after the 2012 London Olympics and had won all 17 events they subsequently entered, including the 2013 and 2015 World Championship and the World Cup in 2014 and 2016. Any threat to China’s domination of this event, which has seen them win all four Olympic golds since it was first held in 2000, was probably going to come from the strong Canadian duo of Meaghan Benfeito and Roseline Filion, bronze medalists in London 2012 and silver medalists behind Huixia and Ruolin in the Worlds in both 2013 and 2015. This was their third Olympics together.
True to form, and like their male counterparts the night before, the Chinese pair led from start to finish to win gold, but one thing was different from the men’s win - the girls were diving into green water! Mysteriously the colour of the water changed from clear blue to green overnight and as the competition progressed it got darker and murkier, but it did not put the competitors off and the event was not disrupted.
The threat to the Chinese did indeed come from the Canadian pair, and also the Malaysia duo of Cheong Jun Hoong and Pandela Rinong, who tied second place with the Canadians after the first two rounds and then pulled away on their own after round three when the North Koreans Kim Kuk-Hyang and Kim Mi-Rae dived into the bronze medal position with the best dive of the round. Going into the final round Great Britain had moved up to fourth place ahead of the Canadians after their best dive, but it all changed in the final round. The Chinese pair saved their best dive for last, scoring 87.36 and guaranteeing first place, while the Malyasian duo also had their best dive of the night to get silver, and Malaysia’s first of the Games. It was also a second medal for Pandelela Rinong to add to the individual bronze she won in the 10-metre platform event in 2012. The bronze was still to be won and poor 60+ point dives by the Korean and British girls allowed the Canadians to leapfrog them into third place with a score of 80.64 on their final dive.
For China it was continued domination of the event and, in all synchronised women’s events, they had won nine of the 10 golds since inception in 2000. For Chen Roulin it was a personal milestone as she became only the second diver, make or female, after team-mate Wu Minxia two days earlier, to win a record five Olympic gold medals as she continued her amazing run of winning every major synchronised 10-metre title since 2006.

Previously, Korea’s best, and only, result at the Olympics was an eighth place four years ago in Sochi. At the World Championships of 2012 and 2014 they finished fourth on each occasion.
All team members of the 2018 team were centered around skip Kim Eun-Jung and had the surname Kim, with two of them being sisters. They all came from the town of Uiseong, which is particularly famous for its garlic. All of the squad started curling twelve years ago, when a curling center opened in their hometown. The first senior appearance together was at the World’s at Beijing in 2017, when they placed sixth.
In PyeongChang, however, Korea played an outstanding round robin series, winning eight of nine games, including victories against highly favored teams like Canada (2014 gold medalists and 2017 World Champions), Sweden (2014 silver medalist), “Olympic Athletes from Russia” (2017 second at the World’s), Great Britain, and the United States. Korea’s only defeat was a narrow 5-7 loss to Asian rivals Japan. The hosts were carried through the tournament on a rising wave of patriotism by their fans in the stands, and throughout the country. The other two semi-finalists were not major surprises: Sweden had won two gold and one silver medal in the least three Olympics, Great Britain (Scotland) won bronze at Sochi 2014 and also at the 2017 World Championships, and the other country making up the last four, Japan, had picked up the silver medal at the 2016 World Championships. Clearly disappointing in the round robin series were Canada (sixth) and Switzerland (seventh), both with four wins and 5 losses.
In their semi-final, Korea managed to take revenge for the defeat in the round robin, and defeated Japan in an extremely narrow game, 8-7, scoring the decisive point in an extra end. In the other semi-final, Sweden outscored Great Britain 10-5 after nine ends. In the final, Sweden gave the South Koreans no chance, as they won their third gold medal in women’s team curling, after 2006 and 2010, with an 8-3 victory after nine ends, leading the host nation to concede. The Swedish team, led by skip Anna Hasselborg, gradually increased their lead and, after scoring three points in the seventh end, the game was virtually over. In the last two ends, Sweden just had to defend the attacks of their opponents to secure the gold. Even though only one member of the Swedish team, Agnes Knochenhauer, had the experience of competing in the World Championship and Olympic Games, they could obviously handle the pressure of an Olympic final much better than their Korean opponents.
After a thrilling bronze medal game Japan, with skip Satsuki Fujisawa, surprisingly took the bronze medal. Great Britain had victory in their grasp, but skip Eve Muirhead spoiled the last stone, so the bronze went to the underdogs, 5-3.

The world’s greatest male gymnast in 1984 was Soviet Dmitry Bilozerchev who had won the 1983 World Championships at only 16-years-old. His routines were so difficult that he was already being spoken of as perhaps the greatest gymnast ever. But he could not compete in Los Angeles, nor could any Soviet. Japan’s Koji Gushiken had been runner-up to Bilozerchev at the 1983 Worlds and was favored in Los Angeles, but Gushiken qualified only fifth, slightly behind the USA’s Peter Vidmar, who led the qualifying. However, Gushiken posted the highest score in the final round to come back and win the gold medal, with Vidmar taking silver, while China’s Li Ning won the bronze medal. Li would later light the torch at the Opening Ceremony of the 2008 Olympics in Beijing.
Bilozerchev would also win the 1985 European Championships but shortly after that title, shattered his left leg in a motorcycle accident while driving drunk. Amputation was considered but the leg was saved by using an Ilizarov device, an orthopaedic treatment pioneered by Siberian orthopaedist Gavriil Ilizarov, who practiced in Kurgan. Bilozerchev’s recovery was long and difficult but in 1988 he won a bronze medal in the Olympic all-around.

Behind Nowicki, Ukraine’s Mykhaylo Kokhan threw 80.39 in round two to move into second place. He would hold that position until round five when Fajdek threw 81.53 and Norway’s Eivind Henriksen recorded 81.58, a mark that would bring him the silver medal as only Britain’s Nick Miller would improve in round six, finishing sixth. Winkler never contended, his best throw of 77.08 coming in round one as he finished seventh. Fajdek took bronze and Kokhan was just off the podium in fourth.

In the medal race, Stipanović tried from the start to outrace Burton, his last remaining pursuer for gold. But he eventually finished at the back of the fleet in ninth place, which added another 18 points to his total. Burton sailed to a third place in the medal race and his six points gave him the top position and the gold medal, two points ahead of the Croatian. Nevertheless, Stipanović, who finished fourth at the London Olympics, won the first ever sailing medal for his country.
In the preliminaries, none of the boats in this close field managed to win two races. However, 43-year-old veteran Robert Scheidt of Brazil was first in the second preliminary race and also won the medal race. But some 20+ rankings dashed all his hopes to do better than fourth. In his six Olympic appearances since 1996, it was the first time Scheidt went home without a medal after two gold, two silver and one bronze. Sam Meech from New-Zealand, who was already third after the preliminaries, held on to the bronze medal position by placing fourth in the medal race.

Lee and Wang went on to face China’s Li Junhui and Liu Yuchen in the final, the latter of whom had emerged victorious over the Malaysian pair. Once again, however, the Taiwanese duo had control of the match and took the gold medal with relative ease, becoming the first Taiwanese Olympic medallists in badminton (Tai Tzu-ying would take silver in the women’s singles the following day).

307143,"Kayak Doubles, 500 metres, Women",2012 Summer Olympics,54,Canoe Sprint,/editions/54/sports/CSP,7 –  8 August 2012,"Eton Dorney, Windsor",34 from 17 countries,na,na,"As holders of the last two Olympic titles, Hungarians Katalin Kovács and Natasa Douchev-Janics were the team to beat in the women’s K-2 500 at the 2012 Summer Olympics and each had an outstanding record in sprint canoeing. Douchev-Janics was also the winner of the K-1 500 at the 2004 Olympics and had a silver medal from the K-4 500 in 2008, but her record at the World Championships was even more impressive: 22 medals, 18 of which were gold, since 2002. She had taken 2011 off while pregnant, but returned in full form the following season, winning the K-1 and K-2 500m at the 2012 European Championships. Astonishingly, however, Douchev-Janics’ record paled in comparison to her partner’s: Kovács had six Olympics medals, two gold and four silver, and 40 medals, 31 of them gold, at the World Championships, spanning back to 1998. Her pace had not slowed in recent years either, as she had earned two gold medals at the most recent World Championships and three more at the 2011 European Championships. The German duo of Franziska Weber and Tina Dietze had shown some promise in recent years and were perhaps best poised to challenge their canoeing rivals, the Hungarians. They were runners-up in the K-2 500 at the most recent World Championships, losing to the Austrians, but had had a strong season in the lead up the Olympics, whereas the Austrian duo of Yvonne Schuring and Vicki Schwarz had waned somewhat.
A surprise came in the heats when the unknown Chinese team of Wu Yanan and Zhou Yu posted a time of over half a second faster than the Hungarians. The Chinese team were held back to a still-impressive third-fastest time in the semi-finals, while the Hungarians were outclassed once again, this time by the Germans. In the finals, Weber and Dietze held nothing back and led through the entire race, with the Hungarians unable to match them at any point in the course. The Germans thus broke Kovács and Douchev-Janics’ streak in this event, getting their revenge on Kovács who, with her squad, had earned the Olympic K-4 500 title the day before, which had been held by the Germans since 1996. Hungary was forced to settle for sliver while Poland, paddled by Karolina Naja and Beata Mikołajczyk, edged out China for the bronze by 0.136 seconds. It was Naja’s first Olympic medal and a second for Mikołajczyk, who had been runner up in the event in 2008 alongside Aneta Pastuszka-Konieczna.

1434,"Downhill, Men1",1998 Winter Olympics,46,Alpine Skiing,/editions/46/sports/ALP,13 February 1998 — 11:00,"Happo'one, Hakuba (Olympic Course I)",43 from 18 countries,na,IFR,"The biggest story in the 1998 men’s downhill was the controversy over the course. After a test event had been held there the skiers felt that it was too short for a championship downhill. They requested that the start be moved higher up the mountain, but the Japanese organizers demurred, stating that this would take the course into an environmentally protected region. The Fédération Internationale de Ski (FIS) countered that many recreational skiers used that area and could not understand why the Olympic skiers could not race there as well. Eventually a compromise was reached with the course lengthened slightly. In fact, at a length of 3,289 metres, it became the longest men’s downhill in Olympic history.
However, starting the 1998 Olympic downhill was anything but easy, as the event, traditionally the first Alpine event at the Olympics, had to be postponed three times because of weather. It did not start until five days after it was scheduled. Though the course was not felt to be difficult, that failed to take into consideration the 7th turn, which caused 14 of the 15 non-finishers to fall or miss the turn, leading to their disqualification. France’s Jean-Luc Crétier was the third skier out of the starthouse, and posted the fastest time to that point. As contender after contender, including Austrian Hermann “The Herminator” Maier, met their fate on the seventh turn, Crétier’s time held up for the gold medal. Crétier was also helped by the absence of his former teammate, Luc Alphand. Alphand was World Cup champion in 1997 in the overall, the downhill, and the Super G, but he then abruptly retired and turned his attention to race-car driving. In 2006 he won the Dakar Rally, a year after placing second in that cross-country race.

These 11 teams were joined by host country Great Britain, which had very little volleyball background, never before having appeared in the sport at the Olympics, and they failed to win a set in five pool matches.
Coming into London, Brazil, Russia, and Italy were seeded 1-2-3 in the FIVB standings. Italy would struggle, barely getting out of its pool, but in the quarter-finals, it crushed the defending champions, the sixth-seeded United States, 3-0, which had actually won Pool B over Brazil and Russia. Both Brazil and Russia had straight-set quarter-final victories, and easily advanced to the final, Russia beating Bulgaria, 3-1, and Brazil with another straight-set victory over Italy.
The final was closely fought, with Brazil winning the first two sets and narrowly missing straight-set victory as Russia won the third set 29-27. Russia won the fourth set 25-22, and them comfortably closed out the tournament 15-9 in the final set to win the gold medal. It was the fourth consecutive volleyball medal for the Russian men, but their first gold, although the USSR had won three golds (1964, 1968, 1980) and six Olympic medals. For Brazil it was their fifth Olympic medal for the men, all since 1984, with their third silver added to golds won in 1992 and 2004. This gave them five Olympic medals, trailing only the six won by the former Soviet Union and equalling the United States’ five. Brazil’s two Olympic golds trails only the Soviet Union’s and United States’ three.
The third-seeded Italians defeated Bulgaria, 3-1, to win the bronze medal. This was the fifth Olympic medal for Italian men in volleyball, but they were yet to win gold, with silvers in 1996 and 2004, and bronzes in 1984, 2000, and 2012.

With the USSR not present, the biggest challenges to the United States were considered to be Spain, Italy, and Yugoslavia.
But the absence of the Soviet Union probably did not affect the final outcome as the United States 1984 Olympic basketball team rivaled the United States 1960 team as a great amateur unit. The team was coached by the controversial Bob Knight, then of Indiana University, and was never challenged in winning the gold medal. It was led by Michael Jordan of the University of North Carolina, who would later be considered the greatest professional player ever. The team members were Steve Alford, Leon Wood, Patrick Ewing, Vern Fleming, Alvin Robertson, Michael Jordan, Joe Kleine, Jon Koncak, Wayman Tisdale, Chris Mullin, Sam Perkins, and Jeff Turner. Ewing, Jordan, and Mullin would also later play on the 1992 Dream Team. The US team won their games by an average of 32 points per game. Spain won the silver medal and Yugoslavia the bronze medal.

The Dragon was superseded in 1976 by the Soling, which became the three-person keelboat class for several Olympics.
Racing on the Alpha course, the Dragon event was delayed for several days for various reasons and eventually, only six races could be competed. There was no wind on 5 September, the Games were suspended on 6 September because of the Israeli Massacre back in München, and heavy fog prevented racing on 7 September, causing the sixth, and what would be, final race to be pushed back to 8 September. The outcome would almost certainly not have been different as Australian skipper John Cuneo won the first three races, and then finished third in race five and fourth in race six to comfortably win the gold medal. One of his crew members was Tom Anderson, the identical twin brother of John Anderson, who was winning a gold medal in the Star Class on the Bravo course, at the same time Tom was winning gold in this event.

The course was roughly the same as in 1896, measuring this time about 41,860 metres. The Greeks hoped to duplicate the finish of 1896, when Spyridon Louis had provided the home crowd with a Greek winner. In preparation, the Greeks held a trial race on 17 March 1906, from which they selected their Olympic marathoners. The race was won by Anastasios Koutoulakis, with Dimitrios Kantzias second. Although he had finished second, Kantzias was noted to be the Greek favorite.
The marathoners were transported to Marathon the day before the race (30 April [17 April]) and spent the night at the residence of Foreign Minister Skouzes. The route was staffed at one mile intervals with five soldiers, who were enlisted to provide medical supervision. Ambulances, military surgeons, nurses, and stretchers were available at five mile intervals. The route was kept clear by police, assisted by a battalion of infantry, two squadrons of cavalry, and one of gendermerie. The head timekeeper was a lieutenant of the cavalry who rode at the head of the pack, and changed his mount four times.
The 1906 Olympic marathon race started at 3:05 PM (1505) on 1 May [18 April], a very warm day (27° C. [81° F.]). The starter was G. Karamaliklis. The early lead was held by George Blake (AUS) and William  Frank (USA). At about 25 km., Billy Sherring of Canada passed both runners and dominated the remainder of the race, winning by almost seven minutes. As he passed within two miles of the stadium, a cannon was fired at the Rizarian School to notify the spectators in the Panathenaic Stadium.
When Sherring finished, the disappointment of the Greek crowd was almost palpable, but Prince George greeted him at the stadium entrance and, reminiscent of Louis and 1896, ran with him the entire way to the finish. Sherring finished the race carrying his shoes in his hands. Following Sherring was another foreigner, John Svanberg of Sweden, a well-known distance runner in his native country, who passed Frank near the stadium to finish second. Frank held on to get third place. Blake fell back to finish sixth.
One athlete who did not finish was the Italian, Dorando Pietri, who in 1908 would be involved in the most famous finish in Olympic marathon history when, near collapse, he was helped across the line by the British Olympic officials. He would be disqualified.
The Canadians had tried to send two marathoners, Sherring, and Jack Caffrey, who had twice beaten Sherring in the past year in Canadian distance races. But the proposal to raise money by a civic fund in Hamilton was vetoed by the City Council, and a public concert turned up only $75, not nearly enough for the trip for either man. Sherring was given the money and, on a tip from a bartender, William “Butch” Collier, bet it on a racehorse named Cicely, at six-to-one. Cicely won and Sherring had enough money to go to Athens. He went to Athens over two months early and trained continually on the road between Marathon and Athens. During his stay in Greece, he lost over 20 pounds from his voracious training. One newspaper report of his training noted, “Word was received here today that Sherring, the famous Hamilton sprinter, broke all records in a trial run over the Marathon course at Athens, and will go faster on the day of the race.”

They lost their first round heat badly, placing third behind Germany and South Africa. They then lost their repêchage heat to Czechoslovakia, and were forced into a re-run repêchage race, where they defeated the United States and Germany to make the quarters. In the finals, they got revenge on South Africa to make the semi-finals, where they were joined by Italy, Czechoslovakia, and Great Britain. The Italian pair of Giuseppe Ogna and Cesare Pinarello was considered to have a slight edge – Pinarello had won bronze in this event in 1952 with Antonio Maspes. But the Australians ousted them in the semi-finals and again met the Czechoslovakian pair of Ladislav Fouček and Václav Machek in the final. In the final Browne and Marchant surprised the Czechs by starting their sprint before the last lap, and could not be caught as they won the gold.

The winner was the Italian Alberto Braglia, who had been runner-up in both individual events at the 1906 Olympics in Athens. An article in a Birmingham newspaper noted that Braglia “scored 16 points in the rope climb and 67 of a maximum 72 on the pommel horse.”
Braglia used his Olympic fame to become a circus performer. Working on a trapeze, he sustained a serious injury from a fall in 1910. But he recovered from that setback to return in 1912 at Stockholm, where he defended his Olympic title in individual gymnastics. He then turned professional, returning to the circus as an acrobat. Braglia later returned to gymnastics and coached the Italian team at the 1932 Olympics.
Full results of this event were not available until March 2020, and were not originally published in the Mallon/Buchanan book The 1908 Olympic Games: Results for All Competitors in All Events, with Commentary (McFarland, 2000). Hilary Evans, one of the OlyMADMen, discovered them in an obscure French newspaper/journal Les Jeunes : courrier de quinzaine du journal “Le Patronage”, the journal of the Fédération sportive et culturelle de France from 8 August 1908. They can be seen here.
The late Ian Buchanan once said that “we would find them [1908 individual gymnastics results] somewhere - perhaps in somebody’s attic.” Ian is certainly smiling down upon us, knowing that the full results of the 1908 Olympics are now complete with the addition of these results.
