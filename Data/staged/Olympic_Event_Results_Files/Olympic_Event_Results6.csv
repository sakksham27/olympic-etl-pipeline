The Finns were still favored, led by Lauri Lehtinen, who had broken Paavo Nurmi’s world record in June at the Finnish Olympic Trials, with Lauri “Lasse” Virtanen also highly considered. In the final Lehtinen and Virtanen opened up quickly and pushed the pace from the beginning. By 4,000 metres they led with only America’s Ralph Hill in contact, but Virtanen dropped off the pace shortly thereafter. Hill and Lehtinen reached the bell lap together. On the final lap, Lehtinen led slightly until the home stretch. At that point, Hill moved to the second lane to try to pass Lehtinen but Lehtinen also moved out, blocking Hill. Hill then tried to move inside, but Lehtinen cut back and blocked that move as well. They crossed the line with Lehtinen leading by 30 cm. The pro-American crowd went crazy over the Finns move in the final straight, and Coliseum announcer Bill Henry finally had to quiet them with, “Ladies and gentlemen, please remember, these people are our guests.” Films of the race seemed to show that Lehtinen had interfered with Hill but no protest was lodged. Hill later graciously commented that although he had been blocked, he felt Lehtinen had enough reserve to win the race in any case. On the victory podium, Lehtinen tried to make amends by pulling Hill up to the top step, although he refused. Lehtinen did pin a Finnish flag on his sweater during the victory ceremony.

Qi Guangpu (3) and Jia Zongyang (2) of China were the only others to have captured more than one. Belarus also had Dmitry Dashchinsky, who won bronze and silver at the 1998 and 2006 Olympics respectively and was runner-up at two World Championships in 2001 and 2007. The defending Olympic champion was Han Xiaopeng of China. Jia was the top qualifier in the initial round, and disastrous second jumps from Kushnir and Han left them out of contention for this finals.
North America had dominated the podium at the 2009 World Championships, with Ryan St. Onge of the United States and Steve Omischl and Warren )Wookie) Shouldice of Canada claiming the top three spots, but all had problematic first runs in the finals, leaving them unlikely to medal.

Elmer Niklander defeated his compatriot and the world record holder, Armas Taipale.  Four days earlier, Niklander had finished second in the shot put.

She had won the 1986 Europeans and the 1987 World Championships.

In that race, run against a field of world-class competitors, she lapped every runner. But in 1988 she was battling a foot injury and she eventually dropped out of the final, after leading the first seven laps. That left a stunned field to battle for the medals. After her withdrawal, the lead was taken by Liz McColgan (GBR), Kathrin Ullrich (GDR), Yelena Zhupiyeva (URS), and Olga Bondarenko (URS). Ullrich led at 5K, but McColgan then pushed the pace and Ullrich could not maintain it after 8,000 metres. Zhupiyeva hung on until 9K, but the race then came down to McColgan and Bondarenko. With 200 left, Bondarenko pushed past McColgan and pulled away from her for the gold medal.

Murphy’s win gave him the 100-200 backstroke double, and was the sixth consecutive victory in the event for the United States.

The Ordinal Placement for each judge was based on Total Points awarded by that judge to the skaters.  The points were based on 60% for Compulsory Figures and 40% for Free Skating.  Final placement was determined by a Majority Placement rule.  Thus, if a skater was ranked first by a majority of the judges, that skater was placed first overall, and the process was repeated for each place.  If no absolute majority for a place existed, the tiebreakers were, in order: 1) Total Ordinals, 2) Total Points, 3) Compulsory Figure Points.",na,"Ulrich Salchow opened a large lead in the school figures.  Although his countryman, Richard Johansson, defeated him in the free skating, it was not by a sufficient margin to prevent Salchow from winning the gold medal.  Nikolay Panin was second after the compulsory figures, but withdrew before the free skating.  Various reasons are given for the withdrawal, with two main possibilities: 1) he was upset at the judging which gave Salchow the lead, and 2) he became ill and was unable to continue.
Salchow was the dominant figure skater of the era.  He was World Champion in 1901-1905, and 1907-1911.  He did not compete in 1906, the only year of the decade in which he failed to win the title.  In his career, Salchow also won nine European championships - 1898-1900, 1904, 1906-1907, 1909-1910, and 1913.  He retired after 1913 but returned for the 1920 Olympics, finishing fourth, before retiring for good.  He is today remembered by the popular figure skating jump termed the Salchow, in which the skater takes off from the back inside edge of one foot and lands backwards on the outside edge of the opposite foot.  He also served as President of the International Skating Union from 1925-1937.

As the first major international competition of the year, it was difficult to pick a favorite. The Finns had been training in Davos prior to coming to Chamonix, and Clas Thunberg had posted 43.8 there, four tenths slower than Oscar Mathisen’s World Record. The American Olympic Team contested metric events at Saranac Lake prior to leaving for Europe, the fastest sprinter being Charley Jewtraw with 46.6. But as an indication of his speed, Jewtraw had also set a new World Record in the 100 yard (9.4) on January 6th. Fastest Norwegian had been Roald Larsen with 44.6 at Frogner, and with Oskar Olsen they had one of the fastest Europeans on their team.
The very first pair in Olympic speed skating history saw Joe Moore of the U.S. paired with Eric Blomgren of Sweden, the former clocking 45.6 as the first Olympic Record. Moore’s time went unchallenged until the 11th pair, when Asser Wallenius (44.4 in Davos) stopped the clock at 45 seconds, only to see it improved with 8 tenths by Oskar Olsen in the next race. Defending World Champion Thunberg was unable to beat this time with 44.8. Two North Americans contested pair 15, Charles Jewtraw and Charlie Gorman. The Canadian took the lead, but was soon overtaken by Jewtraw, who held on to the end: 44.0. The only remaining favorite, Larsen, had to skate against a much slower opponent, and also timed 44.8, tying for third place with Clas Thunberg.
Jewtraw had been a top skater in the short distances in the early 1920s. Coming from a poor family, speed skating was expensive, but Jewtraw was “sponsored” by Lake Placid businessman Jack Mabbit. He grew to become one of the fastest skaters in the very short distances, which were primarily contested in North America. He had already retired by the 1924 Olympics, but made a comeback to get a ticket to France. After the gold medal, he skated two more Olympic races before retiring once more.

Abdvali was the overwhelming favorite to win gold at the 2012 Games despite the return of France’s Steeve Guénot, the defending Olympic champion, as Guénot had not reached the podium in the World Championships since his Olympic victory. Abdvali and Guénot met during the quarterfinals, where the Frenchman defeated the Iranian in a controversial match that saw Abdvali lose the first round to penalty fouls after a successful par terre defense and the second after a successful par terre offense that was discounted after it was deemed too low on the body. While the replay showed that Abdvali was indeed too low in the second round, many Iranians felt that the referee and the match judge were unfairly penalizing Abdvali while ignoring fouls committed by Guénot.
Abdvali was denied any chance at a medal when Guénot lost to Kim Hyeon-Wu, a bronze medalist from the 2011 World Championships, in the semi-finals. In the final Kim faced Lőrincz, where Kim was nearly flipped in the first round par terre, although he maintained his defense to take the period. The second par terre was more decisive, and Kim used his top advantage to score two points on the Hungarian and capture the Olympic crown.
The first bronze medal bout was contested by Manuchar Tskhadaia of Georgia, a two-time runner up at the World Championships (2009 and 2011), and Frank Stäbler of Germany, the 2012 European Champion. Tskhadaia successfully defended a first round par terre before taking the second period, and the bronze medal, by scoring on Stäbler early in the round and withstanding the German’s aggressive onslaught for the remainder of the period. For the final podium spot Guénot faced Pedro Mulens of Cuba, a two-time World Championship bronze medalist (2009 and 2011). The Frenchman immediately asserted his dominance with a four-point takedown to win the first round and then maintained a more defensive attitude in the second to bring the period to par terre. Taking advantage of his top position, Guénot lifted the Cuban from the ground and tossed him out of the ring, earning him his second Olympic medal.

This meant the final pool match between the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia was decisive: if the Soviets won by four or more goals, they would reach the final. The home nation pulled off that feat (22-17), helped by goalkeeper Mykola Tomin, who stopped five penalty shots.
The final, between the second and third finishers at the World Championships, was as close as could be expected.

The International Hockey Federation was initially opposed to this, but the Canadians claimed they would be unable to offer quality natural grass pitches for the entire tournament. Nowadays, all international matches are played on artificial surfaces. The number of participating nations had been cut back from 16 to 12, and was further reduced when Kenya joined the African boycott. Great Britain had lost to Belgium for the final qualifying position. Ghana was the next African team after Kenya, but they had played very poorly in qualifying so Britain was offered the spot when Kenya announced they would withdraw. However, Kenya did not notify the IOC of their withdrawal in time so the Fédération Internationale de Hockey (FIH) elected to play the tournament with only 11 teams. The British team was actually at Heathrow Airport when they heard the news, preparing to leave for Montreal, but they had to return to their homes.
The tournament had many upsets. 1975 World Champion India did not make the semi-finals, and neither did defending Olympic Champion West Germany. Oceanian nations Australia and New Zealand did make the cut, along with hockey powerhouses Pakistan and the Netherlands. The latter team had been unbeaten in pool play, and heavily underestimated their semi-final opponents, New Zealand. After three overtime periods, the Kiwis scored the winning goal from a penalty corner. The other country from “down under”, Australia, also upset their opponents 2-1, to make for a completely unexpected final line-up. This was even more surprising as the artificial turf was assumed to be an advantage to technically superior teams. The final was a rather boring affair, with Tony Ineson scoring the only goal on a penalty corner.

Dashchinsky took a narrow lead over Han in the first round of the final, with Nissen still struggling, placing eighth. Nissen had the best jump in the second round of the final with his back-full double-full-full, but his poor first jump kept him only in fifth place. Han placed fourth in the second round with Dashchinsky fifth, but Han was able to edge ahead of the Belarussian and win the gold medal, with the bronze going to Russian Vladimir Lebedev. This was a major surprise to Dashchinsky. When he landed his final jump, he and the crowd thought he had won, and he was waving a Belarussian flag in triumph, until his score was announced. In 2007, Han won the World Championships, but thru 2009, had still not won a World Cup event. With his gold medal, he became the first Chinese man to win a gold medal at the Winter Olympics.

Yemelin won his first match but in the quarter-finals met Cuban Luis Alberto Orta, who narrowly defeated him, 4-3, on points. Fumita had no such early troubles in making the final, where he met Orta. Orta’s previous international honors were most limited to his region, winning gold at the 2018-19 Pan American Championships and the 2018 Central American and Caribbean Games.
In Tokyo, his lack of major international competition did not hinder Orta, who comfortably handled Fumita in the final, winning on points, 5-1.

These were quite controversial international games, which were organized by Indonesian President Sukarno who proposed the GANEFO in early 1963 to promote the development of sports in new emerging nations so as to cement friendly relations among them.  The problem was that China, DPR Korea (North), and North Vietnam were present, none of which were recognized by several of the IFs organizing sports at GANEFO, notably the IAAF (track & field athletics) and FINA (swimming).  Indonesian athletes also competed, quite naturally, since they hosted the Games.  In response the IOC banned the athletes from Indonesia and DPR Korea who had competed at GANEFO from participating at the 1964 Tokyo Olympics.  (China and North Vietnam could not compete at Tokyo as they did not have recognized NOCs.)  Indonesia and DPR Korea responded by demanding that their athletes be reinstated or their entire teams would boycott the Tokyo Olympics.  The athletes were not reinstated, and the two nations did not compete at Tokyo, which kept out Dan Shin-Geum.
Without Dan the race was wide open. Dixie Willis (AUS) had won the 1962 Commonwealth Games and was the world record holder with 2:01.2 (Dan’s marks were not recognized by the IAAF), but she did not compete because of an injury. France’s Maryvonne Dupureur had the fastest time in round one and the semis, with an Olympic record of 2:04.1 in her semi-final. She led the final from the start, and had a five-metre lead at the top of the homestretch. But she was then run down by Britain’s Ann Packer, who had placed second in the 400 metres, and had superior speed. Packer pulled away to win fairly easily in a world record 2:01.1. Packer almost did not compete. She had been so upset by her 400 silver medal that she wanted to withdraw and go shopping, but her fiancé, British 400 metre runner Robbie Brightwell, convinced her to compete.

The Soviet Union players, however, skated year-round for a national team, and were allowed to compete as amateurs.  After several years of fighting the authorities, Canada withdrew from international amateur ice hockey and did not compete at the 1972 and 1976 Winter Olympics.  Sweden manage a 3-3 tie against the Soviets, but the USSR defeated their other rivals, the United States, 5-1, and Czechoslovakia, 5-2, and won another gold medal.  The United States won the silver medal, their first Olympic ice hockey medal since their upset gold in 1960.  The Soviet team was led by forwards Valery Kharlamov and Aleksandr Yakushev, considered by many hockey experts to be the equal of any players in the NHL.

This was undeniable in the men’s K-1 1000, for the defending Olympic and four-time World Champion Rüdiger Helm of East Germany was absent, as was the most recent runner-up, Artūras Vieta of the Soviet Union. This left three major contenders at the Games: Alan Thompson of New Zealand, the 1982 World runner-up and 1983 bronze medalist, Norway’s Einar Rasmussen, the 1978 World runner-up and 1981 and 1982 bronze medalist, and Vasile Dîba, a four-time Olympic and seven-time World medalist across various disciplines, who was representing 1981 World runner-up Romania.
Of these three men, only Thompson won his heat, with Dîba and Rasmussen coming in third in heats won by France’s Philippe Boccara and Yugoslavia’s Milan Janić, the 1978 World runner-up, respectively. Boccara and Thompson captured their heats in the semi-finals, with the latter helping to eliminate Rasmussen in the process, while Janić and Dîba were second and third behind Great Britain’s Stephen Jackson. In the medal, Thompson won the gold medal without too much difficulty, while Janić had to stave off a challenge from American Greg Barton to win silver with only half of a second to spare. Barton came in for a surprise third-place finish, while Boccara, Dîba, and Jackson were sixth, seventh, and eighth respectively. Thompson would go on to become a double Olympic champion at the Games by helping his nation win the K-4 1000 later in the day.

The overwhelming favorite for the event was Sweden’s Nils van der Poel. A modest performer until 2018, he had taken a break from sports to fulfill his military obligations. Using unorthodox training methods, such as ultrarunning, he made a comeback in the 2020/21 season, and with a huge impact. At the 2021 World Single Distance Championships held in the Heerenveen COVID-19 “bubble”, he won both 5,000 and 10,000 m, the latter in world record time. He continued in that vein in the Olympic season, winning all long distances and bettering the 5,000 m world record.
Competition started with three-time champion Sven Kramer in his fifth Olympic 5,000 m. Plagued by back injuries, he had been happy to qualify for the Dutch Olympic team and with 6:17.04 he would end up in ninth place. In the third pair, Kramer’s Olympic Record was challenged by both Sergey Trofimov and Hallgeir Engebråten, who kept in close contest the entire 12.5 laps. The Norwegian, third at the 2022 Europeans, finished in 6:09.88, just ahead of Trofimov. The last race before the ice preparation break saw one of van der Poel’s toughest opponents, Patrick Roest. The three-time world all-around champion, who was chasing his first international single distance title, produced a good race, although his pace slightly fell back in the final 800 m.
After disappointing showings of former medalists Jorrit Bergsma (6:13.18) and Ted-Jan Bloemen (6:19.11), the final pair featured van der Poel. The Swede produced a very evenly paced race, racing all his laps between 28.97 and 29.33 seconds, but up until the bell, he was trailing Roest’s times. Going into the last lap he was back 0.99 seconds, but made up 1.46 in the last 400 m to earn the first Swedish gold in the sport since Tomas Gustafson in 1988.

At Tokyo, Snell planned to defend his 800 gold medal in attempting the 800/1,500 double. In January 1962, on a grass track in Wanganui, New Zealand, Snell had broken Herb Elliott’s world mile record by 1/10th second, posting 3:54.4.
At Tokyo Snell ran three rounds of the 800 on 14-16 October and comfortably defended his gold medal. He later said that he had held something back for the 1,500. The 1,500 also had three rounds – on the 17th, 19th, and the final on the 21st. Michel Bernard led the final on the first lap, as he had in Roma, but the pace of the final was not fast. The leader at 1,200 was Snell’s teammate, John Davies, who passed the start in 2:59.3. Suddenly Snell shot ahead with a startling burst of speed on the backstretch, and the race was over. He ran the next two 100 metre splits in 12.3 and 12.7, distancing the field. Slowing slightly coming home, he won by almost 15 metres in 3:38.1. He ran his last 300 in 38.6, and last 400 in 52.7. Czechoslovakia’s Josef Odložil finished second and Davies got the bronze medal. Later in November 1964, Snell again broke the world record with 3:54.1 in a race in Auckland.

Thus, if a skater was ranked first by a majority of the judges, that skater was placed first overall, and the process was repeated for each place.  If no absolute majority for a place existed, the tiebreakers were, in order: 1) Total Ordinals, 2) Total Points, 3) Compulsory Figure Points.",na,"The defending champion from 1920, 30-year-old Swede Gillis Grafström, was the only competitor from Antwerp also competing in Chamonix. The elegant Swede, famous for his smooth and orthodox routines, had won the World Championships in 1922. The European Championships of 1924 were organized in Davos, nine days before the Olympics, with Grafström absent. The champion from Davos, Austrian Fritz Kachler, was not entered for Chamonix. Of the nine skaters competing in Davos, only the Englishman Jack Page, fifth in Davos, and the Suiss Georges Gautschi, seventh, took the trip to Chamonix.
Grafström’s toughest opponent among a total of 11 participants at the Olympics was another Austrian, Willi Böckl, an engineer from Klagenfurt born in 1893 like Grafström. Böckl represented another style than the Swede, skating more powerful and aggressively. He was the first figure skater to land a double Rittberger.
Grafström was in the lead after the compulsory figures, but in the free skating Böckl had the better ordinals, but not enough to catch Grafström. Gautschi was a surprise, winning the bronze medal. The judging could certainly be described as chauvinistic. Grafström was first of four out of seven judges, none of them Swedish. The two Austrian judges had Böckl first both in the figures and free skating, and the seventh judge, a Czech, had his countryman Josef Slíva, ending fourth, as the winner.

After all, she had won the Olympic title in 2008 and 2012, had two World Time Trial titles to her name and won her fourth US National Time Trial title after coming out of retirement in 2015 – eight years after her last success. She may have been 43-years-of-age the day after the Rio race, but with age came experience. Having retired after Beijing, and for a second time after London, it was another comeback for the American as she sought Olympic title number three. Linda Villumsen of New Zealand and Lisa Brennauer of Germany were the 2015 and 2014 World Time Trial Champions respectively and offered a serious challenge to Armstrong. Villumsen had six World titles to her name.
There were no changes in the format since London 2012, with the 25 starters setting off at 90-second intervals over the 29.7 km circuit which started from Tim Maia Square in Pontal, west Rio de Janeiro. After a 2.5 km ride on the flat, the riders entered the 24.7 km Grumari circuit, which they completed one lap of before the ride back to the starting point.
As expected, Armstrong set the early pace on a rainy day in Pontal, leading through the first split, just less than five seconds ahead of the Italian Elisa Longo Borghini, the daughter of the Olympic cross country skier Guidina Dal Sasso, with the Netherlands rider Anna van der Breggen, the 2015 World Championship runner-up, in third place. Van der Breggen and Longo Borghini had finished first and third respectively in the Rio road race just three days earlier.
Up from sixth to first place at split two was Russia’s London 2012 bronze medallist Olga Zabelinskaya, the daughter of the 1980 Olympic road race champion Sergey Sukhoruchenkov. Armstrong was 2.88 seconds behind in second place with the Italian Longo Borghini a further 4.1 seconds adrift in third.
It was a case of too little too late for the 2014 World Champion Lisa Brennauer who, despite the fastest time in the final phase could only finish a lowly eighth, while Armstrong clawed back Zabelinskaya to overtake her at the top of the leaderboard and beat the Russian by 5.55 seconds to take her third consecutive Olympic gold medal whilst van der Breggen ousted Longo Borghini to take the bronze medal. As she crossed the line, Armstrong was so exhausted after her final sprint, she collapsed. But she had vindicated her selection onto the US team which many had criticised at the time as she became the first female cyclist, track or road, to win the same event at three consecutive Olympics.
For Zabelinskaya, she raised her arms thinking she had secured gold as she crossed the line only to watch disappointingly as Armstrong deprived her of gold. Had the Russian won, that too would have been controversial as she had returned to the sport shortly before the Games following a drugs ban.

His grandfather, also called Aldo, had competed at the 1936 and 1948 Games whilst his father and two uncles had been stalwarts of the Italian teams during the 70s.
Whilst the family had produced individual medallists and team gold medal winners the one thing missing from the family’s CV was an Olympic gold medal in an individual event.
Montano entered the Olympics as a bronze medallist from the 2013 World Championships but the favourites for the title were reigning world champion and #1 seed Volodymyr Lukashenko of Ukraine and Russian Stanislav Pozdnyakov, who had won the 2011 and 2012 World titles.
All proceeded smoothly until the quarter finals where Lukashenko, Pozdnyakov and reigning champion Mihai Covaliu fell in quick succession.
After an easy semi-final victory against Dmitry Lapkes of Belarus, Montano met with tougher opposition in the form of Hungary’s Zsolt Nemcsik in the final. Montano had to fight back from an early 5-1 deficit and a warning for arguing with the officials, to take victory in a bout which went to the last possible point.  The Italian team marked his victory by hurling him into the air in celebration.

The bronze medallist on the beam at the 2013 World championships, she won gold in 2014 and 2015 and was the highest placed qualifier in Rio. Just behind her, qualifying in second place, was her fellow American Laurie Hernandez, who only joined the senior US team in 2016. Had the two-gymnasts-per-country rule not applied, the US would have had four of the eight finalists because Aly Raisman and Gabby Douglas both finished in the top eight qualifiers. Local Brazilian favourite Flávia Saraiva was on form going into the final and was third in qualifying.
Biles was third to go and started off magnificently as always but then, going for a forward somersault, she wobbled on landing on the beam and had to use both hands to hold on and stop herself slipping onto the floor. She was awarded 14.733 points, nearly a point less than her qualification mark, and her total was there to be beaten by the remaining five girls. The first to have a go at overhauling Biles was Sanne Wevers of Netherlands, the runner-up to Biles in the 2015 Worlds and winner of the Olympic Test Event in Rio, and she gave a near perfect performance including a triple, to score 15.466 and go well ahead at the top of the leader board, thus ending Biles’ dream of five golds.
Cătălina Ponor of Romania did nothing to change the medal positions with her 14.000, but Laurie Hernandez moved into the silver medal position above Biles with 15.333. Biles was now in danger of losing her bronze medal with Marine Boyer of France and Brazil’s Saraiva still to go, but the best either could muster was a 14.600 from Boyer, as Biles held on for bronze. Wevers became the first Dutch female gymnast to win an individual gold medal, only their second individual gold medal winner, after Epke Zonderland on the men’s horizontal bar at London 2012, and only their third gold medallist ever after their women won the all-round team competition in 1928. Whilst Wevers took gold, it turned out the only person capable of beating Simone Biles was herself as she proved she was not super-human after all.

Algerian Taoufik Makhloufi won the first semi in the slow time of 3:42.24, while Moroccan Abdalaati Iguider took the over semi in a quick 3:33.99. Makhloufi had little international rep prior to 2012 but had improved dramatically in the Olympic year, boosting his PR from 3:34.4 to 3:30.80 coming into London.
The day after the 1,500 semi, Makhloufi ran in the 800 metre heats and jogged about 150 metres before dropping out, presumably to save himself for the 1,500. But he fell afoul of the best effort rules and was disqualified, and that would cause him to be disqualified from the 1,500 as well. The Algerian officials quickly found an out, as they produced a doctor’s note about him being hampered by a “knee injury”. The IAAF accepted this note, and Makhloufi was allowed to run in the 1,500 final.
And in the 1,500 final, Makhloufi made a remarkable recover from his “knee injury”, winning the gold medal in 3:34.08 over American Leo Manzano, who took the silver. Kiprop was a non-factor, suffering from a hamstring strain, and the Kenyans flopped, with Kiplagat placing seventh, Chepseba 11th, and Kiprop 12th and last in the final. Kiplagat and Chepseba actually led with 300 metres left, but Makhloufi blew by them on back straight of the final lap, covering the 200 from 1200-1400 metres in 25.4. That won him the gold medal, as he held on in the final straight, never really being challenged. Behind him, Manzano flew by the others, covering his last 100 in 13.1. Asked about his recovery from his knee problem, Makhloufi noted, “It was the will of God.”
That was how the event and the results seemed to have ended. In 2015, however, the IOC began re-testing samples from the 2008 Beijing and 2012 London Olympics, using newer, more advanced testing techniques, in an effort to find those who had used performance enhancing drugs (PEDs), but in whom it could not be detected at the time of those Olympics. This was one of the many events affected.
The leading results were not changed but between July 2014 and October 2015 two runners who competed in the heats were disqualified for biological passport offenses. These were Saudi Arabian Mohammed Shaween and Qatarian Hamza Driouch.

Vincent-Lapointe refuted all the charges, which lead to her suspension from competition. In January 2020, the ICF accepted Lapointe’s evidence, supporting that she was the victim of a third-party contamination and she was cleared retroactively of all the charges and allowed to return to training and competition.
Vincent-Lapointe and Harrison both easily won their preliminaries in Tokyo and directly qualified into the semi-final, where they took part in the same heat.

It was already proposed to be included at the 2010 Vancouver Winter Olympics, but was not approved by the IOC until 2015, for the PyeongChang Games. The discipline is played with only two players in each team, one male and one female, throwing five stones altogether. One major difference to traditional team curling are the two stones – one for each team - that are positioned prior to the beginning of the end. One stone is positioned in the back of the four foot circle and one as center guard. The team with the hammer, i.e. with the right of the last stone, can opt for either stone. Recently, a power play option was introduced that allows additional options for positioning of the stones but, in official tournaments, just once per game.
Previous World Mixed Championships also saw countries on the podium that never excelled in traditional team curling, like Hungary, Austria or Spain. The final of the last World Championship in 2017 was won by Switzerland, the most successful nation in mixed doubles curling, with six titles in ten World Championships. PyeongChang produced a repeat of the 2017 World final with Switzerland again playing Canada. This time, however, the North Americans came out on top, to make up for their disappointing performances in the men’s and women’ events.
Eight teams, mostly from traditional curling nations, qualified for the mixed event, four European, two North American and one Asian, plus South Korea as the host nation. Canada placed first in the round robin stage with Switzerland second. The team “Olympic Athletes from Russia”, Norway and China tied with four wins each. China was defeated by Norway in the tie breaker, although they had dominated Norway 9-3 in the round robin game. In the semi-finals, Canada and Switzerland prevailed, thus confirming the final standing of the round robin. In the final, the Swiss team of Jenny Perret and Martin Rios was no match for the Canadians Kaitlyn Lawes and John Morris. They won three of the ends with two stones, and won the third end by four as Canada built a comfortable lead and Switzerland resigned after six ends trailing 3-10. Switzerland’s Rios and Perret had been World Champions in 2017, Rios for the second time, having also won in 2012. For the two players in the recently formed Canadian duo, it was already their second major gold: Lawes won the gold with the women’s team at Sochi, and Morris won gold with the men’s team in Vancouver.
Together with her partner and, since 2017, husband Aleksandr Krushelnitsky, Anastasiya Bryzgalova was the mixed doubles World Champion in 2016. In PyeongChang they beat Norway’s Kristin Skaslien and Magnus Nedregotten for third place by 8-4, in a game where the Norwegians always trailed the Russians. Just days later, Krushelnitsky was tested positive for the banned drug Meldonium, a cardiovascular active substance produced in Latvia and only approved in some Eastern European countries, including Russia. He was found guilty by the Court of Abitration for Sport (CAS) on February 22nd and both athletes returned their bronze medals. The medals were awarded to the Norwegians, also a couple in real life, who had represented Norway at five World Championships, winning a bronze in 2015. They had already returned to their home country after their bronze-medal match, but returned to Korea immediately to be awarded their medals on February 24th, a unique procedure in Olympic history. After appeals, the disqualification of Krushelnitsky and the OAR team was upheld by the CAS in a final decision announced 4 December 2018. Krushelnitsky planned an appeal but in January 2019 dropped those plans, and the result seemed finalized.

The original plans allowed each nation to enter as many as four teams, but at the annual meeting of the Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) in 1911, the following ruling was made, “Although the rules for the Football Competitions at the Olympic Games of Stockholm in 1912 permit every nation affiliated to Fédération Internationale de Football Association to send four teams to the competition, the Fédération considers it most suitable that each nation should send only one.”  The original ruling was made to allow Great Britain to enter four teams - one each for England, Ireland, Scotland, and Wales.  However, The Scottish Football Association (founded in 1873), The Football Association of Wales (founded in 1876), and the Irish Football Association (founded in 1880), all decided not to enter.  It was left to The Football Association, founded in 1863, and governing football in England, to enter a team.
The entries closed on 29 May and 13 teams were entered.  France and Belgium originally entered but withdrew, leaving 11 teams to compete for the championship.  Bohemia also tried to enter a team but its entry was refused as it was no longer a member of FIFA.
The event was planned as a single-elimination competition and the draw was held on 18 June 1912 at the office of (Svenska Gymnastik - och Idrottsföreningarnas Riksförbund (the National Football of Swedish Gymnastics and Sports Club).  The two losing semi-finalists competed for the bronze medals.  A consolation tournament was also conducted with all losing teams from the first two rounds allowed to compete.  First prize in the consolation tournament was silver medals from the Svenska Fotbollförbundet (Swedish Football Association), while second prize was bronze medals from the same organization.
The games were at three arenas in or near Stockholm: The Olympic Stadium, Råsunda Idrottsplats, and Tranebergs Idrottsplats. Råsunda Idrottsplats was inaugurated in 1910 and was jointly owned by Svenska Fotbollförbundet and some football clubs in Stockholm.  It had a stand for 2,000 spectators and a total capacity of around 12,000.  In 1937 it was rebuilt with concrete stands for 40,000 spectators, becoming the national arena for Swedish football (the Wembley of Sweden), and renamed Fotbollstadion.  It was further enlarged to 50,000 seats for the 1958 World Cup finals when it was the main stadium.  Tranebergs Idrottsplats was the home ground of Djurgårdens IF, one of the leading football clubs in Stockholm.  It was inaugurated in 1911, with a stand for 2,000 spectators and a total capacity of around 10,000.
The weather during the 1912 Olympic football tournament was exceptionally warm for Sweden, so much so that buckets of water were placed besides the touch-lines so players could refresh themselves during play.
England won the gold medal fairly easily, winning their first two matches by 7-0 against Hungary and 4-0 against Finland.  In the semi-final match against Finland, Harold Walden scored two goals for England, and in the first round against Hungary, he had scored six of Britain seven goals.  In addition to the medals awarded to the British players, Great Britain earned possession of the Challenge Trophy for football, which had been donatde in 1908 by The Football Association of Great Britain.
In the final, Denmark was hampered by the loss of Poul )Tist) Nielsen, who had sprained his knee against The Netherlands in the semi-finals.  The first goal of the final was scored by England’s Walden at 10 minutes.  At 22 minutes, Gordon Hoare made the score England 2, Denmark 0.  Shortly thereafter, Denmark’s Anton Olsen scored from 25 metres out to tighten up the match.  Unfortunately, shortly before the interval Charles Buchwald of Denmark, after a heading duel with Vivian Woodward, dislocated his shoulder and was unable to continue.  England took advantage of this by scoring two goals within three minutes to lead 4-1 at the half.  Although playing a man down in the second half, Denmark managed to reduce the lead to 4-2, which was the final score.
In the first round of the consolation series, Germany defeated Russia 16-0, led by Gottfried Fuchs, who scored 10 goals, equalling the Olympic record which had been set by Denmark’s Sofus Nielsen in 1908.  Harold Walden’s 11 goals still made him the highest overall goal scorer for the Olympic tournament.

It was noted, however, that they deserved this somewhat because they rode near the end of the pack for much of the race, and thus were susceptible to a crash.  The crash occurred on the penultimate lap when McCrea swerved into the rider alongside him and they struck two other riders.  Hurley, Downing, Billington and Goerke were behind them and fell over the fallen riders.

France’s Samir Aït Saïd was hoping to get a medal after making a comeback from the horrific leg injury he suffered at Rio 2016.
Zanetti was the first to go, but his 14.133 was never going to be enough to give him another silver and he eventually finished last of the eight gymnasts. The Chinese pair of Liu Yang and You Hao were next up and Hao took the lead with 15.300 before Liu topped that with 15.400. World champion Colak could only finish fifth with 14.866, while the reigning champion Petrounias, who was the penultimate gymnast to take to the rings, picked up a bronze with the only other score over 15 points (15.200). France’s Aït Saïd finished fourth, 0.300 points behind Petrounias.
Liu Yang gave a relaxed performance rounded off with a tucked, double-double dismount as it helped secure the first 1-2 in gymnastics competition at the Olympics for Chinese gymnasts since Chen Yibing and Yang Wei, also on the rings, at Beijing 2008. Liu Yang’s gold was China’s first of the Tokyo Games.

She had won the 800 freestyle at the London Olympics and there was no heavier favorite in Rio swimming than Ledecky in the women’s 400 and 800 freestyle.
In the heats, Ledecky swam 3:58.71, the fastest qualifying time by almost five seconds. She bettered that in the final by breaking her own world record with a time of 3:56.46, to win the first of her expected three individual gold medals. It was her third world record in the event.
Behind Ledecky, her teammate Leah Smith was expected to medal and she came through for the bronze. Smith also trailed surprising British swimmer Jazz Carlin, who was not on anybody’s favorite list for the event, although she had won gold in this event at the 2014 European Championships.
Before the end of the Rio Olympics, Ledecky won all the distance freestyle events (200-400-800), adding a gold medal in the 4x200 relay and a silver medal in the 4x100 free relay. Carlin would add another silver, also finishing second in the 800 freestyle.

American Jenn Stuczynski was the second choice but Isinbayeva would likely have to no height for her to win. Stuczynski did not think so, stating after the Olympics Trials, “I hope we do some damage and, you know, kick some Russian butt.” Isi heard the comment and it only served to rev her up. Isinbayeva opened with a first-vault clearance at 4.70 (15-5). Stuczynski led after clearing 4.80 (15-9), and was the only other vaulter left, as Is passed to 4.85 (15-11). The two then played a game of cat-and-mouse passing, as Stuczynski passed that height. She jumped at 4.90 (16-0¾), at which the Russian passed, but went out after three misses.

The downhill phase was held on the same course as the downhill event five days before but the course was shortened, starting at an altitude of 1,947 metres. The race started between “Accola Valley” and “Babya Yama”, the first race going off at 1000.
Only two Super Combined events were scheduled during the 2013/14 World Cup and both were held prior to the Games. In Wengen Ted Ligety won in front of Alexis Pinturault while nine days later in Kitzbühel Pinturault beat Ligety, which meant that these two also topped the Combined scoring for the winter. In former years Ivica Kostelić was the dominant racer placing first in the Combined World Cup 2010/11 as well as in 2011/12 and tied with Pinturault in 2012/13. Aksel Lund Svindal was World Champion in 2011, while Ligety won in 2013, with Kostelić winning the World Cup Super Combined held as pre-Olympic event in Sochi in February 2012.
Aleksander Kilde, skiing first, set the early downhill target time of 1:53.85. Three starters later the time was bettered by Ondřej Bank (CZE) and, soon afterwards, by Kjetil Jansrud (NOR), who was to set the fastest time of the downhill phase in 1:53.24. Defending champion Bode Miller had a relatively poor race by his standards, placing 12th.
Adam Žamba (SVK), 27th after the downhill but a slalom specialist, skied what would be the best slalom time of 50.11 to put him in the lead and, eventually take fifth place. People were left wondering whether Žamba could do the impossible and win, until Sandro Viletta (SUI) produced what would be the second fastest slalom and a combined time of 2:45.20 to lead Žamba by 1.14 seconds. Miller skied a slightly better slalom, but still finished 0.26 seconds behind Žamba and was to eventually finish sixth. Viletta’s first close challenger was to come from an unexpected source, Christof Innerhofer (ITA), a downhill specialist who was silver medallist in his specialist event. Innerhofer was to produce the joint third fastest slalom and finished 0.47 seconds behind Viletta, which appeared to leave the door open for Kostelić, but he was a little cautious on the slalom run and finished 0.34 seconds behind Viletta. For Kostelić this was his 4th Olympic silver medal, the gold having eluded him so far. The downhill leaders, Bank and Jansrud, were unable to keep their positions and finished seventh and fourth respectively.
Viletta was an unexpected winner as he had only one podium finish in the World Cup with a Super G win in Beaver Creek in December 2011 and his best World Cup Combined result was a fourth place. He became the first Olympic champion (men and women) in Alpine skiing Combined for Switzerland ever and as he used Salomon skis he won the sole gold medal for this manufacturer at Sochi. Kostelić, on Fischer skis, won their lone medal in men’s Alpine events, while Innerhofer won another medal for Rossignol.

Brazil qualified automatically as hosts, and were joined by the top two teams in the 2015 FIVB World Cup in Japan, USA and Italy. Also qualified were the winners of five Continental Olympic Qualification Tournaments in Africa (Egypt), Asia (Iran), Europe (Russia), NORCECA - North, Central America & Caribbean - (Cuba) and South America (Argentina). The compliment of 12 teams was made up with four teams (Poland, France, Canada and Mexico) coming through two Olympic Qualification Tournaments held in Japan and Mexico.
The men’s tournament was one of the best seen at the Olympic Games for many years with any one of the eight quarter-finalists capable of winning the gold medal. The top six seeds all made it through to the last eight, and they included the reigning World Champions Cup winners Brazil, the 2014 World Champions Poland, and the 2015 World Cup winners, USA.  However, another of the fancied teams, France, the 2015 European Champions and World League winners failed to qualify out of their pool following defeats by the strong trio of Italy, USA and Brazil. Canada were the surprise team in Pool A, finishing second with Brazil just qualifying in fourth place. The United States finished third but looked like heading for an early exit after losing their first two matches to Canada and Italy.
Argentina, Poland and Russia all qualified from pool B after four wins each, and they were joined by Iran who had an impressive début tournament, making it to the quarters where they lost 3-0 to Italy. The US progressed to the semi-finals after also winning 3-0 in the last eight against Poland, and Russia’s 3-0 win over Canada also assured them a place in the last four, which was completed when Brazil won the all-South American clash with Argentina 3-1.
Having already engaged in a two-hour match in pool A, Italy and the United States met again in the semi-final. Italy won the pool game 3-1 but now the two teams fought out a five-setter lasting 2hr 28m, the longest match of the entire tournament. The first two sets went to 30-28, 26-28 before the US won the third 25-9 and Italy leveled it in the fourth and in the tie-break set the Europeans won it 15-9. The other semi-final was a more one-sided affair with hosts Brazil beating the 2012 champions Russia 25-21, 25-20, 25-17, and at the same time avenging defeat by the Russians in the London final. Playing for Russia was Sergey Tetyukhin, a member of the 2012 gold-medal winning team who was playing in his sixth Olympics, going back to 1996. The United States had taken the young team that won the 2015 World Cup to Rio and eight of their squad had no previous Olympic experience but that did not show as they staged a remarkable comeback in the bronze medal match when they came from two sets down to beat Russia 15-13 in the tie-break set with an ace from Matt Anderson, the World Cup MVP and one of the stars of Rio.
The home fans eagerly anticipated the final between Brazil and Italy and they were hoping their team would end the drought of a men’s Olympic gold medal going back to 2004. Brazil and Italy met in pool A and despite winning the first set on that occasion, Brazil lost 3-1. Now in a country where volleyball is second only in popularity to football, the fervent fans were hoping for a reversal of fortune and with the legendary coach Bernardhino in charge of the team, they must have fancied their chances, particularly as he had guided his country to three World titles, two Olympic titles and nine World League titles. Despite the 3-0 scoreline in Brazil’s favour at the Maracanãzinho, they had to fight hard for their 25-22, 28-26, 26-24 win, and they had to stave off a set point held by the Italians in the second set. Escadinha, the tournament’s MVP won his fourth Olympic medal and was the only survivor from Brazil’s last gold-medal winning team in 2004.

After making the shooting events gender equal, Tokyo saw the smallest field ever in this event at the Olympics with only 30 competitors but, with Gabriele Rossetti (2017), Jesper Hansen (2013), Giorgos Akhilleos (2007) and Abdullah Al-Rashidi (1995, 1997 and 1998), four more former individual World Champions competed. Rossetti (gold) and Al-Rashidi (bronze) had also won medals in Rio.
Eric Delaunay and Tammaro Cassandro both bettered the Olympic record in the qualification round with 124 hits, missing only one target each. Delaunay won the shoot-off to be placed first, which would be important for the final. Eetu Kallioinen finished third and six shooters tied for fourth, so a shoot-off for the remaining three places in the final was necessary. Hancock, Al-Rashidi and Hansen secured the three final spots and these three went on to win the medals. Cassandro was eliminated first in the final as he was placed lowest tied with Delaunay, but as Delaunay won the shoot-off for first place in the qualification he was placed ahead, only to be eliminated after the next series. After round four Kallioinen was eliminated, one point behind Al-Rashidi after both had missed two of the last three targets.
Participating in his seventh Olympics Al-Rashidi won bronze for the second time after Rio 2016, while Hancock won his third gold medal, missing only one target in the final, which meant it was silver for Hansen. Hancock became only the third shooter to three-peat in an individual event, after Ralf Schumann (GER) in rapid-fire pistol in 1992-2004 (not consecutive) and Jin Jong-O (KOR) in free pistol in 2008-16. Al-Rashidi, born 21 August 1963 and aged 57 years 339 days, became the oldest shooting medallist at the Tokyo Games, an honor he had previously achieved in 2016. Of all sports in Tokyo he was the second oldest medallist, behind equestrian rider Andrew Hoy.

His biggest competition was expected to come from his teammate, Karl Schranz, runner-up in the event at the 1962 Worlds, and World Champion in the downhill and combined.

Bonlieu had also won a bronze in the event at the 1958 Worlds, and his run in Innsbruck enabled him to take the lead, with 1:46.71. Karl Schranz was the last skier off among the seeded racers, starting 15th. He skied well, besting Stiegler for silver, but not overcome Bonlieu’s time, which won the gold medal.

He had switched to heavyweight in 2010 and again won a gold medal in the Asian Games, as well as at that year’s Asian Championships. Yazdani was a favorite, but he was expected to be challenged by Abdusalam Gadisov who, as the 2012 European Champion, represented the strong Russian presence in this event, as Russian wrestlers had won the past two Olympics. These two were the favorites and, when they were drawn into the same bracket, the question of who would challenge for gold remained an elusive one.
Yazdani and Gadisov met in the 1/8th finals, where Yazdani emerged victorious and moved on to the semi-finals, where he experienced intense pain from an old knee injury in the first period fight against Valeriy Andriitsev of Ukraine and had to be taken out of the arena in a wheelchair. Andriitsev was the runner-up at the most recent European Championships and met Jake Varner of the United States in the gold medal match, who was a bronze medalist from the 2011 World Championships. The two were ferocious, but evenly-matched, in the final but Varner was able to score just one point in each period to earn the Olympic crown.
The first bronze medal bout was contested between Kurban Kurbanov of Uzbekistan, 2011 Asian Champion, runner-up at the 2010 Asian Games, and bronze medalist at the 2007 World Championships, and Giorgi Gogshelidze of Georgia, a former competitor for Russia who was a 2008 Olympic bronze medalist, 2001 World Champion, and 2008 European Champion among a host of other accolades. Kurbanov managed to push Gogshelidze out of the ring in the first period to win it, but the Georgian got his revenge by scoring four unanswered points in the first minute of the second round. In the final period, Gogshelidze continued to be dominant and evoked little response from the Uzbek, winning the bronze medal with a score of 2-0. The battle for the final podium spot would ostensibly have been between Yazdani and the winner of repêchage round two but, with the Iranian injured, the true deciding match was the repêchage, fought between Rustam Iskandari of Tajikistan, a rookie, and Xetaq Qazyumov of Azerbaijan, 2008 Olympic bronze medalist, 2010 World Champion, 2009 world runner-up, and thrice European Champion (2009-2011). Qazyumov was the overwhelming favorite and did not disappoint; although Iskandari scored the first point, he was not able to repeat it, losing 1-3 and 0-3 to give the Azerbaijani his second Olympic bronze.

Three weeks before the Olympic Games began Federer won his 7th Wimbledon title by beating Britain’s  Andy Murray in the final but in London the roles were dramatically reversed.Seemingly inspired by the Olympic atmosphere Murray first defeated Đoković in the semi-finals then won the Olympic title with a shockingly easy victory over Federer with the loss of only 7 games. This was the biggest victory for a British male tennis player for three quarters of a century and proved a career turning point for Murray as the perennial “nearly man” of men’s tennis then went on to win the US Open later in the year.
The growing acceptance of the importance of the Olympic Games in the world of tennis (and vice versa) was best demonstrated by what happened the end of the bronze medal match between Đoković and Argentina’s Juan Martín del Potro. Overcome with emotion after clinching his nation’s first medal of London 2012 del Potro went down on his knees and started crying.

Her biggest challengers were expected to be the defending champion, Soviet Nataliya Petrusyova, who held the world record of 1:19.31, set at Medeo in 1983, and was the 1982 World Sprint champion, and Enke’s East German teammate, Andrea Schöne, who had won the 1983 World Championships and was second to Enke in both 1982 and 1984.
The 500 champion, Christa Rothenburger, started in the first pair and posted an Olympic record 1:23.98. Schöne was in the second pair, and although she started slowly, she was well ahead of Rothenburger at 600 metres, and finished in 1:22.83 to take the lead. Enke was in the next pairing. She had the fastest start of the event and held on to it, crossing the line in 1:21.61, which would win her the gold medal. Petrusyova was in the sixth group but her time of 1:23.21 would be good only for bronze. One other medal favorite was Nataliya Glebova, who started very well, but fell at 150 metres.
A few weeks later, at the 1984 World Sprint Championships, Enke would again win the title, this time dominating by winning all four races. In her career she would win eventually win eight Olympic medals (3 gold, 4 silver, 1 bronze), and 11 World Championships (6 sprint, 5 all-around).

Even in the heats at Atlanta things looked bleak for the Australian as he only qualified for the final with 0.2 of a second to spare over the fifteen minute race. Perkins blamed his heat performance on an attempt to qualify with the least effort which had the negative effect of spoiling his body posture and slowing him down more than desired. He only made the final as the last qualifier.
Perkins put things to right in the final and, after taking the lead almost from the gun, sped ahead and was never troubled again. His time was 15 seconds off his own world record but still good enough to take a clear victory over his rivals.

Those looking to dethrone Hanyu, included Shoma Uno of Japan, China’s Jin Boyang, Spain’s Javier Fernández and USA’s Nathan Chen. Also in the field was Canada’s Patrick Chan, the two-time Olympic silver medalist (2014) and three-time World champion (2011, 2012, 2013), who already had won the 2018 Olympic team event, and was in search of another medal in PyeongChang.
In another era, Uno would have been the world number one figure skater and have the adoration of his nation, except for one thing – his countryman Hanyu. Uno, the 2015 World Junior champion, was narrowly defeated for gold by Hanyu at the 2017 World Championships (by 2.28 points), settling for silver.
China’s Jin Boyang, two-time World bronze medalist (Boston 2016, Milan 2017) and 2015 World Junior silver medalist, was the first skater to ever land four quad jumps in a free skate, six quads in international competition, first ever to land a quad lutz-triple toe loop combination in international competition, and the former record holder of scoring the most points on one element (the quad lutz-triple toe loop combination).
Fernández, a two-time Olympian (2010, 2014), arrived in PyeongChang as the two-time World champion (2015, 2016) and six-time consecutive European champion (2013-2018).
The American Chen had the most pressure on him, and had been anointed the Olympic champion even before the Games started.  He was, at the time, the only skater ever to land five quadruple jumps in one routine, which he did at the USA Championships in January 2018, just prior to the Olympic Winter Games.
The other American, media darling Adam Rippon, had a different pressure on him when he was thrown into the global spotlight carrying an entire community on his back as, the first openly gay man to be named to the USA Olympic Winter team. While not fighting for the top of the podium, a bronze medal was possible.
Skating to Chopin’s “Ballade No. 1” and landing two quads, Hanyu led after the short program, with the second highest short program score ever recorded (the only higher score was also from Hanyu). His performance brought a sea of Winnie-the-Pooh stuffed animals raining down on the ice from his fans, as a result of Hanyu’s affection for the A. A. Milne character.  But the real test would be to see if the recently recovered ankle injury could hold up to all the jumping in the free skate. He was followed in the scores by Fernández, Uno and Jin. Chan sat in sixth. The American Chen had a disastrous short program, leaving him in 17th position and no hope of a medal.
A picture of poise and elegance, Hanyu skated masterfully in the long program free skate, unaffected by his ankle injury, scoring 206.17 points giving him a total of 317.85 points and the gold medal - the 1000th medal event in the history of the Olympic Winter Games. His fans went bonkers – screaming, crying, waving flags and caricatures, and of course, more Winnine-the-Poohs for their champion. Hanyu had become the first man in 66 years to win consecutive gold medals in figure skating (after USA’s Dick Button in 1948 and 1952). Fellow countryman Uno won the silver medal, and Spain’s Fernández captured the bronze medal (winning his country’s first figure skating medal and fourth medal ever at the Winter Olympics). Jin overtook Chen by less than a point, placing fourth overall and representing a new optimism for his nation in men’s singles.  More history was made when Vincent Zhou landed the first Olympic quadruple lutz, one of the sport’s most difficult jumps.
With nothing to lose in the long program free skate, Chen went for broke by throwing in six quadruple jumps, orchestrating one of the greatest comebacks in figure skating history to win the free skate with a score of 215.08 points (8.91 points ahead of Hanyu, followed by Uno and Fernández) and lead in points, until the final five skaters. He placed an incredible fifth overall.

The nation sent their Olympic champions in the coxless pairs, Siegfried Brietzke and Wolfgang Mager, to Montreal for the event, and they were joined by Andreas Decker and Stefan Semmler. Together, this quartet was on their second of three consecutive victories in the event at the World Championships. Meanwhile, three members of the Soviet crew, Raul Arnemann, Nikolay Kuznetsov, and Anushavan Gassan-Dzhalilov, had won silver at the past two World Championships, and they were joined by Valery Dolinin.
In the opening round, East Germany set an Olympic record, defeated the Soviet Union in its heat, and was over 12 seconds ahead of the other heat winners from West Germany and the United States.  They set another Olympic record in the semi-finals, but a surprise came in the other heat when the Norwegians, who had survived only through the repêchage, beat out the Soviet Union to win their heat. Three of their crew, Ole Nafstad, Arne Bergodd, and Rolf Andreassen, had been bronze medalists at the final edition of the European Championships, while Nafstad  also had silver from the 1971 edition. Although the East Germans dominated the final and took gold easily, the underdog Norwegians earned the adoration of many spectators by defeating the Soviet Union once again and capturing silver, leaving the USSR with bronze.

924553,"Downhill, Women",2010 Winter Olympics,57,Alpine Skiing,/editions/57/sports/ALP,17 February 2010 — 11:00,"Whistler Creekside, Whistler (Franz's Downhill)",44 from 22 countries,na,IFR,"Franz’s Run was described as one of the most difficult women’s downhill pistes, a very fast and selective course with some interesting sections like “Deuce”, “Jokers Travers”, and “Frog Bank”. The first training run on Thursday, 11 February was stopped after only two starters when Stacey Cook crashed and was brought to hospital by helicopter, but luckily she was unhurt. The other scheduled training runs were cancelled, but a downhill race needs at least one practice run, so a training session was held on Monday, 15 February, before and after the men’s race. The men’s Dave Murray Downhill and Franz’s Run share the “Hot Air” section and the finish, so there was the curious situation that the training run was divided into two parts. The first part was finished right before the two pistes became one, and when the men’s race was ended the women started again this time from the slalom start and skied the last 20 seconds of their course. This meant that the racers did not hit racing speed at “Hot Air”, which became an important and dangerous fact during the race.
There were only two favorites considered – the close friends Lindsey Vonn and Maria Riesch. Vonn was fastest in the only training run, won the 2009 World Championship title as well as the Downhill World Cup in 2007-08 and 2008-09, and won five of the first six World Cup downhills during the 2009-10 season. Riesch won the last World Cup downhill race before the Olympics in St. Moritz and was also second in the Downhill World Cup. Vonn injured her shin while training only a week before the Olympics, but the postponement of the super combined event gave her time to recover. The gold medalist from Turin 2006 Michaela Dorfmeister retried shortly after those Games. The silver medalist Martina Schild was unable to compete due to injury. She suffered an anterior cruciate ligament tear after a fall while training for the last World Cup downhill before the Games. The only World Cup downhill race held on Franz’s Run on 22 February 2008 had been won by Nadia Styger.
The race started at 11 AM with perfect sunny weather and a frozen piste with hard, but bumpy snow. With the first starters it was shown that the course was very difficult and that it would be nearly impossible to run with no problems. The first notable time was set by Austrian Elisabeth Görgl with bib number 5 when she topped the time of Stacey Cook by more than 1.3 seconds. Julia Mancuso in the 10th starting position bettered all of Görgl’s splits and took the lead by 0.9 seconds. With bib number 11 Dominique Gisin crashed at the last jump, the “Hot Air”, and the race was held up for some time. Gisin sustained a concussion and after her fall a snow hill next to the finish line was dug out to increase safety. The first downhiller of the top group was Lindsey Vonn. She took the lead from the first intermediate split to the finish to take the lead. In start position #21, Sweden’s Anja Pärson did a great race when she placed in the top three at all intermediates, but near the finish Pärson was unable to manage a 60 metre jump, and crashed horrifically. She hit hard on her back and slid into the finish area, and the race was held up for a longer time. Pärson was able to walk away, but with contusions of her leg and back. Maria Riesch had to wait until Pärson was rescued and the piste was opened again. After watching multiple crashes, Riesch did not perform at her best and never contended for a medal, finishing eighth.
At the end the top favorite Vonn won gold with an average speed of 101.55 km/hr and was 0.56 seconds or 15.71 metres in front of Mancuso. Surprisingly Görgl, shocked after the crash of Pärson, won bronze exactly 50 years after her mother Traudl Hecher also won bronze in the Olympic downhill at Squaw Valley. The first five finishers skied on four different products: Vonn and Görgl used Head; Mancuso preferred Rossignol; while Andrea Fischbacher was on Atomic and Fabienne Suter on Stöckli.

But in the Olympic season, she got competition from a young German skater, Stephanie Beckert. While Beckert had not beaten Sáblíková in the 5,000 m, she had done so twice in the 3,000 m, and Beckert was considered to be stronger in the longer event. A third title contender was the defending champion, Clara Hughes, who, at 37-years-old, was hoping to end her career with a gold medal in Vancouver, and her silver medals in the 2008 and 2009 World Championships showed this was not impossible.
Hughes skated as the first of the favorites. She recorded a very solid performance, with slowly increasing lap times, finishing in 6:55.73, a time that virtually ensured her of a medal. In pair seven, Beckert faced Kristina Groves, who also enjoyed medal hopes on virtue of three bronze medals at the past three World Championships in the 5,000 m. But Beckert soon left the Canadian behind her, and powered on to a new personal best: 6:51.39. This gave Sáblíková a tough assignment, but she was up to the task.

The vast majority of the spectators knew little of lacrosse and even those familiar with the game were often confused, as some rules had been modified to bring together certain differences in the Canadian and English laws.  The goal crease was enlarged and special restrictions prevented an opponent from entering it.  The ball was intermediate in weight between the lighter English ball and the heavier Canadian ball.  Play was also divided into four quarters instead of two halves.
At the end of the first quarter Canada led 5-1 and then 6-2 at half-time after which some brilliant play by England tied the game at 9-9, before Canada rallied to win the game, 14-10. The scoring was started by Henry Hoobin who put Canada ahead, 1-0, before Britain’s George Buckland equaled the match at 1-1. Canada led at the end of the first quarter, 5-1, and at halftime, 6-2, but Great Britain came back well, so that the lead was only 9-7 after three quarters. Britain then scored two goals to equalize the match at 9, but Canada was too strong near the end and pulled ahead 14-9, before Great Britain scored a final goal to make it 14-10. (Some reports have the score as 14-11, but 14-10 is most often seen and is the score in the 1908 Official Report.)
Excellent sportsmanship was demonstrated during the match.  When Canada’s Angus Dillon broke his stick and was having difficulty finding a replacement, England’s R. G. Martin agreed to stay out until Dillon returned.  At the end of the game, the players exchanged sticks, shook hands and congratulated each other on a well-played match.
Previous Canadian lacrosse teams to visit England had been known simply as “The Canadians” and were usually from the Toronto area, but the Olympics marked the first time that a Canadian team had been selected on a nation-wide basis.  Several trial games were held before a team from clubs as far apart as New Westminster in the west and Montreal in the east was finally chosen.  The eventual make-up of the squad saw all parts of Canada represented: four members were from the Montreal Shamrocks, two from the Montreal Amateur Athletic Association, one from the Montreal Nationals, and two were from New Westminster.  One player each came from Calgary, Ottawa, Cornwall, Toronto, St. Catharines, and Orangeville.  The British also took unusual care over selection and the painstaking selection process adopted by both countries resulted in a game of the highest quality.

Their greatest challengers were the Swiss, whose trio of Walter Lüchinger, Alex Siebenhaar, and Walter Ludin, were runners-up in the last two European Championships. Other more distant threats were Belgium’s Hippolyte Mattelé and Eugeen Jacobs, part of the 1949 and 1950 European bronze medal-winning crews, who brought Kamiel Van Dooren with them to Helsinki, and Denmark’s Svend Pedersen, Poul Svendsen, and Jørgen Frantzen, who represented a recent strong national tradition in this event.
Switzerland’s failure to advance beyond the opening round was a surprise, almost as much as the strength of France, Germany, and the United States who, along with Italy, were the winners of the four heats. The Americans and the Belgians were eliminated in the semi-finals, with France’s trio of Raymond Salles, Gaston Mercier, and Bernard Malivoire posting the fastest time. They repeated this feat in the final, earning a gold medal and Malivoire the distinction, at age 14, of being the youngest gold medalist at the Games. Germany’s trio of Heinz Manchen, Helmut Heinhold, and Helmut Noll earned a surprise silver, while Denmark settled for bronze and Italy missed the podium entirely.

In the final, Halmay started quickly and led through 30 metres, when Daniels caught him.  At 50 metres, Daniels had a very slight lead.  At the finish he was ahead by ½ yard, while Halmay led Harald Julin by 2 yards.  Both Daniels and Halmay broke the old world record.

The world record was 41.8, but had been set in 1938 by Norway’s Hans Engnestangen, who was not competing in St. Moritz. Sweden’s Halle Janemar was also highly considered as he had won the 500 distance events at the 1946 Worlds and the 1947 Europeans. Of the Americans, Bobby Fitzgerald had won the US Olympic Trials, ahead of Del Lamb and Terry Browne (not on the team). The Norwegian qualification race took place in St. Moritz, a few days before the start of the Olympics. Sverre Farstad bested Thomas Byberg, winner of the 500 m at the Norwegian Championships and Torodd Hauer. The only skater from another country who might have stood a chance was Konstantin Kudryavtsev (USSR), who had set the season’s best time at that point. But with his country not competing in St. Moritz, leaving room for all four Americans and all four Norwegians to finish in the top eight.
Ice conditions were excellent throughout the race, allowing many skaters to set new personal bests. Already in the second pair, the Olympic Record, still dating from 1928, was broken. Cheered on by many of his countrymen, Bobby Fitzgerald sprinted to 43,2, a time that seemed fit for a medal. It was first approached by his team mate, Ken Henry, who crossed at 43,3. In the twelfth race, Finn Helgesen was up. Having narrowly qualified as the fourth Norwegian, he skated the race of his life. Shattering his pre-Olympic best of 43,7, he went one tenth faster than the leader. The Norwegian looked good for the gold medal, but some contenders remained in the second half of the field.
One of these was Ken Bartholomew (USA), who was drawn against Craig MacKay of Canada. The two false-started several times (sources disagree on the exact number, it may have been as much as thirteen), after which the pair was oddly withdrawn, only to try again after the 20th pair. When the race finally got underway, Bartholomew saw his Canadian opponent fall coming out of the final curve. Despite all this, the American still managed 43,2, tying with Fitzgerald. A third skater would join them two pairs later, as Thomas Byberg (Norway) finished his race in the same time. For the first time ever, three speed skaters shared a medal at the Olympics. The event turned into a virtual team meet between the United States and Norway, with each nation putting its four skaters among the top nine finishers, with Canada’s Frank Stack placing equal sixth.
The three silver medallists posed a problem to the organization, which only had two silver medals on hand. Therefore, it decided to hand out a bronze medal to one of the Americans, later to be replaced by one of the proper color. The American delegation picked Fitzgerald to receive the silver, and Bartholomew to receive the temporary bronze. This infuriated the temperamental Bartholomew, who refused to go to the medal ceremony. Instead, fifth-placed Ken Henry showed up, seemingly to receive this bronze medal on behalf of his team mate. But Henry kept the medal to himself, although he did win his own Olympic medal when he won the 1952 event in Oslo. It is not known if Bartholomew ever received his silver medal, but he was sent home by the US team leader immediately after the incident. Despite his status as one of the best American sprinters in the coming years, he was never again selected for international competition.

He had recently set the world record at the 1976 European Championships in Oslo, and had also won the distance at the 1975 Europeans and the 1974 World Championships. The race was held during a snowfall. The early leader was Hans van Helden, who had already won bronzes in Innsbruck in the 1,500 and 5,000, and who finished in 15:02.02. Stensen was up two pairs later and started faster and finished faster than Van Helden, crossing in 14:53.30. In the eighth pair was Piet Kleine, who had won a silver medal in the 5,000. Kleine started at a moderate pace, and was behind Stensen for 12 laps. But he then caught him, and gradually pulled away, finishing in 14:50.59, the second fastest time ever and only 0.28 off Stensen’s world record.
A few weeks later, Kleine won the 1976 World Championships, winning the 1,500 and 10K at that meet. One month later, at a meet in Inzell, West Germany, Kleine broke the world record in the 5,000, the 10,000, and the samalog. His gold medal also earned him a job. He was out of work, which he mentioned in an interview, and Dutch minister Harry van Doom found him one as a mailman. For Van Helden, Innsbruck was a successful Olympics, if not fully satisfying. He won three medals but they were all bronze. Stensen was near the end of his career. Primarily a distance skater, he was the 1974 World Champion and 1975 European Champion.

At the 1986 Worlds he had touched first but was later disqualified. His challengers were expected to be Canada’s Victor Davis, the eventual 1986 World Champion and Soviet Dmitry Volkov, runner-up at the 1987 Europeans to Moorhouse, and bronze medalist at the 1986 Worlds. But Volkov was recovering from a cut to his hand two months prior to Seoul and had missed a month of training.
This was the first men’s final of the 1988 Olympics, and Moorhouse did not start well, turning in sixth place, as Volkov had a big lead. Then Moorhouse came on and at the end he knew it was close between him and Volkov, and wasn’t certain he had won.

But Heiden tired on the last lap, and Jensen defeated her by a large margin on that lap, finishing in 4:32.13 to Heiden’s 4:33.77. The next pair had East German Sabine Becker, who had little international reputation at this level, as she had skated in the juniors thru 1979.

Andreasen also stumbled on his penultimate dive, but remained in third place. Sitzberger cemented the gold medal on his final effort, a back 1½ with 2½ twists. Gorman and Andreasen held on to finish second and third, respectively, as the Americans swept the medals, the last medal sweep in diving at the Olympics. Since 1984 only two divers are allowed per event, so this can no longer happen.
Japan’s Shunsuke Kaneto hit the springboard hard on his seventh (and final) dive, a 1½ with 1½ twists, sustaining an injured jaw, and was rushed to the hospital after being pulled from the water by Andreasen. But he was able to return and dive on platform a few days later.
Gorman was a Naval officer in 1964 but later went into investment banking. Life would not be so sweet for Sitzberger or Andreasen.

It was later revealed that he was soon to be a federal witness in a cocaine-trafficking investigation, and questions were raised about the circumstances of his death, but it was eventually ruled to be an accident.
In the 1980s Andreasen became obsessed with jumping off high bridges, diving 160 feet off the Gerald Desmond Bridge in Long Beach, California.

Meanwhile Valentin Demyanenko, formerly of Ukraine and now competing for Azerbaijan, was out to redeem himself after entering London as the favorite but exiting as the only canoeist eliminated in the preliminaries. Since then he had won the 2013 World Championships and been runner-up at that year’s European Championships. Also a potential threat was Russian Andrey Kraytor, the 2015 and 2016 European Champion and 2013 bronze medallist.
While Kraytor and Demyanenko won their preliminary heats, with the latter posting the fastest time of the round, Cheban conserved his strength in a heat won by Spain’s Alfonso Benavides, the 2014 European runner-up and 2013 World bronze medallist.

There were two leading contenders, with diametrically different running styles. On 2 February 1974, Tanzania’s Filbert Bayi won the greatest 1,500 run to that date, at the Commonwealth Games. His time of 3:32.16 was a world record, and he needed it to defeat John Walker of New Zealand, who placed second in 3:32.52, also surpassing the previous record. On 17 May 1975, at the International Freedom Games in Jamaica, Bayi then broke the world mile record with 3:51.0, but that mark would not last long. In Göteborg, Sweden, on 12 August, Walker became the first runner to break the 3:50 barrier, winning the mile in 3:49.4. Walker was a solid middle-distance runner with an excellent kick, while Bayi was an almost maniacal front runner who set what seemed to be suicidal paces. The Olympic match-up between them was highly anticipated.
But it never happened. Tanzania joined the African boycott of the Montréal Olympics and Bayi could not compete. In his absence, Walker seemed a cinch for the gold medal. But his 1976 form was not what it had been in 1974-75. He suffered from chronic compartment syndrome in both his lower legs, which would later require surgery, and he had to back off on his training, running shorter distances but of very high quality. Among the nine finalists in Montréal, only Ireland’s Eamonn Coghlan was a top miler, with many of the others being better known as 800 metre runners. The pace was quite slow, with Coghlan leading thru 800 and 1,200 metres in 2:03.15 and 3:01.23. Walker then took off on the backstretch and led out a 300 metre sprint. He quickly took the lead and his anerobic capacity held off the runners to win the gold medal, with Belgium’s Ivo Van Damme adding a silver medal to the one he had earned earlier in the 800. Before the end of the year, Van Damme was killed in a car crash. In his honor, the Ivo Damme Memorial athletics meeting is held annually in Brussels.

Besson was completely unheralded prior to the competition, but would place second in the 400 at the 1969 European Championships. Britain’s press was somewhat critical of Board, but later had cause to regret that. Within 18 months of the 1968 Olympics, she was diagnosed with cancer and died in December 1970, when she was only 22.
Another story concerned Dutch athlete Lia Hinten-Louer. The former pentathlete had concentrated on the 400 m since the Tokyo  Games and she flew to Mexico ranked fourth in the world having recently broken the national record. She felt unwell on arrival and, after visiting a doctor, discovered she was 10 weeks pregnant. Hinten-Louer withdrew from the Games and immediately retired from the sport.

The qualifying scoring was also different as it was a positive scoring system, rather than based on negative faults. The final round consisted of two rounds, again using the negative fault system, with both rounds to count for the final score. Only the top 20 riders and ties in the first final round advanced. German Olaf Petersen designed the course, which measured 770 metres in length, with verticals up to 1.60 metres. The largest oxer was 2.00 metres wide and the water jump measured 4.60 metres in width.
Gail Grennough had won the 1986 World Championship but was not named to the Canadian team for the 1988 Olympics. American Katharine Burdsall was the 1987 World Cup leader, but was also not at the Seoul Olympics. With several top riders out, the competition was considered wide open. In the final, West German Karsten Huck went clean in round one to lead narrowly over France’s Pierre Durand, Jr. (with 0.25 faults) and Canadian Ian Millar (with 0.75 faults). Thirteen riders tied for fourth with 4 faults. In the second round American Greg Best had the only clean ride to finish with 4 faults. Durand had only one fault to finish with 1.25 faults. Huck was the last rider and needed 1 or less faults, but hit the penultimate barrier and dropped back to a tie with Best, giving Durand the gold medal. In the jump-off Best and Huck both had 4 faults, but Best won the silver medal based on time.

Cassarà was also ranked first in the FIE rankings, although Aspromonte was seeded first in the Olympic tournament. Third Italian on the squad was Andrea Baldini. He had missed the 2008 Games, after it was reported he had failed a drug test. He was cleared of the accusations several months later, immediately earning the World and European titles of 2009. Germany had entered defending champion, Benjamin Kleibrink, and the four-time World Champion, Peter Joppich. Earlier in the 2012 season, Lei Sheng had earned the Asian title, while European gold was claimed by Aleksey Cheremisinov, two months before the Olympics.
The first casualties fell in the round of 32, where Kleibrink was served revenge by Yuki Ota, who had lost the 2008 Olympic final to him. Joppich suffered defeat at the hands of Alaaeldin Abouelkassem, the 2010 Junior World Champion. Abouelkassem, son of an Egyptian father and Algerian mother, had suffered his father’s death just a few months before the Olympics, but this did not stop him from upsetting also Cassarà in the quarter-finals. Lei Sheng, a three-time World Championship medallist, took care of the other two Italians, outscoring Aspromonte in the quarter-finals, and Baldini in the semis. The Chinese and the Egyptian met in the final, where Lei took a 8-5 lead in the first period. Abouelkassem recovered to lead by two points at 13-11, but then received four touches in a row to give the title to Lei. With the bronze taken by Choi Byeong-Cheol of South Korea, the entire podium was taken by non-European fencers. This had not happened since 1904, when only Cuban and American foil fencers competed.

The battle for bronze was quite close between the German Democratic Republic (East Germany), the United States, and Bulgaria. Unfortunately it came down to a decision with political overtones. During their uneven bars rotation, US alternate Rhonda Faehn was charged with removing the springboard used by the gymnasts to mount the bars. But instead of leaving the competition area, she stayed on the podium to watch Kelly Garrison-Steves perform her routine. For this the Americans were penalized 5/10ths of a point by the President of the Technical Committee of the Fédération Internationale de Gymnastique (FIG), Ellen Berger. Berger was from East Germany, and the penalty margin gave the bronze medal to East Germany, with the US finishing fourth, 3/10ths of a point behind.

He fell ill with Covid-19 the month before the start of the Games , with his arrival in Beijing delayed due to 10 days in quarantine. Krüger did his best to stay in good condition during isolation by using an exercise bike and walking laps of his hotel room.
The field was close together for a long time, and advances by individual runners were repeatedly thwarted. The pace wasn’t too high owing to the slow snow on the trail, and the athletes had to pace themselves on the demanding course. The first attacks came after about a third of the race. The field spread out for the first time and a group of about 15 runners was able to pull away. Halfway through the race, it was the Russians who dominated, notably with top favorite Bolshunov.
Eight runners tackled the last few km together and waited for the right moment to make the decisive attack. It was Bolshunov, who injected two decisive bursts of acceleration, at six kilometres then 2.6 kilometres from the finish, to leave his rivals trailing.
Johannes Høsflot Klæbo was considered one of the medal candidates on the shortened route. But the Norwegian, who had already won gold twice in Beijing, couldn’t keep up the pace halfway through the race and dropped out after 20 kilometres.

At that point, her coach decided she’d do a world record attempt - a race specifically to set a record, with Den Haan swimming alone against the clock.
Without Den Haan, swimmers from Germany and, ironically, Hungary assumed the mantle of favouritism.
The main beneficiary of the Dutch absence turned out to be Germany’s Ursula Happe. Happe, at 30 years of age and the mother of two children, was much the oldest of the swimming champions of 1956. She had retired from competition in 1955, after falling pregnant for the second time, but backtracked on her decision and decided to train for the Melbourne Olympics.

The early leader was Soviet skater Eduard Matusevich, who finished in 2:12.2 in the fifth pair. Järvinen was in the next pair but barely missed that time with 2:12.4. Antson went off in the eighth pair and finished in 2:10.3, a time that would bring him the gold medal. Dutchman Kees Verkerk started late, in the 21st pair, and matched Antson’s splits thru 1,100 metres, but finished slightly slower, in 2:10.6, and earned the silver medal. In 1992, when Estonia returned to the Olympic Games as an independent nation, Ants Antson was chosen to carry the Estonian flag at the Albertville Winter Olympic opening ceremony.

In the second semi, Sweden’s Susanna Kallur, who was expected to challenge for a medal, hit the first hurdle hard, fell to the track, and was out. The final started as expected with Jones ahead early and late. By the eighth hurdle she was two metres clear of the field and the gold medal seemed assured. But then she rammed the ninth hurdle and stumbled, almost falling; she stayed upright and was able to finish but had lost all momentum and finished seventh. Off the last hurdle, American Dawn Harper and Australian Sally McLellan were about equal, but Harper had much more speed on the run-in and won by 1/10th of a second.

Reneischi and Juravschi dominated the final, winning their second Olympic title of the Games (their first had been in the C-2 500) by a margin of over three seconds. Similarly, East Germany was able to take silver by just under three seconds, but Poland had to battle the Danish duo of Christian Frederiksen and Arne Nielsson to claim bronze, which it did by a margin of 0.61 seconds.

But it was perhaps another Dutch pair and second seeds, Alexander Brouwer and Robert Meeuwsen, who posed a bigger threat to the Brazilians. The third seeds were the Americans Nick Lucena and Phil Dalhausser  and were another fancied pairing. The reigning Olympic champions  Julius Brink and Jonas Reckermann did not defend their title because London 2012 was their last tournament together before Reckermann’s retirement.
All the fancied pairs made it out of their respective qualifying groups with the exception of the Latvian world number ones Aleksandrs Samoilovs and Jānis Šmēdiņš, who finished at the bottom of their group. The Dutch World Championship silver medallists Nummerdor and Varenhorst qualified despite losing to the Russians Vyacheslav Krasilnikov and Konstantin Semyonov. The Italians Alex Ranghieri and Adrian Carambula were in the same group as Alison and Bruno Schmidt but both pairs qualified despite each losing one match. Schmidt is the nephew of Brazilian Olympic basketball star and Hall of Famer Oscar Schmidt, who was the first man to score 1,000 points in an Olympic career.
The big surprise of the last 16 was the defeat of world number three Ranghieri and Carambula in straight sets by their fellow Italians Daniele Lupo and Paolo Nicolai, ranked 22 in the world and only in the last 16 after winning their lucky loser play-off match in three sets. The 2015 World Championship silver medallists Nummerdor and Varenhorst set up a quarter-final meeting with fellow countrymen Brouwer and Meeuwsen.
The quarter-finals were played in a very stiff breeze and the last eight saw Brouwer and Meeuwsen win the all-Netherlands clash in straight sets whilst the Brazilian favourites Alison and Bruno Schmidt beat the Americans Delhausser and Lucena 21-14, 12-21, 15-9. Lupo and Nicolai beat the Russian No.2 pair of Dmitry Barsuk and Nikita Lyamin in a close three-setter, 21-18, 20-22, 15-11, but Krasilnikov and Semenov did give Russia a team in the semi-finals after beating the Cuban duo of  Nivaldo Nadhir Díaz and Sergio Reynaldo González in the game of the round with the third deciding set going to 18-16, after the Russians had won the first set 22-20 and the Cubans the second 24-22.
The Brazilians were first to play in the semis and the enthusiastic home supporters were treated to a magnificent match at the end of which they got the result they wanted – but it was close. Brouwer and Meeuwsen pushed Alison and Bruno Schmidt in the first set before the Brazilians took it 21-17, but the number two seeds levelled it by winning a tight second set 23-21 and it was down to the deciding third set. Alison and Bruno Schmidt looked like easy winners as they raced to a 10-7 lead, but in no time they found themselves trailing 11-12. The lead then changed hands before the Brazilians went 14-13 up and then had their fifth match point of the night, but it was again saved. The home pair did not, however, let their sixth match point slip away as they won 16-14.
The other semi-final also went to three sets when the Italian outsiders, Nicolai and Lupo overcame a first set 15-21 reverse against the ninth seeded Krasilnikov and Semenov to win the next 21-16 and the decider 15-13. The bronze medal match was close with Brouwer and Meeuwsen  beating Krasilnikov and Semenov 23-21, 22-20 in their fifth win in six international meetings against the Russians. It was also the first ever medal won by Netherlands in Olympic beach volleyball.
The final was the fifth consecutive men’s final that had seen a Brazilian pair going for the top prize but on just one previous occasion, when Emanuel Rego and Ricardo Santos won in 2004, had they won the gold medal. For Italy, it was the first ever appearance in an Olympic beach volleyball final, male or female, and win or lose, it would be their first medal – they had never previously reached the semi-final in either competition.
After seeing the Brazilian women fail to win a gold medal, the full house at the Beach Volleyball Arena were hoping their two men, Alison and Bruno Schmidt could deliver, and they did not disappoint as they beat Nicolai and Lupo 21-19, 21-17 to become Olympic champions and add further gold to their 2015 world title. But the Italian pair, who had won their second European title in 2016, made it tough in the first set by racing into a 5-1 lead before the Brazilians then led 13-10. But they then let the Italian pair get into a commanding position at 19-18 before the home players. With the crowd behind them, the Brazilians won three points in a row to take the set 21-19. The Italians held a three point lead on four occasions in the second set. The last was at 11-8 before Alison and Bruno Schmidt took charge and ran out 21-17 winners, and for Alison Cerutti, it made up for his disappointment of a silver medal at London 2012.

In the final, Japan was no match for the USA team, which won its seventh consecutive gold medal, 90-75, but it was Japan’s first-ever basketball medal, either gender. France defeated Serbia for the bronze medal, reversing the result of the recent EuroBasket final.

Ulvang had been second to him in the 1991-92 World Cup and third in the 1992-93 season. He was a three-time champion at Holmenkollen in the 50 km (1989, 1991-92), and he was renowned in Norway, having been chosen to speak the Oath of the Athletes at the Lillehammer Opening Ceremony, but the 1993-94 season had been difficult for him. In November 1993, Ulvang’s brother, Kjetil, had been skiing home when he got lost in a blinding snowstorm and disappeared. Over the next weeks and months, Vegard Ulvang stopped training and began looking for his brother. At one press conference before Lillehammer, his emotions burst forth when he tearfully told the press corps that after the Winter Olympics, he would go back to looking for Kjetil, “I will look for him and I will find him.” They did find Kjetil, but sadly at the bottom of a lake where he had apparently fallen in the blizzard conditions. Vegard Ulvang competed at Lillehammer but at less than his best, and was not entered in the 30 km.
But by 1994 Dæhlie was the best cross-country skier in the world and was expected to win this event, especially since it was in freestyle, his stronger style. He started well and led at all checkpoints as he went through, starting in the 60th spot. But a few starters later, Finland’s Mika Myllylä posted a faster time at the first checkpoint, but he would not be able to maintain that pace, eventually dropping back to third place and the bronze medal.

The three top favorites, from three Scandinavian countries, presented themselves as the ones to beat over the following two weeks. During these Winter Games, these three would share eight of ten medals awarded in women’s individual distance cross-country events, with Pärmäkoski having the disadvantage of having weaker team-mates in the relay events.
Kalla began the race cautiously in the classical style, preferring to remain in the slipstream. For a long time, the race was determined by tactics, with Marit Bjørgen frequently varying the pace. During the slower phases, the top skiers were reluctant to take the lead, allowing Swotzerland’s Nathalie von Siebenthal to move up into first place. After the half-way mark, the event became an elimination race. While Bjørgen was in the rear part of the leading group of nine, Kalla started her decisive attack in a climb three kilometres from the finish. None of the group could follow her immediately, and Bjørgen first had to work her way through the pack to start the chase. She tried to close in on Kalla but was, of course, not supported by the second Swede Ebba Andersson. in third place.
When Kalla crossed the finish line in 40:44.9 minutes, she reversed the Sochi result, and Bjørgen had to settle for the silver medal, nine seconds behind. She prevented Bjørgen from winning her third consecutive gold medal in the skiathlon, and became the first Swede to win the Olympic title.

For the London Games the format of the knockout rounds had changed from the previous Olympics. In Beijing matches were decided over the cumulative score of 12 arrows but in 2012 matches consisted of up to 5 sets of 3 arrows (with 2 points to the winner of each set and 1 for a tie), winner was the first player to reach 6 points. In case of a tie, matches were decided with a single arrow, the one closest to the centre winning the match. In theory this should have made for a more dramatic, albeit unpredictable, tournament than before.
The first of the favourites to fall was Brady Ellison, at the second round stage, quickly followed by the new world record holder Im, who was defeated by Rick van der Ven, the European champion from the Netherlands.  Van der Ven was in turn ousted by [Takaharu Furukawa] of Japan in the semi-finals after a shoot-out and, by the same method, Oh Jin-Hyek sealed his place in the final by defeating China’s Dai Xiaoxiang. Oh had been the third best of the Koreans in the qualifying round but showed immaculate consistency in the knockout stages and won the gold medal against Furukawa by placing every one of his shots in the gold sector.  After he broke the jinx against Korean individual success in the men’s event he commented “It was a long way to come till this moment. I wanted no regrets. I shot every arrow as if it were my last.”

Kriss was a relative newcomer to the international scene, having made his first World Championships appearance in 1963, whilst Hoskyns had been World Champion in this discipline back in 1958. The two men had already met twice in the competition, one match a victory for Kriss and the other a tie, before resuming their rivalry in the final.

That was the only interruption in Hungarian domination of this event at the Olympics, as they won every other gold medal from 1908-64. But they would be challenged in 1924 by Dutchman Arie de Jong who had won the World Championships in 1922 and 1923. De Jong made it to the final, alongside four Italians, three Hungarians, two Frenchmen, Ivan Osiier of Denmark, who competed at the Olympics from 1908-48, and Argentine Horacio Casco, who would finish, not unexpectedly, last in the final. The final pool victor was expected to come from the Hungarians, the Italians, or perhaps de Jong.
But of the 12 finalists, only eight would end up competing in what would become the final pool. The Italians were drawn against each other initially and Oreste Puliti, by far their top fencer, defeated his three countrymen easily. But the Jury of Appeal, led by Hungarian judge György Kovács, ruled that the Italians had thrown their matches to Puliti to allow him a better chance to win gold. Puliti was incensed and threatened to cane Kovács, which caused the Jury to disqualify Puliti. The other three Italians then withdrew in protest, and the final proceeded without the four Italians. The anti-climactic final was actually quite close with three fencers – Sándor Posta (HUN), Roger Ducret (FRA), and János Garay (HUN) winning five bouts and meeting in a barrage for the medals, which Posta won by defeating both Ducret and Garay. Ducret’s silver medal gave him five medals in five events (he skipped team sabre) in Paris, with three golds – team foil and épée and individual foil.
Two days after the event Puliti saw Kovács at a music hall and resumed berating him. Kovács tried to avoid a scene by telling Puliti he could not understand Italian, so Puliti struck him in the face with his fist and said that perhaps he understood that. The men were separated and a formal duel was proposed.
The two combatants met again four months later at Nagykanizsa in southwestern Hungary, near the current Serbian border. The duel lasted for an hour, at which time the two were stopped by spectators who were concerned about the many wounds the two had received. Puliti and Kovács then shook hands and honor was restored.
The IOC convened a Jury of Honor to investigate this incident, an incident in men’s foil team, and several incidents in boxing also involving bad sportsmanship.  The Jury of Honor issued a report in March of 1925 banning Puliti from any further Olympic competition.  Two years later, the Italian fencing federation asked for this decision to be reconsidered saying that Puliti had only been following the instructions of his team captain.  Puliti was allowed to compete in the 1928 Olympics where he competed in the individual foil competition, finishing fourth, and was a member of the Italian foil team that won the gold medal and sabre team that won a silver medal.

Away from the Finn the picture was not so clear as the expected challengers from Norway, Austria and East Germany had faltered on the smaller hill and others, notably Pavel Ploc and his Czechoslovak teammates, had excelled where the more favoured failed. 
Strong winds meant that the competition had to be postponed on four occasions but when it was eventually held Nykänen’s first jump of 120.5 m was the longest ever recorded in Olympic competition and virtually ensured that he would win the gold medal. The strong Norwegian tradition was upheld by Erik Johnsen who finished second a week after placing 41st in on the normal hill. Just 0.2 of a point behind Johnsen was Matjaž Debelak, the first Yugoslav ski jumper to win an Olympic title.
Dead last was the eccentric Briton Eddie “The Eagle” Edwards who narrowly avoided the embarrassment of scoring half the points of the penultimate finisher. It needs to be pointed out though that the next-to-last jumper, Todd Gillman of Canada, had fallen on his second jump.
The stories of Eddie Edwards and Matti Nykänen have come together and moved apart over the decades. The fame gained by their Olympic appearances was exploited to the point where both men reached the top of the Finnish pop charts but financial problems were to haunt them throughout the nineties. This is where the stories part company. Eddie Edwards recovered from bankruptcy, became a qualified lawyer and shares his time between the law, the building industry, his wife and children and the celebrity circuit. Nykänen’s life spiraled into alcoholism and violence and in 2004 he was convicted of assault when he stabbed a friend after an argument over a finger pulling competition. Married five times Nykänen has also served prison time for domestic violence and at one point was reduced to working as a stripper.

The final started as expected as Groß went out fast, trailed early by Vidal. Morales made his move at 100 metres. Sieben was out in lane six, unwatched by the crowd and the other swimmers, but by the final turn he had moved to Vidal’s shoulder, who was in lane five. In the last 25 metres it was very close, with all four swimmers coming to the wall almost together and no one was certain who had won. In one of the biggest upsets in Olympic swimming history, it was Jon Sieben, who said later, “I only knew I’d won when I turned around and saw on the board.” Sieben finished in a world record 1:57.04, 1/100th of a second ahead of Groß’s mark, with Groß in second, Vidal and third, and Morales pushed off the podium despite swimming 1:57.75.

In Hakuba she would again win five medals, with three gold medals. One of the gold medals came in this race, which she won by 4.8 seconds over Czech skier Kateřina Neumannová.
Neumannová had competed at the 1992 and 1994 Winter Olympics and at the 1996 Olympics in mountain biking. She would compete again at the 2002 and 2006 Winter Olympics. Lazutina also competed at the 2002 Winter Olympics, but would be disqualified for doping, testing positive for darbopoietin, an erythropoietin analogue.

Not present in Lillehammer were the two men who had shown dominance in Albertville. Martin Höllwarth and Toni Nieminen were still teenagers in 1994 but had already suffered a collapse in form which left them out of their respective national teams.
The large and vociferous crowd was thrilled by the leap of Espen Bredesen in the first round as he sailed into the distance before coming to earth at the 135.5 m mark. This gave him a healthy lead at the half way point but gathering behind were his two great rivals Goldberger and Weißflog. The second set of jumps changed everything. It wasn’t that Bredesen performed badly, merely that Weißflog was magnificent as he produced a leap eleven metres ahead of his rival and became the first German to win this event since 1960.  Jens Weißflog was the only winner from Sarajevo to repeat in Lillehammer and it came after his career stalled as he failed to adapt to the new demands of the V-technique and the post-unification German coaching system.

Her return to competition was warmly welcomed by her fellow contestants and she could not have wished for a better outcome. It was apparent the two Chinese girls were going to be too much of an obstacle to overcome, but Biles put in the performance of her life.
Tang was the second gymnast to go, and her 14.233 put her in the lead, but with Biles and Guan still to go. The American was next up and put herself into second place with a 14.000. After the recently crowned individual all-round champion Sunisa Lee finished on 13.866 and the remaining three contestants all finished below Biles, it was suddenly apparent she was winning a medal, although, with Guan still to go, it was unlikely to stay at silver and a polished performance saw her win China’s first women’s gymnastics gold of the Games, and secure another 1-2 for China, thanks to a score of 14.633. It was also the first women’s gymnastics gold for China since Deng Linlin, also on the beam, at London 2012.
The story of this event was not about yet more Chinese domination, but it was about the emotional, and successful return to the sport for one of its most popular characters, Simone Biles who had overcome what had been known as the “twisties”, a term used when a gymnastics body and brain seem to stop working together. The applause from everybody inside the Ariake Gymnastics Centre for Biles, before and after her routine, was one of those moments that will remain in the memory of those present for a long time to come.

This original result would stand for five years but in 2013 it was announced that  a retest of a urine sample given by Mikhnevich at the 2005 IAAF World Athletics Championships had, with the use of updated testing techniques, revealed the presence of no less than three banned substances. Since the Belarussian had previously served a doping ban between 2001 and 2003, this second offense was punishable by a lifetime suspension and all of his performances since the 2005 World Championships were automatically voided by the IAAF.  In 2014 the Canadian Olympic Committee announced that the IOC had confirmed that Armstrong was promoted to the bronze medal position in place of Mikhnevich.

He had to move down in weight to compete in the 68 kg. class at Sydney.  But Bonehkohal was upset in the semi-finals by Korea’s Sin Joon-Sik.  In the final, Sin faced Steve Lopez of the United States. Lopez was a five-time US champion who had won the 1999 Pan-American Games gold medal.  Lopez came from a family with three siblings who were world class taekwondo fighters, brothers Jean and Mark, and sister Diana.  Diana and Mark narrowly failed to make the qualifying for the Sydney Olympics, but both would become World Champions in 2005.  In the Olympic final, Lopez and Sin were tied near the end of the match when the referee, Flavio Pérez of Colombia, deducted a point from Sin’s score because of penalties he had incurred during the match.  This was not in accordance with the taekwondo rules and Pérez was suspended for this action but the result was allowed to stand.

African men had been world-class distance runners since the early 1960s, but women were only becoming liberated enough to compete internationally. At the Tianjin marathon in April 1993, Chinese women finished in the eight places, all under 2-26, and four of them moved in to the world top 10 list. This followed several other stunning times by Chinese female distance runners, but many of these were later discredited when systematic doping regimens were revealed in the Chinese athletics hierarchy.
Portugal had a new women’s marathon star in Manuela Machado, who won the 1994 European Championships and the 1995 World Championships. Germany’s Uta Pippig had won the Boston Marathon in 1994-96 and was highly considered. The top African woman was likely Kenya’s Tegla Leroupe, who won the 1994 New York Marathon.
To avoid the summer heat of Atlanta, the race started at 7:05 AM, the morning after the bombing at the Centennial Olympic Park. Pippig took the early lead and led by 13 seconds at five kilometers, and she increased this to 28 second at 10 km. At 20 km. she was caught by Ethiopia’s Fatuma Roba and Pippig was also overtaken by defending champion Valentina Yegorova, Machado, Japan’s silver medalist from 1992, Yuko Arimori, and Romania’s Lidia Şimon. Pippig would eventually drop out. Roba powered ahead and held a 28-second lead at 25 km. She ran unchallenged to a 2-minute victory in a time of 2-26:05, considered very fast on the hilly course, in the Southern summer weather. Yegorova won the silver medal, and Arimori the bronze medal. Machado faded to seventh place, trailing Simon by one spot.

As the last men’s race of the Olympics, the USA had some incentive to win as they had not won an individual running event at Tokyo, the first time that had ever happened at the Olympics.
The heats were extremely fast as all eight qualifiers bettered 3 minutes, the first time that had ever happened at a major meet. In the final Michael Cherry led off for the USA but Botswana’s Isaac Makwala led at the end of the first lap, recording a 43.9 leg, with Cherry and the United States second, and Trinidad & Tobago’s Deon Lendore third.
Michael Norman ran the second leg for the USA, and pulled ahead on the final curve, opening up a three-metre lead on the baton pass to Bryce Deadmon. Deadmon ran the fastest third leg, 44.01, and gave the USA a safe six-metre lead as he passed to 400 hurdler Rai Benjamin for the anchor. Benjamin had no challenges but still ran 43.40, the fastest leg of the race, as the United States won gold in 2:55.70, the fourth fastest mark all-time.
Behind the USA the times were also fast, and a close battle brought the Netherlands home for the silver medal with a national record 2:57.18, with Botswana taking bronze, and Belgium ran a national record 2:57.88 to finish fourth. Botswana had run 2:57.27, both a national and African record.

The second seed was Kazakh wrestler Yusup Batirmurzaev, who was the 2020 Asian Games Champion.
Only USA wrestling aficionados considered the American entrant in the class, with the unusual name of Gable Steveson, the surname often misspelled as Stevenson. Steveson was born to be a wrestler, as he was named for American wrestling icon Dan Gable, and had just finished his junior year in college at the University of Minnesota, winning the NCAA title shortly before the USA Olympic Trials. Steveson had no significant international record at the senior level.
The opening round saw the first surprise as Batirmuzaev was beaten on fall by German Gennadij Cudinovic. Petriashvili was moving steadily towards the final as Steveson also surprised the #3 seed, Turkey’s Taha Akgul, in the quarter-finals, winning on points, 8-0.
Petriashvili and Steveson won their semis to meet in the final, where Steveson went out to an early lead, 4-0. Petriashvili came back strongly and went ahead, 8-5, with 1:30 left in the match, which held until only 10 seconds remained, when Steveson scored a takedown to make it 8-7. With only ½-second left Steveson pulled off another takedown to win the gold medal, 10-8.
Shortly after the Olympics, Steveson signed a professional contract with WWE (World Wrestling Entertainment), although the contract was fashioned as an NIL (name-image-likeness) arrangement so that he could return to wrestle for his senior year at Minnesota.

But to the IOC, baseball had problems as an Olympic sport. In 2005, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) began an investigation into the sports on the Olympic Program. Several new sports, including golf, rugby sevens, and karate, were attempting to get onto the Olympic Program and the IOC wanted to keep the program stable in terms of number of sports. If it was going to add any new sports, some older sports would have to be removed from the Olympics. Baseball was felt to be at risk to be removed, because of doping problems in the American professional leagues, because the top American professionals from Major League Baseball did not play in the Olympics, the relatively high cost of constructing a baseball stadium that would not be used in many countries, the relatively few number of nations that competed internationally at a high level, and since Olympic baseball was far from the top competition in the sport – all criteria the IOC considered important. But when the IOC met to reconsider the Olympic Program, an unusual thing happened. No sports were added to the Olympic Program but baseball was removed, as was softball, which was felt to be guilty by association. Thus, unless the IOC reconsiders, the 2008 tournament was to be the last one for baseball at the Olympics, although the International Baseball Federation continues to appeal to be reinstated to the program.
The dominant team in amateur baseball since the mid-1950s had been Cuba, and they had won the gold medals in 1992, 1996, and 2004, with the United States winning in 2000. But Cuba was losing some of that dominance, related to a number of reasons. The fall of the Soviet Union, and their financial support thru the 1980s, caused some problems. But many Cuban players were also defecting to the United States, lured by the promise of big money in major league baseball. Cuba had still won the World Cup in 2001, 2003, and 2005, but the United States defeated them in 2007. And in 2006, Major League Baseball sponsored the World Baseball Classic, which matched national teams, including pros from the Major Leagues. Played before the start of the Major League season, it was won by Japan. In younger divisions, Korea had won the World Junior Baseball Championship in 2000, 2006, and 2008.
As it had since 1992, the 2008 tournament consisted of eight teams playing a round-robin tournament, followed by elimination games. Korea won the round-robin, defeating Cuba 7-4, with the United States third, losing only to Cuba and Korea. The semi-finals matched Cuba against the United States and Korea versus Japan. Cuba routed the US, 10-2, while Korea advanced to the final with a 6-2 victory over Japan. The final was a nail biter, but Korea won their first, and possibly last, Olympic baseball gold medal, 3-2.

Another top sprinter was Barney Ewell, but he had been at his best during the war years and was felt to be slightly past his prime. One athlete who would not compete in London was Hal Davis, who would have been favored in either 1940 or 1944 if the Olympics had not been lost to the war. An unusual thing happened at the US Olympic Trials. The heavy favorite in the high hurdles was Harrison Dillard, who had not lost a hurdle race in several years, but he hit a hurdle in the final of the Trials and did not finish. Fortunately for him, he had also entered the 100 metres and made the team in that event behind Patton and Ewell. In the Olympic final, Patton got off to a disastrous start and was not a factor.

At the 1993 World Championships, they had been 1-2 in a photo finish, which at first looked like Smirnov had won. His torso was first across the line, but on review, Dæhlie’s boot crossed the line first, which is the determining factor. Smirnov had been second in the 10 km classical in Lillehammer, so he would start only 18 seconds behind Dæhlie. But it might as well have been 18 minutes.

Zhelezovsky and Klevchenya started in the very first pair. Klevchenya went off fastest, but was caught by the Belarussian’s usual strong final lap. With 1:12.72, Zhelezovsky was not far off the world record, and Klevchenya trailed at 1:12.85. Three pairs later, Dan Jansen started. At 600 m, he was faster than both Zhelezovsky and Klevchenya, but then had a slight mishap in the first curve of the last lap. But Jansen went on to finish strongly, coming home in a world record of 1:12.43. It was immediately clear this would be the winning time, and Jansen could finally celebrate at the Olympics. At the press conference, he was congratulated by phone by US President Bill Clinton, a courtesy not extended to other American winners at these Games. Like Jansen, Zhelezovsky also ended his career, but with an Olympic silver medal, the first one ever for Belarus.
The victory was an emotional one for Jansen and his family but also for all his fans. He had been either the best or second-best sprinter in the world since around 1988, but had known nothing but disappointment at the Olympics, starting with the 1988 Calgary 500, when he stumbled and fell at 100 metres, having to start the race only hours after hearing that his sister, Jane, had died from leukemia. But he had always faced his defeats with grace and magnanimity. The Official Report of the 1994 Olympic Winter Games wrote, “At the moment there were no Norwegians, Dutch, Americans, or people of other nationalities among the spectators, only fans of Dan Jansen.” When his world record time was announced, his fellow competitors yelled and cheered for him. Jansen skated an emotional victory lap, carrying his 8½-month-old daughter in his arms. Her name was Jane.

They met in the pool semi-final, but Canu was hurt by then, and offered little opposition. The pool finals matched Seisenbacher against Akinobu Osako (JPN), who had been the most impressive judoka in the early going, and Vladimir Shestakov (URS) against Holland’s Ben Spijkers. Seisenbacher and Shestakov were too much for their opponents and advanced to the final. Only a few months before the Olympics, Shestakov had defeated Seisenbacher at a tournament in the Soviet Union. But in Seoul, Seisenbacker outlasted Shestakov to win by yusei-gachi and become the first judoka to defend a class gold medal at the Olympics.
In the repêchage, Spijkers faced Britain’s Densign White. They were old friends, having first faced each other years before at the European Junior Championships. Spijkers won the match with waza-ari gasete. Per judo protocol, they quickly bowed to the judges. But against protocol, they then spontaneously walked off the mat arm-in-arm. The referee called them back to the mat, asking them to follow the judo guidelines. This time they performed the more formal bow, and began to walk off with guides, when they again embraced and walked off together. The crowd loved it and roared its approval, and this time the referee had little choice but to allow the breech of protocol.

She had been less successful at the World Championships, however, earning bronze in 2013 and silver in 2015. Her main competitor here was Australian Kim Brennan, the 2012 Olympic bronze medalist and 2013 and 2015 World Champion. At the Worlds over the last three years, Brennan had been bested only by New Zealand’s Emma Twigg in 2014; Twigg was also the World silver medalist in 2013, bronze medalist in 2010 and 2011, and had come in fourth in London. The only other Rio competitor to medal at the World Championships was China’s Duan Jingli, who had taken bronze in 2014 and 2015, while the 2016 European Champion was Magdalena Lobnig of Austria.
Jungli, Lobnig, and Twigg all won their preliminary heats, while Knapková came second in Lobnig’s heat and Brennan came in third behind Kenia Lechuga of Mexico and 2013 and 2014 African Champion Micheen Thornycroft of Zimbabwe. Twigg, Knapková, and Lechuga advanced in the first quarterfinal and Brennan and Duan in the fourth, with Thornycroft finishing behind 2012 Olympic silver medalist Fie Udby Erichsen of Denmark in quarterfinal three. The second quarterfinal was perhaps the most interesting, as it was won by American Gevvie Stone, not considered a serious medal contender, with Lobnig coming in third behind Jeanine Gmelin of Switzerland, the 2015 European silver medalist.
Four of these competitors were eliminated in the semifinals: Thornycroft, Lechuga, Erichsen and, most surprisingly, Knapková, who was beaten by Duan, Stone, and Lobnig. This left Brennan in the best position to capture gold, which she did leading almost the entire race. Stone was the only other rower close to Brennan by the end and thus earned silver, with Duan edging out Twigg by 0.35 seconds to round out the podium. The event marked the first foray into Olympic rowing for the Bahamas, Singapore, Nigeria, Togo, and Trinidad and Tobago, thanks to the participation of Emily Morley, Saiyidah Aisyah, Chierika Ukogu, Akossiwa Claire Ayivon, and Felice Chow respectively. Michelle Pearson, meanwhile, was Bermuda’s first Olympic rower since 1972.

Varga had also been runner-up at the 1967 Worlds and 1968 Europeans. Traykov won his first bout by a disqualification, but was then pinned by Baciu and was eliminated when he lost by disqualification to American Dave Hazewinkel. In round six Baciu and Varga met for the gold medal, and when the match ended in a draw, Baciu was eliminated, gold going to Varga. In the matches for the lesser medals, Baciu threw Greek Othon Moskhidis and advanced to a silver medal match against Soviet Ivan Kochergin. Baciu and Kochergin were both disqualified in that match, but that still gave the silver medal to Baciu, as Kochergin and Moskhidis had drawn in round six.
Varga and Baciu would return to the Olympics in 1972, but neither medalled, with Varga finishing fourth and Baciu sixth. Varga did win the 1970 World and European Championships. Traykov would win the 1972-73 Europeans.

But she was out of the Olympics in 2012 with an injury, opening it up a little bit. The surprise Beijing gold medalist had been Belgian Tia Hellebaut, who promptly retired to have a baby, but she returned to jumping in late 2011, although she was less of a factor. With those two not available at top form, the favorite going in was Anna Chicherova, the Russian who had won the 2011 Worlds. Her biggest competition was expected to be American Chaunté Lowe.
In the end it was all Chicherova who started with an opening clearance at 1.89, and was perfect through 2.03. Lowe struggled, going out at 2.00 and would finish only sixth due to misses. Surprising young American Brigetta Barrett cleared 2.03 on her second attempt, to place her second at that time, and Russian Svetlana Shkolina also cleared, on her third attempt, placing her third. All three attempted 2.05, but only Chicherova was successful, after one miss, giving her the gold medal. Barrett secured the silver and Shkolina the bronze. Hellebaut placed fifth.

The 35-year-old Cancellara had a record seven world championship medals to his credit, including four golds in the five years 2006-10, whilst Martin, runner-up to Wiggins in 2012, had won six world championship medals going back to 2009, and was the winner in three successive years 2011-13. Also in the field was the 2015 World Champion Vasily Kiriyenko of Belarus, Tour de France winner and bronze medallist at London in 2012 Chris Froome from Great Britain and Australia’s Rohan Dennis, who won the 13.8km stage one time trial at Utrecht in the 2015 Tour de France with a speed of 55.446 km/h, the fastest ever stage win in the history of the Tour.
There were no changes in the format since London 2012, with the 35 starters setting off at 90-second intervals over the 54.4 km circuit which started from Tim Maia Square in Pontal, west Rio de Janeiro. After a 2.5 km ride on the flat, the riders entered the 24.7 km Grumari circuit, which they completed two laps of before the ride back to the starting point.
Namibia’s Dan Craven was the first to set off at 10.00 am but his time of 18:09.45 for the first split was a time that would be bettered by all the other 34 riders and indeed he eventually finished the race in last place, more than 15 ½ minutes behind the winner. But eyes were on the last riders to set off as this group contained all the fancied riders and it was one of the pre-race favourites, Fabian Cancellara, the 2008 Beijing gold medallist, who led from the Australian Rohan Dennis with Britain’s Geraint Thomas in third place at the first split.
Cancellara slipped to fourth place at split two while Dennis moved into the lead with the Netherlands Tom Dumoulin moving from fourth to second, and with Spain’s Jonathan Castroviejo moving into the bronze medal position.
It all changed again at split three when Cancellara was back in the lead with Dennis down to second, after he had to change bikes after his handlebar snapped, and Dumoulin holding on to third place with Chris Froome breathing down his neck. With only the ninth best time in split four, Dennis was out of the medal positions in fourth place whilst Froome was into third, Dumoulin up to second place and Cancellara holding on to the lead.
The honour of returning the fastest time in the fifth and final section belonged to Nélson Oliveira of Portugal but he could only finish seventh overall while the top three each held on to their respective places which meant Fabian Cancellara regained the title he last won in Beijing eight years earlier in what was to be his final international race in an illustrious career that has seen him win eight stages in the Tour de France and 29 yellow jerseys, the most by any rider never to have won the race. For Dumoulin, he had the honour of winning the first men’s time trial medal for the Netherlands.
As for the much-fancied Tony Martin, Rio was a disaster and the nearest he got to a medal place was in recording the fifth best time in split one, but after that he got progressively worse and was classified 12th with the reigning World Champion Kiryienko even further back in 17th place.

From the quarter-finals onwards, all matches were best two of three races. Morelon took part in nine races and won them all, facing minimal challenges en route to the gold medal. In the semi-finals he took out the Netherlands’ Klaas Balk.

Skeptics noted that Chinese men had not won a single medal at these championships and pointed the similarity of these performances to those of swimmers of the German Democratic Republic during their glory years of the 1970s and 80s. The most outspoken critics also noted that a number of coaches from the now discredited East German regime were now plying their trade in China. These fears appeared to be proved true when eleven athletes tested positive for dihydrotestosterone at the 1994 Asian Games.
Le Jingyi was the only one of this generation of Chinese swimmers who arrived at the Atlanta Olympics as the clear favourite. Although she was not swimming as fast as she had done in 1994 she was still comfortably the best over the distance and was a relatively easy winner of the Olympic title.

In the opening round, Hungary came in second to the Romanian duo of Antonel Borşan and Marcel Glăvan, while Moldova was relegated to the semi-finals in a heat won by Dittmer and Kirchbach.

At Sydney Goliath was present in the person of Aleksandr Karelin, Olympic champion in this class in 1988, 1992, and 1996, a 9-time World Champion, and a 12-time European Champion. Karelin had not been defeated since 1987 in any match. He was unscored upon in his preliminary matches and advanced to the final against the American David, Rulon Gardner, who had lost to Karelin at the 1997 Worlds. The match was scoreless through the first period, but in the second period, Karelin lost a hand-grip and the judges awarded Gardner a point after reviewing the tape. That was all that was needed, as Gardner held on to win, 1-0, in what is considered the biggest upset in Olympic wrestling history.
Karelin retired after the Sydney Olympics and later entered politics. Gardner had a difficult time, almost dying once in the Wyoming winter wilderness in 2002 after he was stranded, and losing a toe to frostbite. He then almost died when a small plane in which he was flying crashed into frigid lake waters in Utah, and he and his companions were forced to swim for an hour to reach shore. Gardner would return to the 2004 Olympics and win a bronze medal. He later gained a lot of weight, and attempted to lose it to compete at the 2008 Olympics, but was unsuccessful. He did fight once in professional mixed martial arts.

The only other recent major international medalists were Renate Breuer of West Germany (bronze at the 1965 European Championships) and Marcia Jones Smoke (bronze at the 1964 Summer Olympics).  Jones Smoke came in fourth in Pinayeva’s heat, although she won the repêchage, while Breuer was second to Romania’s Viorica Dumitru in the other one. The tables were turned in the final, however, with Breuer finishing nearly half a second ahead of Dumitru, who in turn took bronze a good distance ahead of fourth-placed Smoke Jones.

Xie was the winner of the last two World Championships, as well as the 2018 World Cup, whereas Wang was the 2019 one-metre world champion. The major threat to the Chinese was from Britain’s Jack Laugher, the 2016 Rio silver medallist and 2019 3-metre FINA World Series winner.
In the preliminary round, it was the Chinese pair who dominated and, despite Xie leading after the first dive, it was Wang who lead after dive number two, and remained in the lead to qualify ahead of Xie, who scored the only 100 of qualifying with a magnificent forward four-and-a-half somersaults in his fifth and final dive. Laugher was second after the first dive but two disastrous rounds followed as he slipped to 12th, before recovering to qualify in sixth place, two places below the other Briton James Heatly. Mexico’s Rommel Pacheco qualified in third place.
Again, the semi-final was dominated by just two men, Xie and Wang, while the British pair of Heatly and Laugher qualified in third and fourth place. Xie’s final dive was a forward 4.5 somersaults in tuck that saw him score 100.70 points as he led his compatriot by nearly three points with Laugher nearly 50 points behind in fourth and Heatly, the grandson of the 1948 and 1952 Olympic diver Peter Heatly, a further 60 points behind Laugher.
The final belonged to just one man, Xie Siyi, who led from start to finish while Wang occupied second place throughout, except for after dive two, when Laugher briefly moved into the silver medal position. From the half-way mark, the three medal positions were almost certainly going to go to the two Chinese divers and Laugher.
Laugher was guaranteed a medal after temporarily taking the lead with his sixth and final dive. Wang went next and his forward 4.5 somersaults in tuck was good enough to put him ahead of Laugher with 102.60 and then the two-time world champion Xie Siyi matched Wang’s dive to score the same points and win the gold by nearly 24 points. For Xie Siyi it made up of missing the Rio Games because of a broken ankle. There were emotional scenes at the end of the competition as Mexico’s Rommel Pacheco bowed out of Olympic competition after appearing at four Games since 2004. He finished sixth in his finale.

The Finns, who had taken all the medals at the 1954 World Championships with Veikko Hakulinen winning, was favored among most of the experts. But the defending champion from 1952, Hallgeir Brenden of Norway, was eager to revenge his disappointing 14th place in the 30 km. His form prior to Cortina had been in flux – at times he looked superb but a toe injury in December had slowed him and he had not won any of the Norwegian selection races. The Soviet skiers were considered better on the longer distances.
On a foggy and snowy day, Brenden starting first among the favourites, and took the lead after 5 km., 13 seconds ahead of Vladimir Kuzin with Sixten Jernberg one second behind Kuzin. Hakulinen was seventh, 25 seconds behind. During the following 5 km., Brenden increased his lead. At 10 km. he was 21 seconds ahead of Pavel Kolchin, who had advanced from fourth place at 5 km. Jernberg, still in contention for a medal, was nine seconds behind Kolchin, but Kuzin was obviously in trouble, falling back to fourth place.
At the finish, Soviet skier Nikolay Anikin, who started 18th, had the best time until Martin Stokken was able to take the lead. Brenden was able to keep his speed and finished with a time over one minute better than Stokken. Kolchin was able to stay ahead of Hakulinen and was in silver medal position, but Jernberg with his late start number of 56, had a good finish and secured his second silver medal, three seconds better than Kolchin.
Hallgeir Brenden, a 26-year-old lumberjack from Trysil, had defended his title, the first cross-country skier to do this at the Olympics. He was an outspoken and extremely popular man, and the picture of him with Italian movie star Sophia Loren on his knee went all over the world and contributed to his rising international fame.

America’s Larry Shields tried to pass on the backstretch, as Ray faded.  Baker fought off Shields, allowing Hill to pull away on the final stretch.  Philip Baker, a Quaker pacifist, later known as Philip Noel-Baker, became a well-known peace activist and proponent of nuclear disarmament in the 1950’s.  Noel-Baker was instrumental in the formation of the League of Nations, helping to draft its Covenant, and was briefly the assistant to the secretary-general of the League, Eric Drummond.  He served in the British Parliament for 36 years and for his efforts, in 1959 he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.

The Ordinal Placement for each judge was based on Total Points awarded by that judge to the skaters.  The points were based on 50% for Compulsory Figures and 50% for Free Skating, with the tiebreaker for each judge being Compulsory Figure Points.  Final placement was determined by a Majority Placement rule.  Thus, if a skater was ranked first by a majority of the judges, that skater was placed first overall, and the process was repeated for each place.  Ties broken by a Subsequent Majority rule, i.e., if the pairs were ranked for the same position by the same number of judges, Majority Placement for the next higher position for each pair determined who was ranked higher.  The tiebreakers were, in order: 1) Number of Majority Placements, 2) Total Ordinals of Majority, 3) Total Ordinals, 4) Total Points, 5) Compulsory Figure Points.",na,"The 1972 Olympic women’s event was one of the most important figure skating events ever, as it would eventually lead to the demise of compulsory figures. Prior to the 1971 World Championships, compulsories counted 60% of a judge’s score, with free skating counting only 40%. But skaters and coaches had been wishing to reverse this, and by 1972, it was changed to a 50-50 mix. One skater who did not want the rules changed was Austria’s Beatrix “Trixi” Schuba, the 1971-72 European Champion and 1971 World Champion, who was not a great free skater but was dominant in the school figures. Her diametric opposite was American Janet Lynn, US champion since 1969, who some figure skating experts still consider the greatest female free skater ever. In Sapporo, the competition was over after the compulsory figures. Schuba led easily over the second American Julie Lynn Holmes, with Janet Lynn in fourth place. As expected Lynn won the free skating comfortably over Canada’s Karen Magnussen. Schuba and Holmes fared poorly in the free skate – Schuba placing seventh and Holmes eighth. But because of the rules in place, Schuba still won the gold – ranked first by all nine judges. Her seventh place in free skating is the worst ever performance in that section by an Olympic gold medalist, and she was actually booed by the crowd because of her mediocre free program. Holmes fell to fourth, as Magnussen won the silver and Janet Lynn the bronze medal.
Because of her difficulties with compulsory figures, Janet Lynn would never win a major international championship. But because of the furor made over the lack of respect her mystical free skating received from the judges, the rules would be changed several times over the next few years to make compulsory figures less important. Eventually they would be eliminated altogether after 1991. Thru the 1990s, American figure skaters would study tapes of Janet Lynn in free skating, trying to learn from the master. Lynn, incidentally, was her middle name, as she was born Janet Lynn Nowicki. But when she became a top skater, her parents thought Janet Lynn would give her better marquee value, and she always competed under that name as a senior.
One skater who was strangely absent in 1972 was East Germany Gabi Seyfert. Seyfert had won the silver medal at the 1968 Winter Olympics, and was then World and European Champion in 1969-70. But she then disappeared from competition. She fell in love with Eberhard Rüger, an ice dancer, and they married, although it is not clear why she stopped competing.

Also highly considered was her teammate, Ellie Daniel, one of the few US female swimmers who had competed at Mexico City, where she won a bronze in this event. Daniel had set three world records in the 200 fly in 1971. Daniel took the lead in the final on the first lap over the 100 butterfly champion, Mayumi Aoki, but East German Rosemarie Kother moved ahead by 100 metres. Kother still led at 150, but off the turn Daniel moved back into the lead, closely chased by Karen Moe. Moe took the lead for good at 170 metres, and almost at the same time American Lynn Colella passed both Daniel and Kother. Moe hung on the gold medal and led a USA sweep, with Colella in second and Daniel repeating her bronze medal from Mexico. Over the next four years Rosemarie Kother, later Rosemarie Gabriel, would become the top swimmer in the world in this event, winning the title at the 1973 and 1975 World Championships, and setting five consecutive world records.

The strongest challenges to Kelley Law’s Canadian team were expected to come from Switzerland, Sweden and Denmark.
As expected Canada topped the round-robin stage winning 8 out of 9 games and losing only by a single shot to fellow semi-final qualifiers Switzerland. The race for the other two semi-final places turned into a dogfight as Britain, who were in prime position to qualify, lost their last two matches and were overtaken by the USA for third place. Germany needed to beat the already qualified Swiss to finish a clear fourth but a Swiss victory meant that Germany, Sweden and Great Britain would face a play-off series.
The Brits, who had somewhat fallen apart in the last round-robin matches regained the form they had shown earlier in the competition and came through the two tie-breakers to clinch a semi-final meeting with the Canadians.
Switzerland convincingly beat the USA in the first semi-final but the second semi was a prime lesson in how a single mistake can prove costly. Misjudging the line of the final shot in the fourth end, Kelley Law’s stone pushed a British stone into the ring and caused the surrender of two shots to Great Britain.
Although Canada levelled the score later in the match the advantage of last shot in the final end was invaluable and Britain scored an unexpected victory.
The final was also a tight affair, the Swiss scored first but Britain fought back to lead 3-1 after seven ends. Luzia Ebnöther’s Bern club rink equalled the score at 3-3 which left the tenth and final end to be decisive. The championship came down to the final stone and British skip Rhona Martin played it to perfection. The stone caught a Swiss stone at an angle to deflect it into the middle of the ring to gain the championship winning score.
The unexpected success of the British team was a minor sensation in their homeland, TV schedules were swiftly rearranged to allow live coverage of the final and an audience of seven million stayed up until past midnight to watch their victory in a sport where the pre-Games record TV audience was less than 200,000.
One of the Russian team, Nkeiruka Yezekh, became the first curler of African ancestry to compete at the Olympics. Whilst her mother was Russian, her father was originally from Nigeria.

Running with her for most of the race were two well-considered runners, Australia’s Lisa Martin and the GDR’s Katrin Dörre.

Although defending champion Lyudmila Titova was still around, and had won the 500 and 1,000 at the 1971 and 1972 European Championships, she had been surpassed as a short sprinter by Henning. Henning had set the three most recent world records, two in 1971 in Inzell, and most recently, recording 42.5 at Davos in January 1972.  At the 1971 World Sprints she had won both 500s and won the 500 distance at the 1971 World Championships. Titova started in the fourth pair and posted 44.45 to take the lead. Henning was in the next pair with Canada’s Sylvia Burka. Henning got off very quickly and was even with Burka at the changeover.

She went to the Games slightly ahead of Elana Meyers Taylor of the USA, and Germany’s Mariama Jamanka at the top of the world rankings.
Not only was Humphries’ Olympic pedigree in her favour, but she came into the Games having won the 2017-18 World Cup by just 40 points from Meyers Taylor. Humphries had also been runner-up in the 2016 and 2017 World Championships, but now had a new partner, Phylicia George, an Olympic hurdler in 2012 and 2016. Humphries’ former Olympic partner, Heather Moyse, was also looking for a third consecutive gold, and was acting as brakewoman for Alysia Rissling in Korea. Despite being favourite, Humphries faced steep opposition from the German crews, led respectively by Jamanka and Stephanie Schneider, and the USA sleds, piloted by Meyers Taylor and Jamie Greubel Poser. The Americans finished first and third at the 2017 World Championships and were second and third at the Sochi Olympics.
After the Jamaican 4-man team had made history at the 1988 Calgary Games, the Jamaican women emulated them by competing for the first time at PyeongChang, and were not just going along for the ride, particularly after a seventh-place finish in the Winterberg round of the 2017-18 World Cup. Just two days before the start of official training, however, the Jamaican team’s appearance was in jeopardy after their German-born driving coach and Olympic gold medalist Sandra Kiriasis, quit her post, and with it took the team’s sled, which she maintained was acquired by her on the team’s behalf, and she was legally responsible for it. The dispute was resolved at the last minute, however, when the top Jamaican beer company Red Stripe purchased the sled and donated it to the team. Not put off by the internal squabbling, the Jamaican pair of Jazmine Fenlator-Victorian and Carrie Russell finished ninth on the second official training run. They named their sled “Mr. Cool Bolt” in honour of the country’s leading sprinter Usain Bolt.
Also making history in the women’s event was the Nigerian team, who became the first African Olympic bobsleigh team, male or female. THe pilot was Seun Adigun who, like her other two squad members, Ngozi Onwumere and Akuoma Omeoga, studied in the United States and all were top class sprinters, with Adigun competing at the London 2012 Olympics. Onwumere won a gold and silver medal at the 2015 African Games.
The Americans Meyers Taylor and Lauren Gibbs were in blistering form on the first run, setting new start and track records. Their 50.52 seconds, however, was just 2/100ths faster than the German pair of Jamanka and Lisa Buckwitz. Jamie Greubel Poser, who posted some quick times in official training, finished third on 50.59 with one of the pre-race favourites Kaillie Humphries, in fifth place, 0.20s behind the leaders.
Despite setting another new start record on the second run, Meyers Taylor had to forfeit the lead as she swapped places with Jamanka, who turned her 0.02s deficit into a 0.07s lead after a 50.72 run. Greubel Poser and Stephanie Schneider also swapped places with the German, moving into third place. Despite setting the heat’s third fastest time, Kaillie Humphries remained in fifth place, with the British pair Mica McNeill and Mica Moore occupying sixth place for the second successive run, which came on the back of their last two official training runs when they finished second and joint second.
Meyers Taylor, and the former discus and hammer thrower Jamanka, continued to dominate in heat three. The German was first to go and set a new track record with a 50.49 but, next to go, was Meyers Taylor and she too, once again, set another track record and equaled her own start record, as she pulled back 3/100ths on Jamanka to trail by 4/100ths going into the final round. Two-time Olympic champion Kaillie Humphries put in her best run and equaled the old track record, as her 50.42 pulled her into the bronze medal position, while Stephanie Schneider dropped from third to fifth. Jamie Greubel Poser, winner of the PyeongChang World Cup race in 2017, stayed in fourth place 0.4s behind the leader.
Unlike the 2-man competition, which reduced the field after heat three, all 20 women’s pairs went in the fourth and final heat. Nigeria were the first to go, and they had the satisfaction of completing all four runs without mishap, as did the pioneering Jamaicans, who recorded the 13th fastest time in heat four. One of the most satisfying runs, however, must have been that of the British pair of McNeill and Moore, who finished in eighth place. Funding for the British pair was dropped in September 2017 and, in order to compete in PyeongChang, they raised around £50,000 from crowd funding. By finishing in the top 10 in Korea, however, they were assured of funding in the future.
It was clear after the first three heats that the gold medal would be going to either Jamanka or Meyers Taylor, but the battle for bronze was still very much on the cards, particularly after Stephanie Schneider set the fastest run of the heat at 50.70 and put herself into contention. That changed when Humphries posted a 50.77 to guarantee bronze, or maybe better if Jamanka or Meyers Taylor were to slip up.
Meyers Taylor laid down the marker after a run of 50.73 and this left the German needing 50.76 or better to take gold, which she did in style, by equaling Schneider’s fastest run, and win the gold medal by 7/100ths from the American who, yet again, failed to win the one major gold medal to have eluded her. Having won silver at Sochi in 2014 and bronze at Vancouver in 2010, it was now a second silver in PyeongChang. It was the second time Germany had won the 2-woman title, the last time being at Turin in 2006, when the recently departed Jamaican coach Sandra Kiriasis and Anja Schneiderheinze won the gold medal.

The United States and the Unified Team advanced to the semi-finals from Group A, while Spain and Italy advanced from Group B. In the semis, Italy defeated the Unified Team 9-8, while Spain defeated the United States 6-4. Italy and Spain had already met in pool play, tying 9-9.
The final became the longest water polo match in Olympic history. It was tied at the end of regulation, 7-7, and remained that way through two overtime periods. In the second overtime, Spanish superstar, Manuel Estiarte scored on a penalty throw with only 42 seconds remaining, appearing to give Spain the gold medal. But with 33 seconds to go, Jordi Sans was sent off and Italy’s Massimiliano Ferretti scored the equalizer. Three more overtimes were played, with no score. In the sixth overtime, Italy’s Fernando Gandolfi scored with 32 seconds on the clock, to put Italy ahead, 9-8. A last second Spanish shot failed and Italy won the gold medal.
As in 1980, 1984, and 1988, Manuel Estiarte was the leading scorer in the Olympic tournament, with 22 goals in Barcelona, but this time he was tied by Hungary’s Tibor Benedek.

Only 12 boats were provided by the organising committee so competition on the Buiten-Y lake so the 20 entrants were split into two qualifying groups for the early part of the event before ten finalists sailed the remaining four races. With the title decided on the majority ordinals system, the four wins obtained by Sweden’s Sven Thorell gave him the gold medal with one race still to come. Henrik Robert of Norway repeated his feat of four years earlier by winning the silver medal with Bertel Broman of Finland rounding off an all Scandinavian 1-2-3.
Scoring was by a point-for-place scoring system in round one and using majority ordinals (placements) in the final round, with final standings apparently decided by majority ordinals. This led to Léon Huybrechts (BEL), who did not qualify for the final, ranking ahead of two boats that did compete in the final. However, despite looking at several different options of the scoring, the final standings in the 1928 Official Report do not fully match either scoring system.

But the favorite in 1980 was Brazil’s João Carlos de Oliveira, world record holder and twice Pan American champion. Two other contenders were Keith Connor (GBR) and Ian Campbell (AUS) – who had been 1-2 at the 1978 Commonwealth Games. The 1980 Olympics were held in Moskva, and unfortunately, the officiating was not what it should have been. Round three produced much of the drama. Jaak Uudmäe (URS/EST) jumped 17.35 (56-11¼), with de Oliveira getting 17.22 (56-6) and Saneyev at 17.04 (55-11) – all three producing their leading marks to that point. But just before Uudmäe’s jump, Campbell had landed in the sand beyong the Olympic record marker (17.39 (57-0¾)), but the jump was ruled a foul that had not broken the plasticine. Pleading his case, the official told him he had dragged his foot on the step phase, which is almost impossible at that speed, and which nobody had seen. The sand was raked and the mark did not count, though observers thought it was around 17.50 (57-7). In fact, all of Campbell’s remaining marks were ruled fouls.
João de Oliveira also would not produce another fair jump, though observers also could not see anything wrong with his efforts, and two of his “fouls” were on very long jumps. Both times he walked away from the board, after examining it, shaking his head in frustration. The spurious officiating brought Saneyev a chance in the last round to win his fourth gold medal. He improved to 17.24 (56-6¾) to surpass de Oliveira but had to settle for silver. It was difficult for de Oliveira. But in December 1991 he was struck head-on by a drunken driver and after a nine-month battle, would lose his right leg, having it amputated below the knee. He died quite early from liver and lung disease, complications of the alcoholism which had consumed him.

Though the Chinese riders were eliminated before the final, all the other favourites were all present.
Vogel took out the lead in the final but she faltered in the final stages, leaving Ligtlee to hold off the fast charging Becky James of Great Britain for the win. Ligtlee had only just qualified for the final after a fall by a Colombian rider had opened up space after she appeared trapped behind her opponents. Second placed James had appeared to be the next star in the sport back in 2013, when she won World Championship medals in four events, but major knee and shoulder injuries and a cancer scare had left her off the track for the best part of three years.

But South Korea was not to be forgotten, having won the Olympic gold four times in a row since 1994. Finally, the home nation was also strong, having medalled at all four World Championships since the Torino Olympics.
The three favored nations easily made it to the final - both South Korea and China broke the Olympic Record - where they were joined by the United States. The deciding moment of the race was just after an exchange, with Korea’s Kim Min-Jeong and China’s Sun Linlin fighting to take the lead. In the process, Kim slightly bumped into Sun, who was able to continue only after a slight stumble. The Koreans then pulled away to win in a world record time. But as the Koreans were picking up flags, it slowly became clear that the jury was investigating the maneuver by Kim. After a few minutes it was announced that South Korea had indeed been disqualified, giving the gold to China, silver to Canada and bronze to the United States, which had nearly been lapped during the race. Naturally, this led to protests from the Korean camp, especially since the referee making the call, Jim Hewish of Australia, had been the same to controversially disqualify Kim Dong-Seong in the 2002 Winter Olympics.

All teams losing to the gold medallist played each other for second place, and all teams losing to the silver medallist place for third place.",na,"The 1920 Olympic Games began with ice hockey games, commencing with the Sweden-Belgium game on 23 April. There was no opening ceremony of the Olympics held prior to the game - that was to come later. This was the first time ice hockey was conducted at the Olympic Games and it has been held continuously since; however, at the Olympic Winter Games only.
This was also the only time that Olympic ice hockey was contested by seven-man teams. The seventh position was that of rover, in addition to three forwards, two defensemen, and the goalie. The tournament was conducted indoors at Le Palais de Glace d’Anvers, situated at the Rue de la Santé, near the Botanic Gardens in Antwerp. The rink measured only 18×56 metres (59 by 185 feet), which was quite narrow by Canadian standards and was made to appear even smaller by the 14 skaters on the ice. Finally, the games consisted of two 20-minute halves, unlike the Canadian game of three 20-minute periods.
Canada, where ice hockey is the national game, was the class of the tournament, being challenged only by the United States team. The Winnipeg Falcons, who had won the 1920 Allan Cup, symbolic of amateur hockey supremacy in Canada, represented Canada. The Falcons were formed as a team in 1908, joining two previous teams, the Viking and Athletic Clubs of Winnipeg. They disbanded after one year, but reorganized in 1912. Although the team suspended play during the war, the Falcons resumed competition in 1919, winning the championship of Western Canada. They won the Allan Cup in 1920 by defeating the University of Toronto Varsities, 8-3 and 3-2. Of the eight “Canadian” players, seven were actually of Icelandic origin. Only goalie Wally Byron was not. The team nickname, Falcons, was chosen because the Falcon is a symbol of Iceland.
The United States was represented by 11 players who were members of three clubs – the St. Paul Athletic Club, the Pittsburgh Athletic Association, and the Boston Athletic Association. At least four members of the American team were born and raised in Canada – the brothers Joe and Larry McCormick, Frank Synnott, and Herbert Drury. They had been playing for American clubs for some time and, although they were all Canadian citizens, it is not known if they had also attained American citizenship by 1920. It mattered little for Olympic eligibility rules were much more lax in that era. In a training match on 23 March, the U.S. team played the Winnipeg Falcons, losing 3-2 to the Canadians.
In the first game, Sweden against Belgium, it was noted by one sportswriter that “the Swedes were rough even by Canadian standards.” The next day, Canada and the U.S. made their débuts, winning easily. In the Canadian 15-0 victory over Czechoslovakia, Czechoslovakia did not get a single shot on goal.
In the semi-finals, Sweden defeated France 4-0. The big match was the other semi-final between the United States and Canada. The referee was to be Garon, a Canadian who was an officer with the American Red Cross. The Canadians demanded the right to replace him if his work was unsatisfactory and he refused to referee under that condition, being replaced by M. Catella, a Frenchman. The game was scoreless at halftime, but Canada scored two second-half goals to win 2-0. In the finals, Canada defeated Sweden quite easily, 12-1.
Second- and third-place were decided by the Bergvall System (termed the Vancouver System in Canada) in which all teams losing to the champion, Canada, played off in a single-elimination tournament to decide the runner-up. When that was finished, all teams that had lost to either the first or second-place team then contested another single-elimination tournament for third place. The United States easily defeated Czechoslovakia, 16-0, for second place, while Czechoslovakia nipped Sweden 1-0, to earn the bronze medal. Sweden was decidedly hampered by the draw of the Bergvall system, being forced to play games on five consecutive days.

They remained like that through 13 laps when Ayana decided to start her time trial, running the next lap in 66.5. Only Vivian Cheruiyot was anywhere near her at the end of the lap.
Ayana continued, running metronomic laps to the finish, shattering the world record by running 29:17.45. The previous official world record was 29:31.78 by China’s Wang Junxia but that mark was considered almost certainly performance-aided, and most track stat freaks felt the true world best was the 29:53.80 set by Meselech Melkamu in 2009. Thus, Ayana’s time was over 36 seconds faster than that mark. She ran the second 5K in 14:30.4, her last 3,000 in 8:47.5, and the final four laps in 4:41.5.
Behind Ayana, the top 13 runners were pulled to PRs and there were multiple national records set.

However, she had decided to become a mother, and her only appearance in the skating world in 2002 was to open a new indoor rink in Erfurt that was named for her. This left the burden of being the favorite to her compatriots, Claudia Pechstein and Anni Friesinger. Pechstein was the world record holder since March 2001, having been the first woman to beat 4 minutes in the event. She had also been the World Champion back in 2000. But in the Olympic season, she had yet to win, having been beaten by Friesinger in all the World Cup races and at the European Championships.
Friesinger, who had hoped to compete for three golds in Salt Lake, was the first competitor to beat 4 minutes, but only narrowly, and with slow laps towards the end. This gave room for Pechstein, generally able to keep her lap times stable. She did just that in her race, trailing Friesinger until 2,200 m, then winning seconds in the final two laps. Finishing in a new world record time of 3:57.70, she dragged along pair mate Cindy Klassen, who had just missed the 1998 Olympics as a member of the Canadian ice hockey squad. But Pechstein’s title was not yet secured. In the last pair, her splits were copied by Renate Groenewold. She kept up the pace until 2,200 m, then had to let go, finishing just ahead of Klassen for an unexpected silver medal. Even less expected was that she pushed Friesinger off the podium, leaving fourth place for the favorite.

The Grand Prix was effectively the qualifying round that doubled as the team competition, with the top 25 riders advancing to the Grand Prix Special. The top 14 riders after two rounds then advanced to the Grand Prix Freestyle, which was dressage set to music, termed kür. The final placements for the top 14 riders were determined by total score for all three rounds. Scoring was also different. Previously the points for each judge were added together for the total score. Now, each round was scored that way, but a percentage score of the maximum was also given, and used for the totals, so the highest total score was theoretically 300, for 100% in each round. The new format and scoring was revolutionary and changed dressage from a very boring competition into just a sorta boring one.
The event was now dominated by women as they took the top five places.

When she won in 2013, she was the youngest ever rhythmic gymnastics world champion. With two-time Olympic gold medallist Yevgeniya Kanayeva now retired, the way was open for Kudryavtseva to add to her successes, but not without stiff opposition from her team-mate Margarita Mamun, who was the 2014 and 2015 World Championship runner-up.
Any chance to spoil the Russian domination came from Ukraine, Bulgaria and Belarus, who had the impressive pair of Melitina Stanyuta and Katsiaryna Halkina in their squad. Son Yeon-Jae was hoping to become the first Korean to win a rhythmic medal. Fifth in London in 2012 and ranked number five in the world going into the Rio Games, Son is a celebrity in her home-country having appeared in TV drama shows.
In one of the few sports in which the United States has never won a medal, there remained optimism that would be overturned in Rio in the shape of 16-year-old high school student Laura Zeng, who earned her trip after winning her second straight national title shortly before the Games. She had impressively won all five disciplines at the 2015 Pan American Games and in May 2016 became the first American to win a medal at a World Cup event, winning the hoop and ribbon at the Minsk event.
To prove that age is no barrier in a sport dominated by younger women, Spain’s Carolina Rodríguez was 30 when the 2016 Games started. An Olympian with the Spanish group in 2004 and 2012, she nearly gave up the sport but decided to concentrate on the individual event and qualified for Rio via the 2015 World Championships after finishing ninth in the all-round competition.
Sadly for Laura Zeng she didn’t make it beyond the qualifying competition, by a mere 0.141 of a point in 11th place. Nevertheless, it was the highest ever placing by an American since rhythmic gymnastics was introduced at the 1984 Games. As expected, the list of qualifiers was headed by the Russians with Mamun ranking one in hoop, ball and ribbon for a combined score of 74.383 while Kudryavtseva ranked first with the clubs and was second with 73.998. The biggest challenge to the Russians came from Ukranian Hanna Rizatdinova who ranked second in clubs, hoop and ribbon, and third with the ball and was just 0.066 of a point behind in third place.
In the final, Margarita Mamun outscored Kudryavtseva to win the fifth consecutive gold medal for Russia, and for the third time after 2004 and 2012 they have won both gold and silver. This is one of three events at which Russia has won five consecutive gold medals, after the duets and team synchronised swimming. Mamum posted the top score on the clubs, and second best on hoop, ribbon and ball and when Kudryavtseva failed to catch one of her clubs it opened the door for Mamun who eventually won 76.483 to 75.608 with Rizatdinova on 73,582 points in third place.

Neither Selkov or López-Zubero arrived at Atlanta with the fastest time of the year so far – that honour belonged to the Italian Emanuele Merisi who had swam a fast 1:57.70 at the Italian Olympic trails. However none of the three could perform up to expectations at the Olympic Games and Selkov failed even to reach the final. The men who did produce their best on the important day were two Americans who were both from Florida and who had competed against each other since they were very young.

56624,"1,500 metres, Men",1912 Summer Olympics,6,Athletics,/editions/6/sports/ATH,9 – 10 July 1912,"Stockholms Olympiastadion, Stockholm",45 from 14 countries,na,na,"As late as 1985, Cordner Nelson and Roberto Quercetani, two distinguished track & field historians, labeled this “the greatest race ever run,” noting, “The 1912 Olympic Games at Stockholm produced the greatest mile or 1500 meter race ever run from the standpoint of exciting competition between fast runners.”  Much of what follows is based on their excellent summary.
There were five highly considered runners who started this event at Stockholm.  One was the defending Olympic champion, Mel Sheppard.  He was primarily a half-miler, and only the day before this event started, he lost narrowly in the 800 metre semi-final.
There were three other top Americans.  John Paul Jones had won the 1911 and 1912 IC4A title at 880 yards and one mile.  On 27 May 1911, Jones set a world amateur record in the mile with 4:15.4 in winning the IC4A at Cambridge.  After the 1912 IC4A meet, he stopped training, not planning on competing at the Olympics, but he was convinced to resume training and travel to Stockholm.
Norm Taber of Brown University had done little prior to 1912.  But on 1 June he finished in a dead-heat with Jones in the IC4A mile.  And at the eastern Olympic Trial, one week later, he ran 1,500 metres in 3:56.4, bettering the world record, but he finished only second in the race.
Taber finished second in the eastern Olympic Trial because of a highly talented, diminutive runner named Abel Kiviat.  Kiviat had first achieved prominence in 1909, winning the Canadian mile championship.  In 1911 he won the AAU mile championship.  On 26 May 1912, Kiviat ran in the New York Post Office Clerk’s Association Games at Celtic Park on Long Island, winning the mile narrowly over Mel Sheppard, but setting a new 1,500 metre world record of 3:59.2 in doing so.  In a handicap race at the same track on 2 June, he bettered that mark off scratch, recording 3:56.8.  The record would be short-lived, as on 8 June, at the eastern Olympic Trial, he defeated Taber with another world record of 3:55.8.  His hot running and three world records in only a few weeks made him the Olympic favorite.
Despite the four great American runners, Britain had a top talent in Arnold  Jackson, but one who had little background as a miler.  A well-rounded athlete who attended Brasenose College, Oxford, in 1912 he won the Oxford University Athletic Club mile and won the mile against Cambridge in a good time of 4:21.6.  Based on those performances, he was named to the British Olympic team for Stockholm.
There were seven heats in round one, with the top two finishers in each heat advancing to the final.  The five favorites qualified easily, although Jackson and Jones had been drawn in the same heat.  The final consisted of 14 runners - seven Americans, three Swedes, two Brits, and a lone Frenchman and German.  The four top Americans would be well protected by their group of seven teammates.
The “greatest race ever run” began at 3:30 PM (1530) on Wednesday, 10 July 1912.  The pace was set by the Frenchman, Henri Arnaud, who passed 400 metres in 1:05 and 800 metres in 2:08.  Taber led at 1,000 metres in 2:39, but at 1,200 metres, Kiviat took the lead in 3:09, closely followed by his teammates, Taber and Jones.  Jackson had been running last most of the race, but passed Sheppard on the backstretch and began moving up the field.  On the final curve, Kiviat continued to lead, followed by Taber, Jackson, Jones, and Sheppard.  Taber pulled even with Kiviat at the start of the straightaway.  With 50 metres remaining, Jackson pulled even with Kiviat and Taber, with Jones close behind and Sweden’s Ernst Wide closing fast as well.  It was only 10 metres from the tape that Jackson edged ahead to win by 1/10th second from Kiviat (silver medal) and Taber (bronze medal).  Kiviat and Taber were so close that the finish camera was needed to determine the final medal placements, the only time this was used to determine a placement at the 1912 Olympics.  Jones finished fourth with Wide in fifth.
Jackson described the race in his own words, “Perhaps it is impossible in an Olympic mile to notice who got the lead, when and where, and Kiviat seemed to me to have the lead inside most of the way and Mr P. J. Baker and I had to get along the best way we could and not very near the front either.  There we rubbed along until the bell went for the last lap.  We then moved up and dropped Sheppard and several others who no doubt were rather tired after the general bustle and their previous efforts.  With three hundred and fifty yards to go Paul Jones and Kiviat were well placed but coming round the last bend I got in behind them and running wide caught them with about a hundred yards to go.  Running neck and neck for fifty yards I passed them and got home by about two yards, as far as I am told.  A perfect day and capital fellow competitors helped the Olympic record to go and I am very grateful and proud to have run with Mr Kiviat, Taber, and Jones and all the others.  I believe that the result of the second and third places was not given out until the photograph had been developed and Mr Kiviat just beat Mr Taber on the post with Mr Jones right on to them. ‘U.S.A. right there all the time!’”
Arnold Nugent Strode Jackson (who later changed his name spelling to Arnold Nugent Strode Strode-Jackson) ran only a few more races in a very short, yet meteoric career.  He won the Oxbridge mile race again in 1913 and 1914, and his career totalled no more than six top quality races.  He joined the British army in World War I, serving with distinction, and becoming the youngest Brigadier-General in the British Army.  He won the DSO and three bars, decorations so matched by only six other British officers.  He was later a British delegate to the Paris Peace Conference in 1921, and was awarded the CBE for his works.  He settled in the United States, eventually becoming an American citizen.

Pearce’s position was only strengthened when Germany’s Herbert Buhtz, the winner of the 1932 Diamond Sculls, fell ill and was unable to compete (he did, however, win a silver medal in the double sculls, alongside Gerhard Boetzelen). In both the opening round and the final, the only rower who was able to challenge him was Bill Miller of the United States, a silver medalist in the coxed fours from the 1928 Games. Miller was able to hold his own in both races and trounced his opponents in the repêchage. Pearce was simply the superior sculler, however, and successfully defended his crown with a time of 7:44.4. Miller, less than a second behind, took silver while Guillermo Douglas of Uruguay, despite finishing over 28 seconds after Miller, came in third and won his nation’s first individual Olympic medal  (the country had won the 1924 and 1928 football tournaments). Pearce turned professional in 1933 and became World Champion, a distinction that he defended in 1934 and 1938. Douglas, Uruguay’s first rowing representative at the Olympics, returned home to a hero’s welcome.

Ties broken by lightest bodyweight.,na,"The second day of the Olympic weightlifting competition saw the second men’s event contested. It was the first time since 1992 that two weight classes had been held on the same day. This weight class was for lifters up to 67 kg, almost equal to the 67.5 kg of the historical lightweight class contested between 1920 and 1992. In the field of 14 lifters was Chen Lijun, season best 333 kg, a four-time world champion 2013 and 2015 (62 kg) and 2018-19 (67 kg). He was also the Asian Championships winner in 2019 and 2020 (held in April 2021). At the 2019 Asian Championships he also set world records in snatch (154 kg), clean & jerk (185 kg), and the still-standing record in total (339 kg). The snatch world record was bettered by Huang Minhao (CHN), season best 332 kg, with 155 kg at the Olympics Test Event in Tokyo later in 2019, and the clean & jerk world record, which Chen improved to 187 kg, was bettered by Pak Jong-Ju with 188 kg at the 2019 World Championships, but both Huang and Pak did not compete at the Tokyo Games. Huang missed the Games because every nation could only nominate one athlete per weight class, and Pak was not present because PRK did not send a team due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The remaining challengers to Chen were Luis Javier Mosquera, season best 330 kg, bronze medallist from Rio (69 kg) and 2020 Pan American champion (held in 2021), Muhammed Furkan Özbek, season best 323 kg, gold medallist at the 2021 European Championships and 2021 Junior World Championships, Mirko Zanni, qualification best 320 kg, runner-up at the 2021 European Championships, and Adkhamjon Ergashev, qualification best 328 kg, 2019 Junior World champion, bronze medallist at the last Asian Championships, and second best qualifier for the Tokyo Games in the ranking list on points.
Chen and Zanni both lifted 145 kg in their first snatch attempts, but both were not able to improve in their next two attempts as both failed to lift weights of 150- and 151 kg, respectively. This opened up the competition for others with Mosquera having already lifted 148 kg in his first snatch. Han Myeong-Mok and Talha Talib, who only got a place on the Tripartite Commission Invitation a few weeks before the Games, both lifted 147 kg in their second attempts. When Mosquera cleared 151 kg and Talib, known as a good snatcher, did the same with 150 kg in their last attempts, they finished first and second after the snatch followed by Han (147 kg), Chen, and Zanni (both 145 kg). The first of the medal contenders to finish his clean & jerk was Talib who lifted 170 kg in his last attempt for a total of 320 kg. He had already caused some drama after collapsing on the stage shortly after missing his first attempt over 166 kg due to short of breath. He soon recovered after medical staff supported him and he went on for another two lifts, and both were successful over 166 kg and 170 kg. Zanni failed to lift 172 kg in his first attempt and Han failed 174 kg in his second. When Han lifted 174 kg in his last attempt for a total of 321 kg, Zanni had to go for 177 kg to overtake the Korean. The Italian failed in his second attempt, but managed to clear 177 kg in his last attempt for a total of 322 kg, winning bronze with only two good lifts in this competition. In between, both Mosquera and Chen lifted 175 kg, which secured the former at least a silver medal. After a missed attempt at 180 kg, it looked as though Mosquera cleared this weight with his last lift, but the attempt was given invalid as he dropped the bar before the siren. This was reviewed by the jury and finally it was given as a good lift as he always had control over the weight. This gave him a total of 331 kg, putting pressure on Chen, who now had to go for 187 kg, 12 kg more as in his first attempt and only one kilogram short of the world record, to win gold. Still competing was Ergashev, who tried to lift 184 kg, which would have been good enough to win bronze, but he failed twice. So, the last athlete to perform was Chen, down in fourth place and out of the medals, he had two more attempts to lift 187 kg. He needed only one as he was successful in his first attempt, totaling 332 kg. After being down 6 kg after the snatch, he won gold by 1 kg.
The Olympic Standard for Olympic records was 151 kg for snatch, 181 kg for clean & jerk, and 328 kg for total. The best snatch in this competition was by Mosquera with 151 kg, but as the standard had to be improved by at least 1 kg this did not count as Olympic record. In clean & jerk, Chen set an Olympic record with 187 kg, and in total, first Mosquera set the Olympic record with 331 kg, only to be bettered by Chen with 332 kg.
This was the third weightlifting gold medal for China at the Games, so China was still unbeaten. Winning two weightlifting gold medals on the same day made China the first nation to do so since 1960 when Viktor Bushuyev and Aleksandr Kurynov both won gold for the Soviet Union on the same day. If counting the 69 kg class as precursor of this weight class, China has won the last five gold medals in this event. Silver was the second medal for Mosquera, but the first time he stood on the podium as his bronze medal in 2016 only came after being upgraded following a doping case. The bronze medal of Zanni for Italy, who already won the first weightlifting medal for Italy at the Youth Olympics with bronze in 2014, was the first weightlifting medal for that nation since Norberto Oberburger won gold back in 1984. Talib, the first Olympic weightlifter competing for Pakistan since 1976, placed fifth to give his country the best ever weightlifting result in history. Their last Olympic medal in any sport was back to 1992, when the men’s hockey team took home bronze.

Bouts were for one touch and a double touch counted as a defeat for both fencers.  If there was a tie in the number of victories and the number of fencers who were tied was greater than the number who could qualify, the tie was resolved by using the results of the tied fencers in their bouts with each other as if another pool had been fenced.  For example, in Pool One, Antonidas and Blake were tied with 4 victories for fifth place in the pool but only five qualified.  Antonidas had beaten Blake in the pool and so he was the one who was promoted.
The épée events were somewhat weak competitions, as the best épée fencers in the world were the French and the Italians. As noted above, the French boycotted the entire Olympic fencing competition. And the Italians refused to compete in the épée, upset with the rules. The Italian Fencing Federation had proposed that the blade of the épée be lengthened to 94 cm., and when this proposal was rejected, they refused to participate in the épée events.
With the French and Italians absent, the Belgians did well, advancing four fencers to the final.  Paul Anspach of Belgium won the gold medal.  Anspach competed as a fencer at the Olympics of 1908, 1912, 1920, and 1924, winning five Olympic medals as follows: 1908 épée team bronze; 1912 épée individual gold; 1912 épée team gold; 1920 épée team silver; and 1924 épée team silver.

He was the world record holder, had won the 2011 World Championships, and had been world-ranked #1 in the event in 2009-11. He had not aimed for a world record in London, but simply wanted to set a fast pace to make it as difficult as possible for the other runners. Rudisha took the lead in the final from the break, passing 200 metres in 23.5 and the 400 in 49.28. Sudanese rival Abubaker Kaki was close, trailing at the bell in 49.4, as was Mohammed Aman (ETH) in 49.5 and Nijel Amos (BOT) in 49.7. Rudisha did not slow down, running 25.02 for the third 200 to pass 600 in 1:14.30, ahead of his paces in his two world record efforts. Kaki was destroyed by his attempt to stay close, as he would drop back to seventh. But Rudisha kept after it, crossing the line in 1:40.91, another world record, and the first 800 ever run under 1:41.
Rudisha towed the other runners to the greatest 800 metre race in history, based on times. Every finalist except Kaki set a PR, and places 2-8 all set best-for-place records. The silver went to Amos in 1:41.73, making him the third fastest ever over two laps, with Rudisha’s teammate Timothy Kitum coming home for bronze in 1:42.53, a mark better than the previous Olympic record of 1:42.58 set in 1996 by Norwegian Vebjørn Rodal. Amos had recently won the 2012 World Junior title, but Kitum was even younger at only 17-years-old and became the youngest ever medalist in the Olympic 800. Amos’ medal was the first ever for Botswana.
Rudisha said later that he thought of his father, Daniel, at the starting line. Daniel Rudisha had anchored Kenya to a silver in the 4×400 at the 1968 Olympics, and Rudisha noted, “He has always been my role model.” London Organizing Committee chairman Sebastian Coe, himself twice a world-record setter in the 800, noted, “It was the most extraordinary piece of running I have probably ever seen. It was the performance of the Games, not just of track & field, but of the Games. Rudisha’s run will go down in history as one of the greatest Olympic victories.”

Poland recovered to beat Italy and Japan and then won a close fought semi-final victory against the Hungarians. The other semi-final was a meeting of the two most recent World Champion teams which saw the USSR earn the right to face Poland via a 9-6 over France.

After a decade of major title frustration Woyda had now won his second Olympic title in three days.

Randori means “chaos taking” or “grasping freedom,” and is contrasted to the more structured practice of kata. Aikido was developed by Morihei Ueshiba to synthesize martial arts, philosophy, and religious beliefs. Aikido may be translated as “the Way of unifying (with) life energy” or as “the Way of harmonious spirit.” Sixteen (16) different shiai events were demonstrated at Tokyo in 1964 as part of the kendo demonstrations. This event consisted of two seniors demonstrating shiai.

He was the 1956 silver medalist, and had won most of the major meets at the distance since 1958, including the 1958 and 1959 World and European Championships. But he had recently struggled a bit, placing only seventh all-around and seventh at the distance at the recent 1960 World Championships, and although he had won the 1960 Europeans, his third consecutive all-around title at the meet, he had placed only third in the 10,000, won by Sweden’s Ivar Nilsson. The recent 5,000 gold medalist, Viktor Kosichkin, was also considered a challenger. The world record in the event was the vaunted 16:32.6, set by Hjalmar Andersen at Hamar, long ago in 1952, although it was tenuous. In 1959 it had been bettered at Chelyabinsk by Nikolajs Sjtelbaums with 16:31.4, and in January 1960 by both Sjtelbaums and Vladimir Shilykovsky at Medeo, but neither record was ratified by the ISU.
Unlike the men’s 1,500 and 5,000, the day of the 10,000 dawned with perfect weather, clear skies and no wind. In the second pair, Sweden’s Kjell Bäckman broke Andersen’s world record easily, finishing in 16:14.2. But it would eventually bring him only a bronze medal. Johannesen was up two pairs later. He set a fast pace, and was 10 seconds ahead of Bäckman at 5,600 metres. It seemed too fast, but it was not, and he would continue at that speed to the end, crossing almost 28 seconds ahead of Bäckman, and a full 46 seconds ahead of Andersen’s world record, in 15:46.6, the first 10K ever under 16 minutes. Kosichkin was in the sixth pair. Remarkably, he went out even faster than Johannesen and was ahead through 6,400 m, and they were tied at 7,600 metres, but the pace then wore on him. He finished in 15:49.2. A tremendous time, 44+ seconds better than the world record, it would bring him only a silver medal.
Johannesen’s 10K in Squaw Valley is considered one of the legendary performances in speed skating history, though the perfect weather, clear ice, and high altitude certainly contributed. Some speed skating experts thought the record would never be broken, but it lasted only until 1963. Johannesen would return in 1964 to complete his medal set in the event, winning a bronze. He was all-around World Champion in 1957 and 1964.

The only other returning Olympic medalist was Israel’s Michael Kolganov, but his last major international medal in this discipline had come at the 1998 World Championships.

The most recent World Champions, however, were the West Germans, who sent the victorious crew, Albert Hedderich, Raimund Hörmann, Dieter Wiedenmann, and Michael Dürsch, to Los Angeles as the heavy favorites. In both rounds of competition, however, the West Germans had to contend with a strong Australian delegation that consisted of Paul Reedy, Gary Gullock, Tim McLaren, and Tony Lovrich. The Australians won their heat in a time less than a second slower than the West Germans won theirs and, in the final, engaged their European opponents in a fantastic drive to the gold medal, which they lost by only 0.43 seconds. Australia thus settled for silver while Canada, represented by the squad that was fourth at the 1983 World Championships, Doug Hamilton, Mike Hughes, Phil Monckton, and Bruce Ford, took bronze.

By the start of the 2010 Games Ammann was in a rich vein of form and had already collected five World Cup victories in the season to date. His rivals for the top space on the Olympic podium included the veteran four-time world champion from Poland, Adam Małysz, the returning Janne Ahonen and any member of the powerful Austrian quartet.
Ammann, jumping last of the 51 competitors in the first round, flew out to the 105 metre mark in the opening round then waited in the drizzle as his rivals almost all improved their distances in the second round. With the final jump of the competition he floated away to set a new hill record at 108 metres and regain the title he had won in 2002. Behind him were Małysz in second and Austria’s Gregor Schlierenzauer in third. Janne Ahonen’s attempt to win a medal at his fifth Olympics was thwarted by a mere handful of points.

It was not the first race at this Games, as the first run of the women’s giant slalom had already been held, but the men’s downhill was held before the second run.
The downhill piste, named “Rock”, was again created by Bernhard Russi, this time assisted by Didier Défago, and Russi called the slope comparable to the Birds of Prey in Beaver Creek. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, there were no races on the piste before Beijing, as the World Cup events planned for February 2020 had to be cancelled. Therefore, the slope was brand new for all racers and only two training runs could be held as the third one was cancelled due to strong winds.
The downhill World Cup since the last Olympics in South Korea had been dominated by Beat Feuz, who had won all four downhill Crystal Globes since then (2018-2021). The last two World champions, however, were Kjetil Jansrud (2019 in Åre) and Vincent Kriechmayr (2021 in Cortina d’Ampezzo).
The ongoing World Cup of the current season saw eight downhills held with six different winners and only Aleksander Aamodt Kilde was able to win more than one race with wins in Beaver Creek, Wengen 1, and Kitzbühel 1. The other races were won by Matthias Mayer (Lake Louise), Bryce Bennett (Val Gardena), Dominik Paris (Bormio), Vincent Kriechmayr (Wengen 2), and Beat Feuz (Kitzbühel 2). The results put Kilde at the top of the standings, followed by Feuz, Mayer, and Odermatt (who finished second in three races).
Of the medallists from PyeongChang, the Norwegians Aksel Lund Svindal (gold) had retired in February 2019 and Kjetil Jansrud (silver) did not start after still recovering from an injury following a fall in early December 2021. This led to only Feuz (bronze) participating in the Beijing race. The first training run was won by Stefan Rogentin, but Kilde set the best time by winning the second training run with 1:43.72.
The race started with only 42 competitors, the fewest ever for this event, and was held in good conditions with the wind not being a factor on race day. Kriechmayr with bib number 1 set the early pace but was overtaken by his compatriot Mayer, with Kilde placing between them and the surprising Jack Crawford, only seven-hundredths of a second behind Mayer. Feuz started with bib number 13 and put in a great performance, and took the lead by 16/100ths. Paris and Odermatt were not able to get into a podium position and the last racer of the top group was French veteran Johan Clarey. He finished second, just 1/10th behind Feuz, knocking Crawford off the podium, who finally finished fourth.
Feuz won the race with an average speed of 110.50 km/h and 3.07 metres ahead of Clarey. The first four finishers all used Head skis while Kilde in fifth place raced Atomic. Clarey, already the second oldest male Olympic Alpine skier to participate in Beijing, became the oldest Alpine skiing medallist ever at 41-030.

He was pitted against Manfred Wolke of the GDR, with Wolke winning by majority decision, 4-1. Bessala was a Cameroonian hero and was given a car and a house for his efforts. David Wallechinsky in The Complete Book of the Olympics tells the story of the house, “ … Bessala returned to find his house occupied by a stranger – and realized that he had forgotten to ask for official papers for the house. Bessala was given a second house by the state, but was evicted without explanation several years later.” Bessala fought professionally from 1969-78, winning 14 fights, losing 2, with one draw. In 1978 he won the African Boxing Union welterweight title by decision over Bechir Boundka, but lost his next fight for that title to Mimoun Mohatar, and then retired. Wolke came back to box at the 1972 Olympics but lost in an early round and then became a coach.

The final round consisted of two rounds of jumping with both rounds to count towards the total score. Two riders went clear in both rounds of the final, German Ludger Beerbaum and the Netherlands’ Piet Raymakers. However, on his second ride, Raymakers was 0.66 seconds over the time limit, giving him 0.25 faults and dropping him to the silver medal, as Beerbaum won gold.

En-route to the final bout in the 86 kg class, Sadulayev had not given up one single point in the Olympic tournament, outscoring three early opponents 28-0.

Buchard, however, had clinched the European title, won the World Masters in 2021, and had already defeated Abe on the World Judo Tour. In the final, after 8:27 min, and well into the extra-time, the Japanese pinned Buchard with a Kuzure-kesa-gatame for an Ippon (full point) as Golden Score. Abe had a tough path into the final and beat the two eventual bronze medallists, Odette Giuffrida, Italy’s silver medallist in 2016, and Britain’s Chelsie Giles, the only highly seeded participant with no World or European Championships medal to her credit. Against Giuffrida, Abe required more than seven minutes for a Golden Score. Buchard sailed through the first three rounds with convincing victories by Ippon including a 16 seconds flash victory over Switzerland’s Fabienne Kocher.
Although dominant in the bout, Kocher later missed the first Judo medal for Switzerland in succumbing Giles, who scored two Waza-aris (half points) to take bronze. Giuffrida toppled Hungarian Reka Pupp by Seoi-nage for an Ippon after 4:31. In the first round, Pupp eliminated Majlinda Kelmendi from Kosovo, sending her home after just one match. Only seeded 15th, the 2016 gold medallist was not considered a potential medallist in Tokyo although she had placed third at the 2021 World Masters in Doha.
Abe won her gold medal about half an hour before her brother Hifume won gold in the same weight category in the men’s events. Thus, they accomplished the same historical feat as in the 2018 World Championships, when they clinched the titles as the first brother and sister to do so.

The reigning world champion  was 19 year old Qiu Bo of China who had posted some phenomenal scores over the last 18 months including a record breaking score of 609 at a meeting in Moscow. This was the first time a diver had scored over 600 points. The home favourite was Tom Daley, Bo’s predecessor as world champion, who was treated in the same way as a pop star in Britain whilst Matt Mitcham of Australia would return to defend his Olympic title.
There were some doubts about both Daley and Mitcham as both had faced personal difficulties before the Games. Daley had lost his father after a long battle with cancer in 2011 whilst Mitcham had struggled with the fame that his Olympic title had given him and confessed that at one point he had become addicted to crystal meth.
Through the qualifying rounds Bo appeared a class apart from his opposition and finished 30 points clear of anyone in both the preliminary and semi-finals. The final however would turn out to be a vastly different competition. For the first five dives Bo, Daley and American David Boudia  were almost inseparable on the leader board and with the only the final set of dives to go the Briton held a miniscule lead of 0.15 points over Bo and Boudia who were tied for second place. In truth there was little to choose between the three men’s execution of their dives. Daley’s dive may have been the cleanest of the three but it was of a lower difficulty than the other two dives so Boudia, whose dive was adjudged slightly superior to that of Bo, became Olympic champion by the slender margin of 1.8 points. Although Boudia was the silver medallist at the 2011 World Championship his victory was still considered a major surprise as few thought Bo could be beaten. Despite only qualifying in the 16th and last available position from the preliminary round, he was the first American to win an Olympic diving title since Mark Lenzi in 1992.

Frolov’s campaign was nearly ended by American Charley Ellis in the last eight but three of the five judges voted in his favour and he survived the scare. He then had the luxury of a walkover in the semi-final. Kulej’s path to the final included a victory over the 1956 Olympic champion Dick McTaggart. The final started as a cagey affair but Kulej came to dominate from centre ring and used his jab to keep the Russian off balance throughout.

In qualifying for the vault final she became the first Indian of either sex ever to qualify for an individual final since the qualification process of limiting the number of gymnasts on each piece of apparatus was introduced at Rome in 1960. Even if she finished eighth it would be the best ever finish by an Indian gymnast. She won the bronze medal at the 2014 Commonwealth Games and her performance was enhanced by her execution of the very difficult and dangerous Produnova vault. At the time of the Rio Olympics, Karmakar was one of only five gymnasts to have successfully completed this vault.
The Indian was not fancied for a gold medal, which looked certain to go to the new gymnastic sensation Simone Biles of the USA, who was winner of the all-round competition four days earlier. Strangely, Biles only came third on the horse vault at the 2015 World Championships and the two women who finished above her, Hong Un-jong of North Korea and Mariya Paseka of Russia, were likely to collect the other two medals in Rio. Paseka was the 2015 World Champion and bronze medallist in London 2012. Un-jong was the 2014 World Champion.
Un-jong set the mark, as she was the first to compete, with a score of 14.900, which was not likely to keep her in the lead for long. Remarkably after the next two gymnasts, Shallon Olsen of Canada and Oksana Chusovitina of Uzbekistan had completed their vaults, Un-jong was still in the lead but then Wang Yan of China topped her score with 14.999. Giulia Steingruber of Switzerland, who qualified as third best vaulter, became the new leader with 15.216. Then Karmakar went into second place after a Tsukahama gave her 14.866 points and then the Produnova and its difficulty rating of 7.00 gave her 15.266 for a score of 15.066. She was in the silver medal position with just two to go – but what a two; Paseka and Biles.
The Russian was up next and Paseka put in two vaults that yielded similar scores for an average 15.253. Biles headed the qualifiers with 16.050 but couldn’t match that in the final after her very difficult Amanar vault was not quite up to her high standard. Her 15.966, however, still gave her victory by 0.713 points and make it three golds out of three events. To put her winning margin into perspective, the difference between second placed Maria Paseka’s 15.253 and last placed Shallon Olsen’s 14.816 was only 0.437. For bronze medal winner Steingruber, she had the distinction of becoming the first Swiss gymnast, male or female to win an Olympic medal.

Boardman did this on a revolutionary bike that was made of a carbon-composite frame all molded from a single piece. It did not have the standard central triangular frame, but had special disc wheels and the by-now standard triathlon-type handlbars. On the bike, Boardman proved exceptionally fast. In the first round, Boardman dispatched even his qualifying world record, breaking the timer in 4:24.496 after overtaking Denmark’s Jan Bo Petersen. In the final, Lehmann had his chance against Boardman, but the Brit proved his superiority. For the first time in Olympic history, the final was ended by a capture, as Boardman overtook Lehmann with a lap to go, an unheard of dominance at this level of competition. Boardman turned professional and won the prologue at the 1994 Tour de France. He was also professional pursuit World Champion in 1994 and 1996. He and his countryman, Graeme Obree, who had designed an even more revolutionary bike, spent the early 90s trading the world hour record back and forth. Eventually, the Union Cycliste International (UCI) stepped in and decreed that such records had to be set on more traditional bikes, and the record reverted to the 1972 mark set by Belgium’s Eddy Merckx.

The gold medal turned out to be a rare tie between American Simone Manuel and Canadian prodigy Penny Oleksiak, who had only turned 16 two months before the Rio Games, and was quite unknown. Sjoström seemed off the podium until the last few strokes when she caught Bronte Campbell to win the bronze. The only other gold medal tie in this event had occurred at the 1984 Olympics between Americans Nancy Hogshead and Carrie Steinseifer. It was only the third such tie in Olympic swimming, the other one occurring in the 2000 men’s 50 freestyle.

He held that to the end, posting the fastest intermediate splits at all the final checkpoints, and winning a very easy gold medal, 36 seconds ahead of Norway’s Frode Estil. Veerpalu and Estil had also been 1-2 at the 2001 World Championships over 30 km. In this event, Veerpalu had been runner-up at the 1999 Worlds. Veerpalu’s teammate, Jaak Mae, started slowly but had moved to third by 11.5 km checkpoint. His bronze would give Estonia two medals in this event, and Veerpalu was the first Estonian to win a Winter Olympic gold medal. He would return in 2006 to defend his gold medal. Estil would win the 15 km World Championship in 2005.

The Americans were close behind and they had the #1 player in the rankings with Nelly Korda, who was joined on the USA team by her sister Jessica Korda, Lexi Thompson, and Danielle Kang. The Kordas were the daughters of Petr Korda, formerly the #2 tennis player in the world, and Regina Rajchrtová, also a world class tennis player, and they had a brother, Sebastian Korda, who had recently reached the fourth round at Wimbledon, but he declined to play the Tokyo Olympic tournament.
Form would hold as Nelly Korda opened the tournament with a 67, to lead after round one alongside India’s unheralded Aditi Ashok, who was ranked #200 in the world coming into the Olympics. In the second round Korda produced the round of the tournament, carding a 62 to take a three-shot lead over Ashok and two Danes – Emily Kristine Pedersen and Nanna Madsen.
A steady 69 in round three saw Korda maintain her three-stroke advantage over Ashok, with four players two shots further back – Madsen, defending silver medallist and former world #1 Lydia Ko of New Zealand, Australia’s Hannah Green, and Japan’s hope, Mone Inami, ranked #28 in the world as the Olympics started.
Nelly Korda held on to win the gold medal, although she struggled on the back nine in round four, and at one time was tied by both Inami and Ko. However, when Inami bogeyed the final hole, a tough par 4 with an approach shot over water, Korda parred it to become Olympic Champion. Inami and Ko stood in second place at 16 under, and played off for the silver and bronze medals, with Inami winning silver on the first play-off hole, the 18th, as Ko bogeyed. The bronze medal did at least make Ko the first golfer to win two individual Olympic medals.

He stopped 30 metres short of the finish, and tried to turn off the course. But the crowd yelled at him that he had not yet crossed the finish line, and he returned to the course, disoriented and walked across the finish line, taking over two minutes to finish his last 30 metres.

Randori means “chaos taking” or “grasping freedom,” and is contrasted to the more structured practice of kata. Aikido was developed by Morihei Ueshiba to synthesize martial arts, philosophy, and religious beliefs. Aikido may be translated as “the Way of unifying (with) life energy” or as “the Way of harmonious spirit.” Sixteen (16) different shiai events were demonstrated at Tokyo in 1964 as part of the kendo demonstrations.

But in the first round he was upset by Finland’s Kyösti Luukko, which meant that Johansson had to win all his later matches by falls to garner the gold medal – so he did, winning as expected. Luukko held on for the silver medal, losing by fall in the third round to American Robert Hess, which cost Luukko the gold medal. The bronze went to Hungarian József Tunyogi, who won his first three matches before losing in the medal round to Luukko by fall.
Four days later, Johansson would win another gold medal in Greco-Roman wrestling, making him the first Olympic wrestler to win gold medals in freestyle and Greco-Roman at the same Olympics.

Eschbach, Germany” for the work “Ode to Sport,” which was submitted in three languages - French, English, and German.  But in reality, the poetic ode had been written by Pierre, Baron de Coubertin, who entered it in the competitions under the dual pseudonym.  Coubertin had used the name Georges Hohrod previously, publishing an autobiographic novel Le Roman d’un rallié, under that pseudonym in 1899.  It is believed that M. Eschbach was his wife, Marie (née Rothan), who grew up partly in Germany, and that she translated the work into German.
But what of the names Hohrod and Eschbach?  Until recently, the source of the names was not known.  But an article by Jean Durry in Olympic Review has shed light on the mystery.  Durry attempted to find the home in Luttenbach that had once belonged to the Rothan family, Coubertin’s in-laws. Driving in the Fecht Valley near Alsace, Durry came across the small town of Hohrodberg.  Very near Hohrodberg, Durry also found the small town of Eschbach-au-Val. Although he does not describe it in as much detail, this was noted earlier (1994) by Norbert Müller, who wrote in a footnote in his book on Olympic Congresses, “The author of this book discovered that the pseudonyms Hohrod and Eschbach were the names of two neighboring villages of the native village of Coubertin’s wife, Luttenbach, near Colmar.”
