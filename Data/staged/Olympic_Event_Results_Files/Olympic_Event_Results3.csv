319027,"Double Sculls, Men",2012 Summer Olympics,54,Rowing,/editions/54/sports/ROW,28 July –  2 August 2012,"Eton Dorney, Windsor",26 from 13 countries,na,na,"The veteran Australian duo David Crawshay and Scott Brennan returned in 2012 to defend the gold medal that they had won in the previous Olympics. Their greatest challengers were the New Zealand boat paddled by Nathan Cohen and Joseph Sullivan, who had won the last two World Championships, as well as the Germans Stephan Krüger and Eric Knittel, who had emerged victorious at the 2009 World Championships and had a strong record going into the event. Also a factor were Luka Špik and Iztok Čop of Slovenia. Although they had finished only sixth at the 2008 Games, they had a distinguished rowing history in double sculls that included victories at the 1999, 2005, and 2007 World Championships, silver at the 2004 Summer Olympics, and gold at the 2000 edition. Čop had an additional Olympic medal, bronze from the 1992 Games’ coxless pairs event, and another World Championship gold from 1995 in the single sculls.
Of these four teams, however, only two would make it to the finals, as Australia and Germany were eliminated in the semi-finals. In the final Slovenia took an early lead and held it through the first half of the race, but they were eventually overtaken by the Italian team of Alessio Sartori and Romano Battisti. Battisti was a newcomer to the Olympics, but Satori was a seasoned veteran: an Olympian since 1996, he had earned gold in the quadruple sculls in 2000 and bronze in the double sculls alongside Rossano Galtarossa in 2004. He was also a three-time World Champion in quadruple sculls, earning his victories in 1994, 1995, and 1998. The Italians held the lead until the final stretch of the course, but could not hold off the New Zealanders, who were known for their strong sprints. In fact, Cohen and Sullivan had been in last position at the 500m mark, and had only advanced to fifth and third at the 1000m and 1500m marks respectively. Nonetheless they unleashed a fantastic sprint as the line approached and overtook the Italians with relative ease, leaving the veteran Slovenians to settle for bronze.

Jordyn Wieber was the reigning World Champion and thus the favorite among her teammates to win the event but, in the qualification round, the Americans finished second, third, and fourth, with Wieber behind her teammates Aly Raisman and Gabby Douglas. The competition had a “two finalists per country” rule, meaning that the World Champion was eliminated from the event. Viktoriya Komova of Russia, the runner-up at the World Championships, had finished first and was now in a better position to win the gold medal, but the stellar performances from the Americans made this far from certain.
In the final Douglas had the highest marks on the vault and the balance beam and, having finished third on the uneven bars, was in an excellent position to be crowned Olympic champion, even after slipping to fourth in the floor exercise. The only competitor with a realistic hope of overtaking her was Komova, who had finished third in the vault and second on the uneven bars and balance beam. The Russian would have needed a score of over 15.300, higher than the eventual top mark in the event, to surpass Douglas and was unable to meet it, scoring a 15.100 that still put her far above the two contenders for bronze. At the end of the tournament, Raisman had tied the score of Russian Aliya Mustafina, the 2010 World Champion, necessitating a tie-breaker to determine the final podium spot. The winner was determined by taking the total of their top three events, which gave the bronze medal to the Russian with a score of 45.933 against the American’s 45.366.

Finland’s Veikko Huhtanen won silver, while Reusch’s teammates, Christian Kipfer and Sepp Stalder, shared the bronze medal, with Switzerland taking four of the top five places, as Walter Lehmann placed fifth.

All fighters losing to the finalists in each pool advance to repêchage tournament for the bronze medal.,na,"The oldest contestant was legendary American athlete Steve Lopez, the 13 seed, who had five individual world titles to his name and three Olympic medals, going back to Sydney 2000, when he won the lightweight gold medal. He became the first exponent to compete in five Olympics and whilst he was not fancied to win a medal, one could never rule out a person of his experience. Two English-born athletes took part in this division – Lutalo Muhammad and Aaron Cook. Muhammad represented Great Britain while Cook represented Moldova after he fell out with the British team after failing to gain selection for the 2012 Games. Cook is the boyfriend of Bianca Walkden, the British 67kg world champion.
Crowd-pleaser Cook was seeded number two with the Ivory Coast’s Cheick Sallah Cissé third and Russia’s “Clown Prince of Taekwondo” Albert Gaun seeded four. The fifth seed was Britain’s Muhammad, the man who kept Cook out of the GB team in 2012 and went on to win bronze. A clash between Cook and Muhammed was eagerly anticipated in Rio. The top seed, Iran’s Mehdi “The Terminator” Khodabakhshi, however, had dominated this weight division since 2004 and, as the reigning world champion, was favourite for gold.
Everything went according to plan for most of the top seeds in the round of 16, except for Aaron Cook who was surprisingly beaten by the 15th seed Liu Wei-Ting of Chinese Taipei, and the number four seeded Russian Gaun went out to the 37-year-old Lopez. The American lost in the next round, however, to the fancied Muhammad whilst the top seed Khodabakhshi lost 17-5 to Milad Beigi Harçeqani of Azerbaijan on the 12 points lead rule. The Ivory Coast’s Cissé went through to the semi-final where he beat Oussama Oueslati of Tunisia 7-6 and set up a final meeting with Britain’s Muhammad, who beat Khodabakhshi’s conqueror Beigi 12-7, and what a final it turned out to be.
Muhammad connected with Cissé’s head to take a 3-0 lead in the first round. After both fighters received a penalty point, Cissé connected with the head for his own three-pointer and the two men were level at the end of round two. With less than a minute to go Muhammad scored with a body shot and then with a penalty point each the Briton was heading for the gold medal as the seconds counted down with him leading 6-5. With one second showing on the clock it was disaster for Muhammad as Cissé connected with a head kick in the very last action of the contest and he gave the Ivory Coast its first ever Olympic gold medal in any sport. Officials later confirmed that Cissé’s winning kick was one tenth of a second from the end of the contest. Tenth seed Oussama Oueslati and ninth seed Milad Beigi won their respective bronze medal matches.

Willy den Ouden was the silver medallist in Los Angeles whilst still only fourteen and the intervening years had seen her lower the world record on four occasions and by a total of two seconds. The time of 1:04.6 she set early in 1936 would stand until broken at the Melbourne Olympics twenty years later. Although den Ouden did not swim her very best in qualifying, she easily reached the final as Jeannette Campbell of Argentina and another young Dutchwoman, Rie Mastenbroek, were winners of the semi-finals. Den Ouden faltered at the start and lost ground as Campbell and Gisela Arendt forged ahead. Rie Mastenbroek swam a patient race and although only fifth at the turn, she swam past tiring rivals and produced a sprint finish that propelled her past her opponents to touch the wall first. Campbell became the first South American woman to win an Olympic medal whilst Arendt, by then the mother of a six year old son, reappeared in Olympic competition in the 1952 Helsinki Games.

In the final Knape led after four dives, while Soviet Irina Kalinina, the 1975 World Championship runner-up, moved ahead after five dives. But on the sixth dive, Kalinina’s teammate, the completely unknown Yelena Vaytsekhovskaya nailed her back 2½ pike and moved into the lead. She was never headed and won a very surprise gold medal. Knape placed second, adding silver to her 1972 gold, while the bronze went to American Debbie Wilson, who had won the US Olympic Trials. Knape was only fourth going into the final dive but her inward 2½ earned her 63.18 points to move up to second.

It was designed by John Barry, who rode for the USA at the 1920 and 1924 Olympics, and Sloan Doak, an Olympian in 1920-28, and had 18 obstacles and 20 jumping efforts over a length of 1,060 metres. Further, three refusals by a horse disqualified horse and rider and this rule, and the course difficulty, meant that only five riders finished the event. No team had three riders finish the course, so all the teams were disqualified and no medals were awarded.

Of the 20 bouts contested in the division all bar one were decided by judges’ decision.  The American Joseph Lazarus was the unlucky victim of disqualification in his bout against Oscar Andrén of Sweden. The Swede was knocked out but the referee, Sigel of France, ruled Lazarus had struck his opponent illegally, disobeying instructions to step back from a clinch. Sigel would later apologize to US team officials for his mistaken decision but despite the urging of Andrén and Swedish team officials, no appeal was made.

Best six of seven scores to count for final placement.,na,"The 5.5-metre class is a three-person keelboat, which was designed to be similar to the 6-metre class, but was much smaller and less expensive. The boat’s design is related to a formula involving its length, displacement, and sail area, requiring that the formula be equal to 5.500 metres or less. The class was designed in 1937 by Charlie Nicholson. The class made its Olympic début in 1952 and remained on the Olympic Program through 1968. The event was raced on a 13.1 nautical mile (24.2 km) course, the same as for all the larger boats in Helsinki.

In 2005 Hungary had also lost the final of the World Championship to another remnant of Yugoslavia, this time Serbia & Montenegro. Since World War II, Hungary and Yugoslavia had been the top water polo powers in the world, with Hungary winning Olympic medals at 12 straight Olympics from 1928-80. But the Soviet-led boycott of 1984 had knocked them from their perch and Hungary had not won an Olympic medal since 1980.
That changed in Sydney, although they lost two matches in group play. But they qualified for the quarter-finals where they easily defeated Italy, 8-5, moving onto a match against their arch-rivals, Serbia & Montenegro, or what was remaining of Yugoslavia. Both semi-finals were close, Hungary winning 8-7, and Russia eliminating Spain by the same score. The final would come down to Hungary and Russia, best known for their historic 1956 match, which ended in a bloody brawl shortly after the Soviet Union had invaded Hungary. That match had ended in a 4-0 Hungarian victory but the 2000 final was not even that close. Hungary was well ahead after each period – 3-1, 8-2, 10-4 – finally winning 13-6 for their first Olympic water polo gold medal since 1976 in Montréal.
Defending Olympic champion Spain lost the bronze medal match to Serbia & Montenegro, 8-3. That was the final Olympic appearance for their star, Manuel Estiarte, competing in his sixth Olympics.

The competition began on Wednesday, 8 July with the first stage.  A 3-way tie for first place resulted after that stage between Charles Palmer, Richard Hutton, and John Postans.  The next day, the Canadians lodged an objection against the previous days’ scores and were allowed to shoot again.  Postans subsequently withdrew, and did not shoot the 2nd or 3rd stages.  The reason is not given in the shooting magazines, but it was presumably in anger over the Canadians being allowed to re-shoot.  Canada’s Walter Ewing scored 27 in the re-shoot of the second day to take a lead he never relinquished.  He had the top score in all three stages.

Nakanishi won but broke a rib in the process and would not win a medal. Gamba started out with a tough match against Serge Dyot (FRA), the 1984 European runner-up. But Gamba had little trouble, Dyot eventually submitting – twice, as the referee did not notice the first submission. Gamba made the final where he faced Korean An Byeong-Geun.

Zhou held on until the finish line, while the two Koreans were far enough in front to fight it out for silver (Lee) and bronze (Park).
After her title, Zhou was naturally ecstatic, and in an interview with Chinese television, she thanked her parents, who had supported her sports dreams, despite their poverty. While this would not have caused raised eyebrows in most of the world, it caused a stir in China, where athletes generally thank their country. IOC member Yu Zaiqing was quoted as saying: )It’s fine to thank your mom and dad [for the gold medal] but one needs to thank the country first and foremost), referring to the country’s government funded sports system.

30900,"Polo, Men",1900 Summer Olympics,2,Polo,/editions/2/sports/POL,28 May –  2 June 1900,"Polo Club de Paris, Bagatelle, Bois de Boulogne, Paris",19 from 4 countries,Single-elimination tournament.,na,"It is difficult to make sense of what was and was not the “Olympic” polo tournament in 1900.  Many different match scores, tournament results, and team rosters have been seen in the varying sources.  The reason for these problems is that there were actually four (4) different “main” polo tournaments which took place in Paris at almost the same time.  In fact, the “main” tournaments overlapped and were held at the same site: the Polo Grounds of the Bagatelle de Paris team at the Bois de Boulogne.
The four tournaments were contested as follows:  1) Grand Prix International d’Exposition – 28, 29, and 31 May (scheduled); 2) Prix de Longchamps – 30 May, 1 and 4 June; 3) Grand Prix International de Paris – 5, 7, and 9 June; and 4) Coupe de Bagatelle – 6, 8, and 11 June.  However, the 1900 Official Report lists the “Concours de Polo Hippique” as the event which began on 28 May and continued over several days.  This was the Grand Prix International d’Exposition, which also sounds more like the “Olympic” event as it was a title given to other similar events in other sports.  The Grand Prix International d’Exposition was scheduled for 28-29, and 31 May but the second- and third-day matches were postponed to 31 May and 2 June 1900.
The 1900 Olympic polo tournament also appears to have been a bit of a lark, with the players changing teams, and representing various nations with no real rhyme or reason.  The tournament was won by a team representing the Foxhunters Hurlingham Polo Club, which is in England.  However, riding for the team were two Americans and one Irish player.
In addition to the “main” tournaments described above, however, there were multiple other polo events contested during the 1900 Paris Exposition.  I term the above four events the “main” tournaments because they were the four events described in the 1900 Official Report.  It should be noted that although the 1900 Official Report mentioned “cing coupes internationales,” it then describes only four – the four mentioned above. 
We owe our knowledge of the other events to the Spanish Olympic historian Juan Fauria Garcia.  The following four events – Grand Prix de l’Ouverture, Grand Prix de Suresnes, Cup Match, and Grand Prix des Dames – are mentioned in an article in Citius, Altius, Fortius (later the Journal of Olympic History), “The First True Spanish Olympic Medalists,” by Fauria Garcia (Vol. 1, No. 2, pp. 6-7).  He wrote as follows, “The official book (1900 Official Report)  of “Exposition Universalle Internationale de 1900” concerning the Concours d’exercises physiques et de sports mentions only “Cing (5) coupes internationales,” but a rare Spanish book, published about 1930, entitled El Polo exists.  Written by Norman James Cinnamond James, a member of the Real Polo Club de Barcelona (founded 29 May 1896), the book explains the eight (8) events, with the winners as follows . . .”
In the article, Fauria Garcia listed the winners of the events and the team members.  Coverage of all the 1900 polo events is available primarily, however, in The New York Herald (Paris Edition) from 1900.  The newspaper covered all of the events and I have been able to discover game scores and descriptions for basically all of the events described by James and, later, by Fauria Garcia.  I have to say basically because some of the winning team rosters in The New York Herald (Paris Edition) do not agree with James and Fauria Garcia, but most do.
The 1900 polo events lasted from late May through early July.  The last event contested was the Grand Prix des Dames, which ended 9 July, and after which, The New York Herald (Paris Edition), noted, “This ends the polo season in Paris for 1900.”

Thirty riders qualified (coincidentally exactly the number who avoided any jumping faults) from the competition on the Tuesday evening. Then, the following day, a single round of jumping was followed by a jump-off for the medals amongst those who rode faultless rounds. The qualifying round put paid to the chances of the entire American team and 2012 champion Steve Guerdat (SUI), but most of the favourites progressed to the final without great difficulty.
Eight riders completed the final without knocking any of the fences over but, unfortunately for them, Cian O’Connor of Ireland and Scott Brash of Great Britain missed the fight for the medals by finishing 0.4 seconds each over the required time. Of the six that did reach the jump-off, three were from the World Championship silver medal winning team from Sweden and one each from the Netherlands, Great Britain, and Japan.
The first three to go in the jump-off all went clear and all improved their predecessor’s time, but then Great Britain’s Ben Maher and the nimble footed Explosion W edged ahead of Peder Fredricson by only 0.17 of a second. The last two could not improve on Maher and Fredricson, although Maikel van der Vleuten did edge out Henrik von Eckermann to win bronze.

Modified Bergvall system for second-to-fifth place.,na,"In water polo, Belgium narrowly defeated The Netherlands and Sweden in getting to the final, while Great Britain made their way laughingly to the finals. Still, the nationalistic Belgian fans expected a hometown victory. The match was closely contested, with Britain eventually winning 3-2. Britain scored first, with Billy Dean recording the opening goal. But Belgium then took a 2-1 lead on two goals by Maurice Blitz. Britain tied the score at the half with another goal by Dean. In the second half, Paul Radmilovic of Britain scored the only goal, which proved to be the winning margin. The Belgian fans were quite unhappy and attempted to attack the British players, who were led away under an armed guard.
This made the third consecutive gold medal for Great Britain in water polo, having also won the title in 1908 and 1912. They had also won the Olympic championship in 1900 at Paris. Two British players earned three gold medals from 1908-1920 - Charles Smith and Paul Radmilovic, while a third, Charles Bugbee, had played for Great Britain in both 1912 and 1920. Smith represented Salford Swim Club in 1908, but Southport Swim Club in 1912 and 1920. He was England’s goalkeeper in water polo for 25 years and also competed at the 1924 Olympics, in which Great Britain lost in the first round to Hungary. Bugbee was a City of London policeman who also competed in 1924.
In addition to his three water polo gold medals, Paul Radmilovic also swam on the British 4×200 freestyle relay team that won gold in 1908. Radmilovic competed in Olympic water polo again in 1924 and 1928. An excellent swimmer, he won his first national swimming title in 1901 and the last in 1929 and he won championships at distances from 100 yards to 5 miles. In 1967 he was the first Briton to be inducted into the International Swimming Hall of Fame.
Per the 1920 Official Report there was a tournament for second-to-fifth place. The exact details of this tournament are murky. The _1920 Official Report does list the placements down to fifth place but it is difficult to tell placements beyond fifth place.

The tournament then proceeded on a single-elimination basis. No nations were making their début at Olympic hockey, and no one team had been dominant since the previous Olympics. Arguably the favourites were Australia and Belgium, each of whom had topped the FIH world rankings in recent years. Argentina, the reigning Olympic champions from 2016, had since slipped down the world rankings and were not considered amongst the favourites to retain their title.
In Pool A, Australia comfortably qualified at the top of the group; the only match they did not win was their last match against Spain (1-1), when they had already qualified for the elimination rounds. India finished second in the group, despite losing 7-1 to Australia. Reigning Olympic champions Argentina along with Spain were the other qualifiers, Argentina defeating New Zealand 4-1 to qualify in their final pool match.
In Pool B, Belgium was equally as dominant, only failing to win their last match against Great Britain (2-2) when both teams had already qualified for the elimination stage – Belgium winning the group and the British team finishing third. Germany finished as runners-up in the group, while the Netherlands was the final qualifier.
The quarter-finals were mostly comfortable contests, Germany defeating the reigning champions Argentina by a score of 3-1, with similar score lines for Belgium against Spain and India against Great Britain. The only close contest was between Australia and the Netherlands with the scores finishing 2-2 at full-time, Australia going on to win the shootout by a score of 3-0.
Belgium defeated India 5-2 in the first of the semi-finals. Loick Luypaert put Belgium ahead with an early goal, but India fought back to lead 2-1 at the end of the first quarter, Harmanpreet Singh and Mandeep Singh scoring the goals. Belgium came back strongly with three goals from Alexander Hendrickx (2 penalty corners and one penalty stroke) followed by a late goal from John-John Dohmen, although it wasn’t until the final quarter that Belgium exerted their dominance.
The second semi-final was a much closer affair. Australia opened the scoring through Tim Brand, but Germany quickly equalised with a penalty corner converted by Lukas Windfeder. Australia retook the lead in the second quarter through Blake Govers, who converted a penalty corner. Although Germany pressed for an equaliser, it was Australia who scored a third goal from Lachlan Sharp in the closing minutes when Germany had taken off their goalkeeper, as Australia advanced to the final, winning by 3-1.
In a thrilling match for the bronze medal, India won their first medal since 1980 when they defeated Germany 5-4. Timur Oruz opened the scoring for Germany after 2 minutes, but in the second quarter Simranjeet Singh equalised for India. Two quick goals from Niklas Wellen and Benedikt Fürk saw Germany take a 3-1 lead, but two goals from penalty corners by Hardik Singh and Harmanpreet Singh saw India level the score. In the third quarter Rupinder Singh put India ahead with a penalty stroke, and Simranjeet Singh scored a fifth goal for India shortly afterwards. Lukas Windfeder scored for Germany at the start of the final quarter, but although they were dominant for the remainder of the match, Germany could not find the equalising goal.
The final was a tense affair between two closely matched teams, each team’s defence largely being in command. Belgium finally broke the deadlock when Florent van Aubel scored in the third period, only for Tom Wickham to equalise in the final quarter. So, a shootout was required, and it was the team from Belgium who won it 3-2 to claim their first ever gold medal in Hockey, an improvement on the silver medal they had won in 2016. Australia, for the fourth time, were defeated in an Olympic hockey final.

Defending champion Roberto Cammarelle was joined in London by world champion Məhəmmədrəsul Məcidov of Azerbaijan, Beijing finalist Zhang Zhilei of China and the rising young British talent Anthony Joshua.
Though cheered on fanatically by the home support Joshua was nearly eliminated in his first fight and was fortunate to be given the decision over Cuban Erislandy Savón, nephew of the legendary Félix Savón. Joshua improved on this display in his next fights and reached the final with a victory over Russia’s Ivan Dychko while in the other semi-final Cammarelle won a close but deserved decision over Məcidov. The final bout between the Italian and the Briton, whilst not a classic, turned into a nail-biter. For the first two rounds the more streetwise and experienced Cammarelle kept the young British fighter at bay but a desperate attack in the third brought Joshua back into contention. Neutral observers were a little surprised when the score was announced as a tie and the Italian contingent were certainly unhappy when Joshua was awarded the fight on countback.
Joshua’s victory denied Cammarelle the honour of becoming the first man to defend an Olympic title in the heaviest weight category since Teófilo Stevenson.

Challenging him for the title were Australia’s Sam Willoughby, the reigning World Champion, and Frenchman Joris Daudet, the 2011 World Champion,  along with a host of other prospects who were, relatively, much younger than Štrombergs. In an event as unpredictable as BMX, however, nearly every rider who started had at least some chance of bringing home a medal.
The first surprises came in the qualification when Raymon van der Biezen and Twan van Gendt, members of the Dutch team, posted the best and third-best times of the seeding run respectively, sandwiching Daudet in-between them. The Netherlands, which had not seen a men’s World Championship medalist since Robert de Wilde in 2005, had not been thought to be a medal contender in the event, but quickly established itself as a nation to watch for at the podium. The Dutch team continued their dominance in the quarterfinals, with both van Gendt and van der Biezen winning their finals alongside American Connor Fields and New Zealander Marc Willers. Fields and Willoughby were the stars of the semi-finals, each winning two of their three runs, while Willers and Daudet crashed in their first and third runs respectively and were eliminated from the finals. Willers attempted to continue the competition and rode in the second race, although it was clear that his crash had hampered his performance and he did not start the third race. In the final Štrombergs, who had only won one of the six races of the quarter and semi-finals, took an early lead and never relinquished it. Willoughby was on his tail the entire time, but his final push came up just short and he was left to settle for silver. Throughout the race hometown favorite Liam Phillips looked poised to take the bronze medal, but crashed as he was passed by Carlos Oquendo of Colombia, a relative unknown, who finished in third place. Fields had also fallen during the race, but he had had a bad start and was never in contention for the podium.

Reigning Olympic Champion Lee Sang-Hwa had dominated the event since her somewhat surprising victory in Vancouver. She had won the 2012 and 2013 world titles (2nd in 2011), and since November 2012 had lost only a single 500 m World Cup race. She had beaten the World Record four times in 2013, lowering it from 36.94 to a 36.36. Few other skaters had managed to beat 37 seconds, and Wang Beixing’s 36.85 was the best time not set by Lee. Wang’s compatriot Yu Jing, a former World Record holder, was missing in Sochi, suffering from a hip injury. Together with Wang, American skater Heather Richardson, home favorite Olga Fatkulina and former record holder Jenny Wolf of Germany were highly considered for a medal.
The surprise of the first run was Zhang Hong, another Chinese sprinter. Despite a modest 10.79 opening she recorded the fastest full lap and set the third time of the first run with 37.58. Only in pair 16 could Fatkulina beat that time (by 0.01), enthusiastically cheered on by the crowd. As expected, Lee’s time in the final pair was faster, but with 37.42 the gap was not as large as it had been in earlier competitions. The other favorites were all still in contention as well, and were joined by Margot Boer in 5th and Nao Kodaira in 7th.
Boer was the first of these favorites to hit the ice in the second run, and she slightly improved on her first run mark for a 75.48 total. The time would only be beaten by two skaters in the second run, as Richardson (38.02), Zhang (37.99), Wolf (37.73) and Kodaira (37.72) all had slightly worse times. Fatkulina, however used the crowd’s energy to power to 37.49. Lee’s position never seemed in danger, however, and she demonstrated that by finishing in a new Olympic Record of 37.28 - giving 74.70 as her total, another Olympic Record. This made Lee the third woman to retain her Olympic 500 m title, after Bonnie Blair (who won it at three consecutive Olympics) and Catriona Le May Doan.
In May 2016 WADA (World Anti-Doping Agency) commissioned a report, the McLaren Report, to look into allegations of systematic Russian doping and a cover-up to avoid positives at the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics. The report was released in two parts, in July and December 2016, and confirmed the allegations. In 2017 the IOC formed a commission to investigate this, headed by IOC Member Denis Oswald, and usually referred to as the Oswald Commission. In late October 2017 the Oswald Commission began to release its findings.
On 22 November 2017 the silver medalist in this event, Olga Fatkulina was disqualified based on findings from the Oswald Commission. She immediately appealed this ruling to the Court of Abritration for Sport (CAS), and about 10 days before the PyeongChang Winter Olympics began, the CAS reached a decision and Fatkulina was exonerated and her silver medal was restored.

Straßberger won the 1929 European title and then won a bronze medal at that event in 1930-31 and 1933-34, while Luhaäär finished second at the 1933 Europeans and a bronze at the 1938 Worlds. Skobla had won the last World Championships held in this era, as a light-heavyweight, back in 1923. His son, Jiří Skobla, won a shot put bronze medal at the 1956 Olympics.

Gould almost pulled even on the breaststroke and then used her freestyle dominance to pull away for the expected gold medal in a world record 2:23.07. Behind her, Vidali faded on the final lap and was passed by 13-year-old East Germany Kornelia Ender, Vidali winning bronze. Ender would win three medals in Munich, adding two in relays, but she would be heard from much more in Montréal, winning five medals there, including four golds.

By Seoul she was the only woman to have scored 600 points on springboard, which she had done three times. She was unable to get that total at the 1988 Olympics, as the judges were scoring rather low, but her 580.23 won the title by 45.90 points over her countrywoman, Li Qing, who made her only Olympic appearance in this event. The bronze medal went to American Kelly McCormick, the 1984 silver medalist, whose mother, Pat McCormick, had won the original diving double-double in 1952-56. Nicknamed the “Diving Queen,” Gao would retire as the greatest springboard diver ever among women to that time. She really never lost at the major international level, adding a second Olympic gold in 1992. At the World Championships she won the 3-metre event in 1986 and 1991 and the 1-metre in 1991.

Formerly part of Yugoslavia, this small country had won just one women’s Olympic gold medal prior to 2016, and Trstenjak’s gold doubled the tally with both golds being won in the same sport and event.
Although not high in the official ranking list, fighting in front of her home crowd, Brazil’s Mariana Silva started as one of the favorites. However, the 2016 Pan American Games gold medalist was defeated in the semi-final by Trstenjak who scored an Ippon (full point) with a Tate-shiho-gatam (Straight four-corner hold) 3:39 min into the match. In the final, the Slovenian faced second seed Clarisse Agbegnenou from France. The two top athletes in this division had already met in the finals of the European and World Championships with Trstenjak winning the most recent bout. In the Rio final, the 25-year-old overpowered the younger Frenchwoman, with Togolese roots, with an Ippon after only 1:45 min, applying a Kuzure-kami-shiho-gatame (Modified top four-corner hold) to clinch the gold.
Home favorite Silva also missed her second chance to win a medal, losing the bronze medal match against Netherlands’ Anicka Van Emden by Yuko (Advantage). For the second bronze medal, third-seeded Miku Tashiro from Japan faced Israel’s fourth-seeded Yarden Gerbi. Gerbi’s victory by Waza-ari gave Israel its first medal in the Rio Games and made this event the first without a medal for Japan.

Ties broken by lightest bodyweight.,na,"While the four lightest women’s weight classes moved up by only 1 kg after Rio, the higher categories saw bigger changes, with the light-heavyweight class being increased by 7 kg up to 76 kg. This also made a gap of 12 kg of bodyweight between middleweight (64 kg) and light-heavy, but that was also due to the fact that, unlike the World Championships, a 71 kg class was not contested at the Olympics.
The two dominant athletes in the 76 kg class, Rim Jong-Sim and Zhang Wangli (CHN), season best 263 kg, did not participate in Tokyo. The two-time Olympic gold medallist Rim was out of the Games as PRK decided not to send a team to the Olympics due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and Zhang missed the Games as China could only send four female lifters to Tokyo and she was left out of the squad. Rim was the reigning world champion from 2019, and Zhang won the last Asian championships held in April 2021. Both had also been world record holders, with Rim in snatch (124 kg) and total (278 kg), and Zhang in clean & jerk (156 kg). No other lifter in this category at Tokyo had set a world record. Also missing was Leidy Solís, qualification best 256 kg and reigning world champion in the 81 kg class, after she was cut from the squad when the Colombian Weightlifting Federation was sanctioned due to the high number of doping offences. The top athletes present in Tokyo were Neisi Dajomes, season best 261 kg, Aremi Fuentes, qualification best 250 kg, Iryna Dekha, season best 248 kg, Kim Su-Hyeon, season best 244 kg, and the reigning 71 kg world champion Kate Nye, who lifted 248 kg in that event.
After three valid lifts in snatch, Dajomes had a solid lead with 118 kg. She was followed by Dekha with 113 kg, Nye with 111 kg, Fuentes with 108 kg, and Kim with 106 kg. In clean & jerk, Dekha failed to clear 131 kg three times and was out of the competition before the other medal contenders had even started their attempts. The next to finish was Fuentes, with a best lift of 137 kg for a total of 245 kg, which was good enough for second place at that time, but she was overtaken by Nye with her next lift of 138 kg for a total of 248 kg. Dajomes lifted 135 kg, and later improved to 140 kg and 145 kg to secure the gold medal. Meanwhile Kim failed to lift 138 kg and while trying to go for bronze also missed twice at 140 kg, which left her without a valid lift in clean & jerk.
The Olympic Standard for Olympic records was 121 kg for snatch, 149 kg for clean & jerk, and 270 kg for total. None of these records were broken at in Tokyo.
Dajomes, who enjoyed a perfect competition with six valid lifts, became the first Olympic weightlifting medallist for Ecuador, the first female Olympic medallist for Ecuador ever, and only the third Ecuadorian athlete to win an Olympic medal in history. It was also the third Olympic gold medal for Ecuador after 20 km walker Jefferson Pérez in 1996, and cyclist Richard Carapaz eight days earlier at the Tokyo Games. Nye won the fourth Olympic weightlifting medal by an American woman, while the US men have been waiting since 1984 for a medal. Also, Fuentes won the fourth Olympic weightlifting medal by a woman for Mexico, while the Mexican men have never won an Olympic weightlifting medal. Finishing ninth in this event was Mahassen Fattouh who became the first ever female Olympic weightlifter for Lebanon after qualifying via the Asia Continental Ranking.

She was somewhat of an unknown factor as she had never beaten the East Germans head on, and was only 16th in the world in 1987. In the prelims Hörner confirmed her fitness, leading in 2:27.63, within ½-second of Higson’s world mark, while Higson qualified fourth.
In the final, the pace through 100 metres was set by Bulgarian Tanya Dangalakova, who was recovering from having a baby in June 1987, and having surgery related to it in October 1987. But then Hörner took over, winning in a world record 2:26.71, well ahead of China’s Huang Xiaomin.

In fact, the final came down to 11 vaulters, eight of them American, with lone athletes from Canada, Germany, and Sweden.  There was no clear American favorite.
A review of recent performances shows how open the competition would be among the United States’ vaulters.  The most recent AAU titles had been won as follows:  1909 - Roy Paulding, 1910 - Harry Babcock, and 1911 - a three-way tie between Ed Cook, Frank Coyle, and Sam Bellah.  Cook was the defending Olympic champion, having shared the 1908 gold medal with A. C. Gilbert.  The three U.S. Olympic trials, went as follows:  Western - Bellah won; Central - Frank Murphy won, with Coyle second; and Eastern - Marc Wright won, with Frank Nelson second.
The world record had also taken a recent beating by the American vault crew.  At the beginning of 1912, the mark stood at 3.93, set in Boulder, Colorado on 27 May 1910 by Leland Scott.  But at the IC4A title in Philadelphia on 1 June 1912, Yale’s Robert Gardner won, clearing 3.985 (13-1), the first 13-foot vault.  The mark lasted only a week, as Marc Wright won the eastern Olympic Trial with the first four-metre vault, clearing 13-2¼ (4.02).
Of the above mentioned American vaulters, all but Cook, Gilbert, Paulding, and Gardner competed at Stockholm, giving the United States six top vaulters from which to choose.  Among other nations, the Swedes championed Bertil Uggla, while Canada sent William Halpenny, who had been United States’ AAU champion in 1908 and would win the Canadian championship in 1911-1913.
The final six vaulters came down to Uggla, Halpenny, and four Americans - Babcock, Nelson, Wright and Murphy.  At 3.85 metres, Halpenny had to withdraw, having broken two ribs in clearing 3.80.  He was joined by Uggla and Murphy who failed to clear 3.85.  At 3.85, Harold Babcock cleared on his first attempt, while Nelson and Wright needed two efforts.  But when the bar was raised to 3.95, only Babcock was successful, again on one attempt.  He took three shots at a new world record of 4.06 (13-3¾) but failed.

Team/individual competitions held concurrently.",na,"The team and individual jumping were held concurrently with the team jumping passively scored by combining the scores of the three team members. There were 18 teams entered but only 7 managed to have three riders finish the course. The course was designed by August Andreae, who also designed the cross-country courses. The jumping course had 13 fences and 20 jumps spread over 1,050 metres, as the one double and three triple combinations had to be jumped from both sides. The obstacles were between 1.30-1.60 metres in height, but for the jump-off most obstacles were raised and some distances were changed, with the water jump widened from 5.00 to 5.50 metres.
Germany won the gold medal comfortably, led by the individual champion, Kurt Hasse. They were trailed by the Netherlands, which is traditionally strong in horse events, and Portugal won the bronze medal, as they had done in this event in 1924.

In a major surprise, even to the French fans, France shutout Belgium, 3-0, to win the gold medal. Belgium entered the second-place tournament, held in Bergvall style, defeating Sweden, 4-3, and then meeting the United States in the silver-medal match. Belgium defeated the US, 2-1, but the Americans protested, which was allowed, only to see Belgium win silver by the same score in the replay. Hungary, Czechoslovakia, and Sweden met in the third-place tournament, with Sweden defeating both teams to meet the United States, which was seeded in as a result of losing the final match in the second-place tournament. The US narrowly defeated the Swedes, 3-2, to take the bronze medal, in an upset. Sweden had won medals in the sport in 1908, 1912, and 1920. Hungary placed fifth. The next time they would not medal in the sport, at an Olympics in which they competed, would be 1988.

Dukatova was ranked number one in the world and was a favorite going into the event. The reigning World Champion was Corinna Kuhnle of Austria, who first won the title in 2010. Other notable participants included Germany’s Jasmin Schornberg, the 2009 World Champion, Štěpánka Hilgertová of the Czech Republic, who had competed in the event in every edition of the Games since 1992 (winning in 1996 and 2000), and Australian Jessica Fox, daughter of former World Champions Myriam and Richard Fox.
In this relatively more open field, each of the rounds had its share of unpredicted results. The fastest time in the heats came from Spain’s Maialen Chourraut, a silver and bronze medalist at the World Championships in 2009 and 2011 respectively, with Britain’s Lizzie Neave and Italy’s Clara Giai coming in second and third. In the semi-finals, however, both Neave and Giai were eliminated on penalties in a round won by Poland’s low-ranked Natalia Pacierpnik. In the final Fox, who had the best time in the semi-finals before penalties, went third and had an outstanding run, but was bested by France’s Émilie Fer, another surprise paddler whose only World Championship medal was gold in the K-1 Team Event in 2006. Third place was taken by Chourraut who, after near misses in the men’s C-1 and K-1 events, captured Spain’s first Olympic medal in canoe slalom. Hilgertová finished in fourth, 3.26 seconds off the podium, Dukatova in sixth, and Kuhnle in a distant last place in the final, having accrued 52 penalty points over the course.

Reigning two-time European Champion from Denmark Erik Larsen died shortly prior to the Olympics, leaving American Jack Kelly, Jr. (son of three-time Olympic rowing champion Jack Kelly, Sr.) as the sole gold medalist from that tournament to compete in Helsinki. Other notable competitors included Eduardo Risso of Uruguay, the defending Olympic silver medalist, Great Britain’s Tony Fox, winner of the 1951 Diamond Challenge Sculls and runner-up in 1952 and at the 1951 Europeans,  Paul Meyer of Switzerland, the reigning European bronze medalist, and Ian Stephen of South Africa, bronze medalist at the 1950 British Empire Games.
Fox, Wood, and Kelly won their heats in the opening round, along with Yury Tyukalov, who was representing the Soviet Union in its Olympic début. Fox and Tyukalov were the winners in the semi-finals, while Kelly was eliminated in the repêchage after being bested in his heat by Poland’s Teodor Kocerka. Stephan and Wood rounded out the final, which quickly developed into a race for gold between Tyukalov and Wood. The Australian led the charge for the first half, but Tyukalov gradually picked up his pace, for which Wood had no response. Tyukalov therefore captured the USSR’s first Olympic rowing gold medal, while Wood had to settle for second place. Kocerka, then almost as unknown as Tyukalov, bested Fox by over three seconds to take home bronze.

In contrast the French team of individual finalists Laura Flessel and Valérie Barlois-Mevel backed up by Sophie Moressée-Pichot were more consistent over the event and even when they made a slow start to a match they always finished strongly. This was evident in the final where they proceeded to win 15 of the final 20 points needed to claim their victory. Hungary, four times World Champions in the proceeding five years, was upset by Russia for bronze.

38025,"Water Polo, Men",1912 Summer Olympics,6,Water Polo,/editions/6/sports/WPO,7 – 16 July 1912,"Simstadion, Djurgårdsbrunnsviken, Stockholm",45 from 6 countries,Single-elimination tournament.,na,"Water polo had been contested at the 1900, 1904, and 1908 Olympics. The 1904 Olympic water polo had been conducted under some unusual rules and only American club teams competed. The 1900 and 1908 Olympic water polo tournaments had both been won by teams from Great Britain. The 1900 British team had all been members of the same club, the Osborne Swimming Club of Manchester, while the 1908 team was more a “national” team, with members from four differing clubs.
In 1912, the matches consisted of two periods of seven minutes each, effective playing time. In the event of a tie, two extra periods of three minutes each were played. The tournament was basically played according to the “Bergvall System“, named after Erik Bergvall, President of Svenska Simförbundet (Swedish Swimming Association). In the Bergvall System, second place was not awarded to the losing finalist, but a separate second-place tournament was conducted among all teams losing to the winning team. Similarly, a third-place tournament was then conducted among all teams losing to the second-place team. In this case, Belgium defeated both Hungary and France in matches for third place. Sweden had already defeated Austria in a match for second place, so Belgium then advanced to a final match against Sweden to decide second and third place.
Great Britain was the favorite again in 1912 and did not disappoint, winning the gold medal. In their first round match, however, they were severely tested by the Belgian team, only winning in overtime by 7-5. In fact, Belgium led 3-2 at the half, and took a 4-2 lead early in the second half before Paul Radmilovic scored two goals to tie the match at 4-4 in regulation. In the semi-finals, Great Britain played Sweden. They led 2-1 at the half, but Sweden pulled even, 3-3, shortly after intermission. Britain scored the last three goals to win, 6-3.  Having survived those two difficult matches, the final was easy for the British team. They defeated an overmatched Austrian team 8-0, scoring four goals in each half.
Four members of the winning 1908 British team returned to Stockholm in 1912 to defend the gold medal: George Wilkinson, Charles Smith, George Cornet, and Paul Radmilovic. Wilkinson, in fact, had also competed in 1900 for the Osborne Swimming Club team and thus had already won two water polo Olympic championships. Considered by many the first great water poloist, he started his career at the Osborne club before moving to the Hyde Seal Swim Club in 1902. He captained that water polo team for 22 years, and led them to nine Amateur Swimming Association titles, and an international victory over Brussels at the “World Championships” of 1904 in Paris.
Charles Smith represented the Salford Swimming Club, and won Olympic water polo gold medals in 1908, 1912, and 1920. He was goalie for the British national team from 1902 through 1926 and also competed at the Olympics of 1924. In winning his 1920 gold medal he was 41 years, 214 days old, making him the oldest Olympic water polo gold medalist.  Less is known about George Cornet, a member of the Inverness Swimming Club, but he did represent Scotland 17 times in water polo between 1897 and 1912.
Paul (Pavao) Radmilovic had one of the longest Olympic careers of any Olympic water poloist.  He competed in water polo at the Olympics of 1908, 1912, 1920, 1924, and 1928, one of only three Olympians to have competed in five water polo tournaments.  But because of World War I, his span of 20 years competing in Olympic water polo is the longest on record, although equalled by Paul Vasseur of France, who competed in 1900, 1906, 1912, and 1920.  Radmilovic also competed as a swimmer at the Olympics of 1906, 1908, and 1920, giving him six consecutive Olympic appearances between 1906 and 1928.  He won four Olympic gold medals in all - water polo in 1908, 1912, and 1920 and as a member of the winning 4×200 metre freestyle relay in 1908. Welsh-born of a Croatian father and an Irish mother, in 1967 he became the first Briton to be inducted into the Swimming Hall of Fame.

Based on previous results, it would be Gunda Niemann-Stirnemann. She had won the 1997 world title, and held the world record since 1990. She had also won the World Allround Championships six times between 1991 and 1997, winning the 3,000 m on each occasion. In 1992, she had won the Olympic title in this distance, losing it surprisingly in 1994 due to a fall. But Niemann’s compatriot Claudia Pechstein seemed like a serious contender. At the Berlin World Cup, she had beaten Niemann, and in December she had taken Niemann’s World Record, although in the absence of her rival.
The first skater to break the Olympic Record, dating back to 1988, was American Jennifer Rodriguez, a former inline skater with Cuban roots. Her 4:11.64 would eventually land her in 4th place. Her time was next beaten by upcoming German star, Anni Friesinger. The next pair saw Pechstein and Hunyady taking off fast. Hunyady fell behind after a few laps, but Pechstein kept up the pace until she slowed in the final two laps. She finished in 4:08.27.
Pechstein’s last laps left room for Niemann, whose splits were behind Pechstein’s until 2,200 m. But she managed to gain a second advantage in the final two laps, thereby taking her third Olympic gold medal after two titles in 1992. The German women swept the medals, as they had done in 1984, with the difference that back then, all three women had been from East Germany, while in Nagano, Friesinger was from the former West Germany.

Eventually five (Hungary, Egypt, South Vietnam, China and Turkey) of the qualified teams withdrew, leaving only eleven teams to play in Melbourne. The original draw had a first round of eight matches, but only three of those took place - Soviet Union vs. Germany, Great Britain vs. Thailand, and Australia vs. Japan. The scheduled first round match of Yugoslavia vs. United States was moved into the second round, or quarter-finals. The other first round matches scheduled were as follows: Bulgaria vs. Egypt, Hungary vs. India, Indonesia vs. South Vietnam, and China vs. Turkey. With China and Turkey not competing, that match was voided, while Bulgaria, India, and Indonesia were advanced into the quarter-final round.
Of the competing teams, the Soviet Union was heavily favoured to take the gold. They lived up to those expectations, although they did not play as well as expected, and needed a fair amount of luck. A combined German team narrowly lost 1-2 to the Soviets, who then progressed to a goalless draw against unheralded Indonesia. The Asians were dismissed 4-0 in the replay, and Bulgaria was their next opponent. After a goal-less 90 minutes, Bulgaria took the lead in extra time. The Bulgarians leaned back to finish the match easily, but the Soviets had a terrific comeback and decided the match in their favour with minutes to spare.
The Soviet’s opponent in final was Yugoslavia, which had lost the deciding match at the 1948 and 1952 Olympics. They had beaten surprise semi-finalist India, whose players were unaccustomed to wearing boots during the game. Yugoslavia once more had to settle for silver in Melbourne. They were unlucky not to get a penalty kick early in the game and a seemingly legal goal was cancelled for offside. The Soviet team’s star was their keeper, Lev Yashin. He is generally considered to be the best ever goalkeeper, and led the Soviets to the inaugural European title in 1960. He played his entire career for Dynamo Moskva, winning five domestic championships.

This would include Soviet Nina Statkevich, 1971 World Champion, who won the 1,500 at that event; Holland’s Atje Keulen-Deelstra, 1970 World Champion and recent winner of the 1972 European Championship, who had won the 1,500 at the Europeans; her teammate Stien Baas-Kaiser, at her best in the distances, and the world record holder at 2:15.8, set in January 1971 in Davos; and American Dianne Holum, who had won the 1,000 at the 1971 World Championships, and placed fourth overall at the Worlds in 1970 and 1971. Keulen-Deelstra was off in the first pair and set a mark to shoot at, 2:22.05. She waited for the fifth pair which featured Holum and Statkevich. They were together through 700 metres, and ahead of Keulen-Deelstra’s splits, but Holum then pulled away, finishing in 2:20.85, which would bring her the gold medal. Statkevich fell off, eventually finishing only sixth. Baas-Kaiser was in the 12th pair, but she started very slowly, and although she had the fastest final lap, she fell just short of catching Holum, finishing in 2:21.05 for a silver medal. Keulen-Deelstra’s time held up for the bronze. Holum would compete for only a few more weeks, at the 1972 World Sprints and World Championships, winning both 1,000s at the Sprints. She would then turn to coaching, later taking on a promising young Wisconsin skater named Eric Heiden. Holum’s daughter, Kirstin, would later skate for the US at the 1998 Nagano Olympics.

An additional 22 qualified through continental qualifying tournaments. There was also the possibility of qualifying in an international qualification tournament. Also, the best placed athlete in the ITTF world rankings who had not yet qualified received a quota place.
Like in Rio, the first rounds were limited to the lower ranked players. Higher ranked players were gradually introduced until the third round when the world’s 16 best ranked players joined the tournament. This scheme had already been applied in previous Olympics. All matches were played to the best-of seven, with the first to win four games taking the match.
China occupied the top three spots in the world ranking list but could only nominate two players who turned out to be top seed Fan Zhendong and third seed Ma Long. Ma Long had taken two team golds previously, and in Rio also won singles gold. Additionally, he won three singles and two doubles titles at World Championships. In 2010, he topped the world ranking list for the first time. Nearly nine years younger than Long, Fan Zhendong had never won the world singles title, but was once the doubles and three times the world team champion. Both Chinese players had to fight hard in their semi-finals going through seven games taking more than 80 minutes. Former world No. 1 Dimitrij Ovtcharov, the same age as Ma Long, never managed to beat the Chinese in 19 matches throughout their careers and maybe he never came closer to winning than in Tokyo before eventually losing the deciding last game by 11-9. In the second semi-final, the tournament fifth seed Lin Yun-Ju from Chinese Taipei was equally close to outplaying Fan Zhendong. In the final Ma Long had less difficulty to beat his compatriot 4-2. Ovtcharov of Germany, something like a specialist for long matches, trailed Lin Yun-Ju in the bronze medal match 3-2 but came back in a grueling sixth game saving four match points and eventually took bronze by winning the deciding seventh game. Like the final, the veteran, 32-years-old Ovtcharov, prevailed against one of the sport’s next generation, 19-years-old Lin.

Another former champion, Claudia Pechstein placed second at that World Cup. A nine-time Olympic medallist aged 41, she was hoping to add a record 10th medal to her collection. Despite not being a specialist in the event, Ireen Wüst was seriously considered for a medal, having already claimed three medals in Sochi, and having finished second behind Sáblíková at the 2013 Worlds. The Russian crowd was hoping that Olga Graf could replicate her bronze performance from the 3,000 m.
The first skater to beat 7 minutes was Carien Kleibeuker. A competitor in 2006, Kleibeuker had switched to the Dutch marathon skating circuit, but had decided to make one last attempt at Olympic success. Her 6:55.77 at least held off her pairmate Graf, who lost half a second in the final lap to finish only 0.11 behind the Dutchwoman. The 7th pair then saw Sáblíková and Wüst pitted against each other. As always, Wüst departed fast, and held the lead through 3,800 m. Sáblíková then powered past her rival, opening up a 2.74-second gap in the final three laps, to finish in 6:51.54. In the final pair, Claudia Pechstein kept up with the leader’s pace for about 6 laps, but then quickly fell back, dropping behind Kleibeuker with three laps left.

With much of the snow on the track gone, the second run was much faster, and the Stevens brothers broke the track record to trail by 3 seconds after the first day.
Overnight warming caused the track to become even faster, and the Swiss leaders broke their record once more in the third run. However, the home team, cheered on by 10,000, topped that, being nearly 4 seconds faster. The difference with just one run left was now 0.45 seconds. The Americans went first in the last descent, improving on their previous record once more and lowering it by two full seconds.

His training was in wrestling, and he did not even know his belt was supposed to go twice around his waist. But Buyadaa mauled Monnier in the match with his wrestling moves, and won by decision. The final was anti-climactic, as Buyadaa was no match for Kawaguchi’s skills. He took Buyadaa down in nine seconds with kami-shiho-gatame and held it for 30 seconds to win. A few days later, Buyadaa became the first Olympic judoka with a positive doping test, in this case for Dianabol, an anabolic steroid.

After nine races they had five wins, two second, a third, and a fourth. The pair did not start the final two races and still won, the only time this has occurred at the Olympics (through 2012), although in the 1948 Star, the crew could have skipped two races and won, and in the 1952 Finn, Paul Elvstrøm could have skipped the final three races. The Austrian crew was known as specialists in light winds, which was the case for most of their races. Hagara and Steinacher would defend their gold medal at the 2004 Olympics.

Sweden entered a strong team led by the last two World Champions at the distance: Elis Wiklund (1934) and Nils Englund (1935).  In addition they had the silver medalist in 18 km. from Lake Placid, Axel Wikström, who was expected to be the early leader with his start number 4. Finland’s best card was thought to be Klaes Karppinen, winner over 18 km. and silver medalist in the 50 km. at the previous year’s World Championships. Norway had a team without big stars, but had faith in 30-year old Per Samuelshaug, his best performance at the distance being a 3rd place in Holmenkollen in 1935.
The Swedes took an early command in the competition. Elis Wiklund could control his competitors from his late start number 37, and of the others, only Klaes Karppinen was in medal contention in the first part of the race.

Another favorite was Frenchman Yohann Diniz, but he would be disqualified during the race, but not for the usual reasons. Diniz was disqualified for violating Rule 230.9g, “taking refreshment at other than an official aid station.“
That opened the race up a bit and in the end the gold went to Russian Sergey Kirdyapkin, who was a two-time World Champion (2005, 2009) and won by almost a minute over Australia Jared Tallent, who was also second to Schwazer at Beijing. Kirdyapkin took the lead when he surged after 40 km and had a clear lead at 45 km, which Tallent could never close. Tallent was hampered by two cards for lifting and had to be careful near the end to avoid disqualification. Kirdyapkin’s victory atoned somewhat for the poor Russian showing in the 20K walk when only one of their walkers, Andrey Krivov, finished and he placed 37th, although 2011 World Champion Sergey Bakulin placed only sixth in this event. The bronze went to Chinese walker Si Tianfeng, which complemented the gold/bronze won by China in the 20K.
That was how the event and the results seemed to have ended. In 2015, however, the IOC began re-testing samples from the 2008 Beijing and 2012 London Olympics, using newer, more advanced testing techniques, in an effort to find those who had used performance enhancing drugs (PEDs), but in whom it could not be detected at the time of those Olympics. This was one of the many events affected.
All three Russian walkers in this event were disqualified for biological passport offenses. The original gold medalist was Sergey Kirdyapkin, whose disqualification was announced on 20 January 2015. Igor Yerokhin and Sergey Bakulin, who originally finished fifth and sixth, respectively, were also disqualified. The medals in this event were re-assigned to Jared Tallent (AUS / gold), Si Tianfeng (CHN / silver), and Robbie Heffernan (IRL / bronze).
All three Russians were coached by Viktor Chegin, who was infamous for his athletes testing positive for PED usage, which more than 35 of them did between 2005-15. On 17 February 2016, Chegin was banned for life from athletics coaching by the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA).

The 1964 gold medalist Tormod Knutsen had left competitive sport after his Olympic triumph, and 1960 champion Georg Thoma had ended his impressive career by winning gold at the 1966 World Championships in Oslo. The favorites for the 1968 Olympic title were the silver medalist from the 1966 World Championships, Thoma’s 23-year old teammate Franz Keller and the bronze medalist from the same championships, Switzerland’s Alois Kälin. The two rivals had different specialities. Keller was an average cross-country skier, but an excellent ski jumper, while Kälin was an excellent skier, placing 20th in the 1964 Olympic 50 km, where he was also 12th in the Nordic Combination, and he was a regular member of the Swiss 4x10 km relay team. Kälin was one of the few athletes competing in both cross-country and Nordic Combined at an international level.
In the first part of the Nordic Combined event, ski jumping, Keller showed excellent form and won with the longest jump of the day, 77.5 metres, achieved in the second round. His victory could have been clearer if he had not fallen on his third jump, which measured 77 m. An unknown Japanese, Hiroshi Itagaki, placed second and Erwin Fiedor, 14th in the 1964 games, was third. Fiedor was known as a rather mediocre cross-country skier, and Itagaki’s cross-country abilities were unknown. Kälin placed 24th out of 41 competitors and had to beat Keller by almost 3½ minutes in the 15 km cross-country phase, leaving Keller as the undisputed favorite for the gold medal.
In the skiing Kälin had the advantage of starting as number 40, Keller wearing start number 33. The starting time difference between the two was 3:30, almost exactly the time Kälin had to beat Keller to beat him in total points. It turned out to be a most dramatic duel. After 5 km, Kälin had gained 1:03 on his rival, but at the 10 km point he had gained 2:40, and Keller was only 50 seconds ahead of Kälin on the track. Could the Swiss take back 50 more seconds on the last 5 km? He fought gallantly, but in vain, passing the finishing line exactly 6.3 seconds behind Keller! East Germany’s Andreas Kunz secured the bronze medal, advancing from 10th position after the ski jumping after having the third fastest time in the cross-country. Fourth was the Czechoslovakian teenager Tomáš Kučera, and with an Italian in 5th and a Pole in sixth place it was obvious that the Nordic Combined was no longer a Nordic affair. The best Norwegian placed 21st, while the best of the Finns ended in 30th place.
East Germany’s  Ralph Pöhland had placed 4th in the 1966 World Championships and was expected to be one of the heavy favorites. After winning a pre-Olympic competition in Le Brassus, Switzerland in mid-January 1968, he defected to West Germany with the help of Georg Thoma. He was denied a start for West Germany in the Olympics by a decision of the FIS council, after strong political pressure from East Germany and the Soviet Union. A few days after the Olympics he won the West German championships, with Olympic Champion Keller in second place, and at the 1972 Games represented West Germany, placing 10th.

But she could not quiet hang on  for the record, finishing in an Olympic record of 4:07.10, the second fastest women’s 400 ever, less than a second above Wickham’s mark. Three days later Cohen would add another gold by winning the 800 freestyle.

Lesov proved himself a worthy champion by winning the next two editions of the European Championships and would have been amongst the favourites for the 1984 Olympic Games but for the Soviet-led boycott. A bout of hepatitis stalled his career from 1985 onwards but, after the fall of the Berlin Wall had made it possible, he turned professional in 1991.

Final placement was determined by a Majority Placement rule.  Thus, if a pair were ranked first by a majority of the judges, that pair was placed first overall, and the process was repeated for each place.  Ties were broken by a Subsequent Majority rule, i.e., if the pairs were ranked for the same position by the same number of judges, Majority Placement for the next higher position for each pair determined who was ranked higher.

They had won the Worlds in 1965-67, and the European Championships in 1965-68. For the first time at the Olympics, the pairs skated a compulsory program (later termed the short program), followed by free skating. The Protopopovs were dominant, winning both phases easily over their teammates, Tatyana Zhuk and Aleksandr Gorelik. This was the first time two Soviet pairs won medals, but over the next decades, this would become commonplace as the Soviet Union dominated pairs and dance skating. Part of this was due to the woman placing fifth in this event, Tamara Moskvina (with partner Aleksey Mishin), who became the leading Soviet pairs skating coach. Her husband, Igor Moskvin, coached the Protopopovs.
The Protopopovs would compete at the 1969 World and European Championships, placing third and second, respectively, behind a new younger Soviet couple, Irina Rodnina and Aleksey Ulanov. The Protopopovs wished to continue competing, but the Soviet authorities declared that they were too old for international figure skating (he was 36, she 32 in 1968). Eventually they would defect to Switzerland in 1979, and become very popular performers in Western professional ice shows, skating well into their 60s.

Former silver medallist Jack Heaton, 39, was not only an entrant in the field, but also considered one of the favourites, along with Christian Fischbacher of Switzerland, and John Crammond of Britain. Crammond and Heaton lived up to the expectations on the first day, Crammond winning the first run, and Heaton the second. The third was won by a relative newcomer on the Cresta Run, Italian Nino Bibbia. After one day of racing, Crammond led by only two tenths of a second over Heaton and Bibbia, who were tied for second. The home favourite, Fischbacher, had crashed out at the infamous Shuttlecock curve in the first run. On day two, Bibbia moved into the lead with a consistent performance, winning all three runs (tying with Heaton in the 5th and Crammond in the 6th) to become Italy’s first Winter Olympic Champion. Heaton won a second silver medal two decades after his first, while Crammond took the bronze.
Bibbia, who lived in St. Moritz  and had seen the 1928 Winter Olympics there as a young boy, was originally only selected for the Italian bobsleigh teams, and was entered in the skeleton only shortly before the Games. His Olympic victory was his first win on the Cresta Run, but 230 more would follow, including 8 Grand Nationals.

The two heats ended up being the most complex part of the event.
The USA ostensibly won the first heat in 3:11.39 followed by the Dominican Republic but the two teams were soon disqualified for an exchange irregularity. For the US Lynna Irby had lined up in the wrong spot on the first exchange while waiting for Elija Godwin. Both teams protested the DQ and it was upheld as the United States’ case was that Irby had been directed to the wrong spot for the exchange by a track official. For the Dominican Republic the announcement was that “the Dominican Republic athlete
correctly positioned herself in position 2 in response to an incorrect original placement. There was no interference or adverse consequence to any other team as result of the action by the Dominican Republic athlete.”
Belgium, Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands, Poland, and Spain then counter-appealed against the decision to reinstate the two teams. Germany and Spain had the most interest as they would be ninth and tenth in qualifying if both teams were reinstated. Eventually Germany’s appeal was also upheld and the final proceeded with nine teams running.
In the final, all nine teams ran the M/F/F/M order, which had predominated at the Doha Worlds. The leader after the first leg was the Netherlands, as Liemarvin Bonevacia ran 44.8. The Dominican Republic was in fourth place at the first exchange, but Marileidy Paulino ran 48.7 for the fastest female leg of the competition, and handed off first for the third leg.
For the Netherlands, only fourth after the second leg, 400 hurdler Femke Bol ran the third leg and brought them back into the lead, running 49.74. At the bell the Dominican Republic was in second, with Poland third, and the United States fourth. Poland’s Kajetan Duszynski then ran a 44.38 leg to bring Poland home with the gold medal, as the Dominicans won silver, and the USA finished third, the Netherlands fading off the podium into fourth place.

It was reported that way in the press and he was given the bronze medal, but film of the race was reviewed and revealed that Don Finlay (GBR) had actually finished third.

The early lead was taken by Germany’s Andrea Henkel, well-known on the World Cup circuit, but who had never won a medal in a major international.

The wife of France’s biathlon star Raphaël Poirée also missed only one target and came in less than eight seconds behind Henkel. Forsberg started 65th, and posted the third fastest ski time, but her two missed targets brought her home in third place, 39.2 seconds behind Henkel. Henkel’s gold medal was somewhat surprising but over the next six years, she would win four individual World Championships and the 2006-07 World Cup.

This meant Cuba began the second session of finals, as it had the first session, with a gold medal.
In late 2006 Gamboa and two of his team mates defected during a tournament in Venezuela. He based himself in the USA and began a career as a professional which, though 2013, has seen him remain unbeaten and win a world title in the featherweight division.

In theory this should have left Alfredo Duvergel of Cuba with a clear run at the Olympic title but there was a final twist to the story of the light-middleweight division.
The USA had started well in a quest to match previous Olympic performances when the Games were held on its native soil but the semi-final stages had been a disaster and only one American, David Reid, advanced to the final, in this class.  Reid began the final well but Duvergel gradually increased the pressure and, when the fight entered the final round, he held a seemingly unassailable 15-6 lead. The American was then told by his coach Al Mitchell to forget the technical boxing and just go for the knockout. Within 30 seconds Reid landed a chopping right hand punch that landed on Duvergel’s temple and sent him crashing face first onto the canvas. The Cuban attempted to rise but was still groggy and the Bulgarian referee completed the count out. This continued the American run of having won at least one gold medal in boxing at every Games they had attended since 1952.
Reid turned professional after the Games and won a version of the world title in just his 15th pro fight. After two defences he was matched against the legendary Puerto Rican boxer Felix Trinidad in a unification match for the light-middleweight title. He lost the fight via a points decision and also suffered a detached retina during the contest. Reid only had four more contests before continuing worries about his eyesight forced him to retire.  Duvergel rebounded to be World Amateur Championships gold medalist in 1997 whilst quarter-finalist Markus Beyer was a 3-time world champion in the professional ranks.

In 1968 an exhibition of ice dancing was performed shortly before the Closing Ceremony. There were no scores and no competition, but merely an exhibition. Per IOC President Avery Brundage it was called “rhythmic skating,” and he stated that if it was ever to become an Olympic event, it would have to be called “rhythmic pairs.”
Lynn Thomas wrote in the March 1968 issue of Skating magazine, “The demonstration started with several compulsory dances being skated with two couples on the ice. This produced the effect of shadow skating and was very attractive.” The pairs performed a compulsory dance, an original set dance, and a free dance. Ten couples participated with three pairs from Great Britain, two from the Soviet Union, and one each from Canada, West Germany, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, and the United States. One of the British dance teams was the 1966-69 World Championship couple of Diane Towler and Bernard Ford.

His biggest challenger was American Larry Myricks, who would likely have been favored in 1980, but lost his chance at Olympic gold because of the boycott. In the final, Lewis opened with 8.54 (28-0¼), and took only one more jump, which he fouled. He then kept passing, confident that his mark would hold up, which it did easily. But the fans in the Los Angeles Coliseum did not like this, booing Lewis and never warming to him at all during the Olympics. Non-knowledgable fans did not realize that Lewis was saving his legs for the remainder of his competitions. The silver medal went to Australia’s Gary Honey, the 1982 Commonwealth Games champion. He tied at 8.24 (27-0½) with Italy’s Giovanni Evangalisti but won silver because of his best second mark of 8.18 (26-10).

He was highly favored before the first cross country event in the 1968 Games, the 30 km race. But the first intermediate times at 10 km produced some surprises. Franco Nones, a 27-year old Italian skier who had placed 6th at the distance at the 1966 World Championships, had built up a substantial lead, 22 seconds ahead of another surprise, Soviet Union’s Vladimir Voronkov, aged only 23 and originating from the Chuvash Republic in the Volga region. Mäntyranta was in third position another 7 seconds behind Voronkov, closely followed by Norwegian Odd Martinsen and Kalevi Laurila, who was second behind Mäntyranta at the 1966 Worlds.
Over the next 10 km of the race, Mäntyranta made a gallant try to catch the leading Italian, and moved up to second position at 20 km, only 4 seconds behind Nones. Martinsen had advanced to third, but was still over a half minute behind the leader. But Mäntyranta had apparently made his move too early. He faded badly over the last 10 km and lost over a minute to Nones, who secured the first cross country Olympic gold medal for a skier coming from outside the Nordic countries or Soviet Union. Martinsen passed Mäntyranta in the fight for silver, and the defending champion had to settle for the bronze medal. Another fast finishing Italian, Giulio De Florian, bronze medalist at the distance in the World Championships 1962,  advanced from 8th to 5th position during the last stages of the race, finishing only two seconds behind Voronkov in 4th place.
Norwegian Gjermund Eggen, the king of the 1966 World Championships in Oslo with three gold medals, was a great disappointment, placing a modest 34th in what would be his only Olympic appearance. Three weeks after the 1968 Olympics he outclassed his rivals in Falun, Sweden, winning the 30 km race 1:18 ahead of his closest rival.

At 13 km., the runners ran 17 km. on an absolutely straight concrete highway, the Avusrennstrecke, before returning to the forests, to eventually end in the stadium. Six nations, Finland, Great Britain, Japan, Peru, South Africa, and the United States, entered a full complement of three runners. The Japanese team consisted of three Korean runners. After the Russo-Japanese war of 1904-05, Japan had occupied Korea, and forced their athletes to compete under the Japanese flag. They were led by Son Gi-Jeong, who was also required to race under a Japanese version of his name, Kitei Son. Son had run 12 marathons since 1933, winning nine of them, and never placing below third. In Tokyo, on 3 November 1935, he set the world record of 2-26:42, and among his 12 races, he had broken 2-30 seven times.
The race began at 3:00 PM, with the weather dry and clear, but not overly warm (22° C. [72° F.]). Son was never far from the lead and by the midway point, he and Britain’s Ernie Harper had moved into second and third, trailing the defending champion, Juan Carlos Zabala. But Zabala tripped and fell at 28 km. and Harper and Son passed him. He dropped out shortly thereafter. By 33 km. Son had pulled away and he eventually won the race by almost two minutes, Harper winning the silver medal.
Son was a proud Korean. When the Japanese anthem was played at his victory ceremony, he bowed his head and refused to acknowledge it. He told reporters that he was ashamed that he had to run for Japan. The next day, a leading Korean newspaper showed a photo of the victory ceremony, but covered the Japanese rising sun from his uniform singlet. For that, the Japanese jailed several of its employees and closed down the newspaper. Korea did not forget its first Olympic champion. In 1988, when Seoul hosted the Olympic Games, the Olympic torch was brought into the stadium by Son Gi-Jeong, now running proudly under the Korean flag.

The semi-final stage in Beijing was little short of a sensation as firstly Bernard took a huge chunk off the world record then in the second semi Sullivan brought the record down to an almost unbelievable 47.05 seconds. The final did not veer from the expected script and the two men matched each other stroke-for-stroke throughout the race. As the wall approached Bernard had a little more left in the fuel tank than Sullivan and eased away in the last 20 metres to record the victory.

In 1979, LeMond had won the Under-23 World Championships road race, and also won silver and bronze medals on the track at that event, although he was only 18-years-old. He would later become one of the greatest professional cyclists ever, winning the Tour de France in 1986, 1989-90. The favorite in LeMond’s absence was Sergey Sukhoruchenkov (USSR), who had dominated the 1979 season and won the Peace Race, known as the “Tour de France of Eastern Europe.” The home rider did not disappoint. He first rode away on the third lap, but was joined by a group of riders two laps later. The leading pack included two former World Champions, Swiss Gilbert Glaus (1978) and Italian Gianni Giacomini (1979). Sukhoruchenkov broke away again with 32 km. remaining and won by almost three minutes, with fourth place 7:44 in arrears, the largest margin of victory since the event had become a mass start race in 1936.
Far from the leading pack finished Irish rider Stephen Roche, slightly hampered by a knee injury. Seven years later, he would stun the cycling world by winning the World Championship, the Tour de France, and the Giro d’Italia in the same year, a feat only achieved one other time, by cycling legend Eddy Merckx.

They had won the 1966 World Championships decisively, mostly thanks to their opening-leg-man, Odd Martinsen, nicknamed “Stafett-Martin” for his ability to keep high speed and build up a gap to his competitors. In Oslo in 1966 he had built up a decisive lead on the opening leg of 1:08. On a sunny day in Autrans with blistering ski conditions Martinsen did it again. He reached the first exchange 40 seconds ahead of Sweden and Soviet, and leaving co-favorites Finland over one minute behind. The other three skiers on the Norwegian team widened the gap, all having the fastest time on their legs, and the victory margin to runner-up Sweden was 1:40. The struggle for the other medals was most interesting to watch. Sweden and Soviet Union stayed together for the first two legs, leaving Finland over a minute behind. On the third leg, Sweden’s Gunnar Larsson left the Soviet Union’s Valery Tarakanov 40 seconds behind, and Kalevi Laurila had brought Finland into the fight for the bronze medal, reaching the exchange only 26 seconds behind Tarakanov.

The US continued to win gold medals until 1988, when they had to settle for a bronze. Thru that year, all United States’ teams had been chosen from collegiate, amateur players. But the basketball world was changing and other nations were becoming much stronger. As the Olympics were being opened up to professionals, in 1992 the US selected a team of NBA stars. Termed the Dream Team, and led by professional superstars Michael Jordan, Magic Johnson, and Larry Bird, this was likely the greatest basketball team ever. Nobody came close to the Dream Team in Barcelona, and many of the players were so happy simply to be playing against them, that after the games they would ask to pose for photographs with the players. In 1996 and 2000, NBA players again represented the United States and won gold medals, though the margins of victory were shrinking. In 2004, the inevitable happened as American dominance crumbled and the US had to scramble to win a bronze medal. This came after finishing only sixth at the 2002 World Championships, despite using NBA players and having the event played in the United States, at Indianapolis, Indiana.
USA Basketball opted for a new solution for 2008. In 2006 they appointed Mike Krzyzewski, the renowned college coach at Duke University, who had been an assistant coach in 1992 with the Dream Team. Krzyzewski, known as Coach K and for building one of the nation’s best programs at Duke and emphasizing a team concept, committed to a three-year program to set up a similar concept for a US National Team and coach them thru the 2008 Olympics. A graduate of the US Military Academy at West Point, Krzyzewski’s patriotism also made him ideal for the task. Early in 2006, about 30 NBA players were asked to commit to play on the US National Team for three years. Thirty players were necessary because of the risk of injuries, fatigue from the long NBA seasons, and to allow Coach K to select the best players as the Beijing Olympics approached. But first, the US had to qualify for Beijing. At the 2006 World Championships, the US team played better, but still lost in the semi-finals to Greece, having difficulty defending pick-and-rolls, and eventually placed only third. This required them to compete at the Tournament of the Americas in 2007 to qualify for the Olympics, which they did easily.
In Beijing the USA was obviously the best team. Opening against China and Yao Ming in front of the rabid Beijing fans, the US won 101-70. In their last two games of pool play, they defeated Spain, the 2006 World Champion and considered one of their big challengers, 119-82, and then finished off Germany, 106-57. The routs were on and the US Team, termed the Redeem Team by the American media, was evoking memories of 1992. They won the quarter-finals over Australia 116-85, and the semi-finals over Argentina, 101-81. In the final, they again faced Spain, and here the US was brought back to reality. They won the game, 118-107, but it was close. With only two minutes to play, Spain trailed by only four points, when Kobe Bryant stole the ball and canned a three-pointer to open a cushion, as the US pulled away in the last few minutes. The US was led by NBA stars Bryant, LeBron James, and Dwyane Wade. At the medal ceremony, at which coaches do not receive medals, the US team poignantly placed all 12 of their gold medals around Coach K’s neck.

In the fencing segment, the Soviets were competing against Great Britain when something odd was noticed. Boris Onishchenko fought Adrian Parker and his sword registered a hit although he did not appear to have come close to one. In the next match against Jim Fox, the same thing occurred. The British requested that Onishchenko’s sword be inspected and it was found to be rigged so that it could register a hit even when one had not been made. Onishchenko was disqualified which resulted in the elimination of the Soviet team. Onishchenko was taken away from the Olympic Village and was never seen again internationally. The world media gave him one of the most apt nicknames ever – Boris Dis-onishchenko.
With the Soviets eliminated, Czechoslovakia took the lead after the second phase and led thru the swimming. But Great Britain was very strong in the run and they won that phase by a large margin, enough to pull them ahead of the Czechs and into the gold medal. Czechoslovakia won the silver, while Hungary edged out Poland for the bronze. Hungary would been relative easy winners but for a disastrous show jumping section. One of the Hungarians had his round ruined when he failed to tighten the chin strap on his riding hat  and it slipped over his eyes. Great Britain and Czechoslovakia had never before won a medal in modern pentathlon either at the Olympics or the World Championships, although Britain had been fourth at the 1975 World Championships, with Fox winning an individual bronze.

But the Finns and Norwegians slowly began to regain their former strength. In 1951 the Finns fought bravely against the Swedes in Holmenkollen, Paavo Lonkila winning and Eero Kolehmainen finishing third. Norway’s best card seemed to be the 23-year-old Hallgeir Brenden, who won his first national championships 1951 and impressed to win both the 18 km. and 30 km. at the national championship in January 1952, just before the opening of the Oslo Games.
The event was hold under excellent snow conditions, and at the halfway point the Finn Tapio Mäkelä was in the lead, 10 seconds ahead of Lonkila, Brenden and Nils Karlsson, and another 5 seconds down to Norwegian Martin Stokken, and the favorite in Nordic Combined, Heikki Hasu. Stokken, the 19th starter, took an early lead, but a few minutes later Mäkelä finished 49 seconds faster. Spurred on by an enthusiastic home crowd, Brenden finished his race with excellent speed and bettered Mäkelä’s time by 35 seconds. The home crowd then waited nervously for Lonkila and Hasu. The two Finns could not match Brenden’s finishing speed, and it ended with a close battle for the bronze medal, Lonkila finishing four seconds ahead of Hasu. The Swedes had a disappointing day. Karlsson faded to fifth place in the last part of the race, his team-mates placing seventh, ninth, and 13th, far below expectations. Brenden had secured Norway’s first cross country gold since 1928 in only his third real season as a competitive skiier.
Both Stokken and Brenden were also excellent track athletes, Stokken finishing fourth in the 10000 m at the London Games in 1948. He ended his track career after the 1952 Helsinki Olympics having won 19 national titles in long-distance and cross-country running to fully concentrate on cross-country skiing.  Brenden was the first Norwegian to break the 9-minute barrier in the 3000 metre steeplechase and was twice national champion in that event.

His son, Alexander, followed in his equestrian footsteps, but did not ride the bobsleigh. However, Stoffel and his crew fell victim to the dangerous course on the very first run as they crashed out of the competition.
This cleared the way for the other Swiss bob, piloted by Eduard Scherrer. He had won his sled, “Acrobate”, in a raffle, and had taken some of his fellow villagers for some rides.

It was reinstated for 1936, but amateur rules were enforced. Players were not allowed to receive any compensation, including wage compensation paid to their employers. This ruling caused several European countries to withdraw their entries, and most South American teams forfeited as well.
A major surprise occurred in the first round of the tournament, when medal favourite Sweden was eliminated by Japan despite leading 2-0 at half-time. Another Scandinavian team, Norway, caused a surprise by eliminated the home team in the quarter-finals. The match was attended by German chancellor Adolf Hitler, who reportedly left the stadium in anger after the German loss. Norway eventually held on for third place. The most notable match, however, was another quarter- final, Peru v Austria. The match saw Peru come from 0-2 behind to win the match 4-2 after extra time. But the contest was marred by rough play from both sides, and in overtime several Peruvian spectators stormed the field and held the Austrian players.

Kobayashi went on to win Group B, going undefeated although he was pushed in his final match against Turkey’s İlyas Şükrüoğlu, who led, 5-3, with only seconds left in the match but Kobayashi pulled off a last-minute move to win 6-5. He advanced to the final against Bulgarian Ivan Tsonov. Neither wrestler had ever won a medal at the senior international level, but Kobayashi won the gold medal, easily defeating Tsonov, 16-4, on points. The bronze medal went to Soviet Sergey Karamchakov, bronze medalist at the 1987 Worlds.

At the Tokyo Games, it was the second battle between the reigning world champion Lisa Carrington of New Zealand (who also won the 2015 World Championships and the bronze medal at the 2016 Rio Games), and the reigning two-time Olympic champion, Danuta Kozák of Hungary, who finished third at the World Championships, after previously winning this discipline three times. Other medal contenders were Vulha Khudzena of Belarus, world champion in 2017 and silver medallist in 2019, and Emma Jørgensen of Denmark, the Rio silver medallist.
In the semi-finals, both Carrington and Kozák easily won their heats. Jørgensen qualified second behind Linnea Stensils of Sweden, and Tamara Csipes of Hungary won the fourth heat.
The much-anticipated showdown in the final between Carrington and Kozák was over by the halfway stage, with the New Zealander charging out to a big lead with Kozák stuck in a chasing pack. However, it was the other Hungarian, Csipes, who tried valiantly to drag Carrington back to the field and she eventually finished second. Jørgensen picked up the bronze medal and Kozák finished fourth. Carrington added the women’s K-1 500 gold medal to the K-1 200 and the K-2 500 she won two days before, to give her a grand total of six Olympic medals and making her the most successful New Zealand Olympic athlete of all time.
With her three gold medals in Tokyo, she joined the small group of sprint canoeists who had won three gold medals at a single Olympics. She was in the company of the Soviet Vladimir Parfenovich, her compatriot Ian Ferguson, and Kozák.

Another Czech duo, Marek Jiras and Tomáš Máder, the 2000 Olympic bronze medalists, were the 2002 silver and bronze medalists at the European and World Championships respectively. The Hochschorner brothers were the top qualifiers at the 2004 Summer Olympics, with Volf and Štěpánek third behind Great Britain’s Stuart Bowman and Nick Smith. Becker and Henze, meanwhile, were fifth, while Juras and Máder were eighth. Both Juras and Máder and Bowman and Smith were eliminated after the first run in the final, while the Hochschorner brothers again topped the standings and Volf and Štěpánek were third, this time behind France’s Philippe Quemerais and Yann le Pennec. Becker and Henze were fourth after the first round, but won the second round with enough points to earn them the silver medal behind the Slovakians, who were second in this portion of the competition, but had enough points to defend their Olympic title. Volf and Štěpánek’s fourth-placed run was sufficient to keep them in the bronze medal position over Christian Bahmann and Michael Senft of Germany, the latter of whom was a 1996 Olympic bronze medalist. This was the second of the Hochschorner brothers’ three concsecutive gold medals in the C-2 slalom, as they would go on to win the tournament again in 2008.
Silver medalist Stefan Henze was a German canoe coach at the 2016 Rio Olympics. In the early days of the Olympics he was riding in a taxi that was involved in a head-on crash. He sustained significant head injuries and died only a few days later.

Although he did not approach his world record of 482.5 kg, Davis won the gold medal easily, with the best lift in each phase. He was trailed by his teammate Jim Bradford, who was 22.5 kg behind, and Humberto Selvetti, who won Argentina’s first Olympic weightlifting medal.

The effect of high-altitude on athletic performance was known from previous competitions. In sprints and short-distance races, it produced record performances, but at distances, the thin air, with lesser oxygen content, impeded the athletes, and resulted in very slow competitions. No event in 1968 would be more affected by the altitude than the marathon.
The two-time defending champion, Abebe Bikila, was back and since he had grown up in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, at higher altitude than Mexico City, he should have been a favorite. But he was injured, having recently had an appendectomy and was running the race with a stress fracture. He would not finish. But his teammate, Mamo Wolde, had also grown up at that altitude and his track experience, which went back to the 1956 Melbourne Olympics, made him a formidable contender.
The race began at 3 PM on the final day of track & field competition, on a warm (23° C. [73° F.]) and sunny day. The course was point-to-point, starting at the Plaza de la Constitución, known as the Zócala, and ending at the Stadio Olímpico. The pace was slow, the runners worried about the altitude, and thru 10 km., a large group of runners led the field. By 20 km. the lead was held by Belgium’s Gaston Roelants, 1964 gold medalist in the steeplechase, and Britain’s Tim Johnston, followed closely by four runners – Naftali Temu, who a week before had won the 10 km. on the track, Wolde, Jürgen Busch (GDR), and Turkey’s İsmail Akçay. Temu then pulled ahead by 25 km., but Mamo Wolde took the lead at 30 km. He eventually won by over three minutes from Japan’s Kenji Kimihara, making it three straight marathon gold medals for Ethiopia.

In the team event, skaters were awarded points based on their placements. The top finisher in each discipline was awarded 10 points, with second place earning 9 points, third getting 8, and so on. The country with the most points at the end of the third day won the gold medal.
The event took place at the Gangneung Ice Arena over three days between 9-12 February. The short programs and short dance were on 9 and 11 February, and the free skates and free dance on 11 and 12 February, and included 71 athletes from 10 nations.
Canada entered the 2014 Sochi Games treating it like a warm-up dress rehearsal for their individual competitions, and left Russia very disappointed with a silver medal. In 2018, the Canadians changed their tactics, and the team decided they were really going to go after that team gold, and not hold back.
Day 1 included the short programs for the men’s singles and pairs. Canada’s Patrick Chan, had a few stumbles on critical jumps in the men’s  singles and his score of 81.66 points put him in third place behind Japan’s Shoma Uno (103.25) and Israel’s Alexei Bychenko (88.49). American Nathan Chen was in fourth with 80.61 points. Then there was a strong skate later in the day by Canadian pairs team Meagan Duhamel and Eric Radford, who finished second with 9 points, and with Chan’s score of 8 points, the Canadians were in the lead after Day 1 with 17 points.
By the end of Day 2, Canada’s Tessa Virtue and Scott Moir were first in the ice dance short program with a score of 80.51 points giving Canada 10 points. Maia Shibutani and Alex Shibutani of the United States were second with 75.46 points, while Olympic Athletes from Russia Yekaterina Bobrova and Dmitry Solovyov were third with 74.76 points.
The ladies singles was won by Yevgeniya Medvedeva (OAR) with a world record score of 81.60 points. She was followed by 2012 World champion and 2014 Olympic bronze medalist Carolina Kostner of Italy with 75.10 points, and Canadian Kaetlyn Osmond placed third in her short program with 71.38 points.
With Virtue and Moir’s 10 points, Osmond’s 8 points, and pairs skaters Duhamel and Radford’s 10 points from finishing first in the pairs free skate (with one of their best scores of the season, 148.51), Canada topped the standings on Day 2. Canada now had a total of 45 points heading into the final day, ahead of the Olympic Athletes from Russia (39 points) and the United States (36 points).
Entering the third day, Canada subbed in Gabrielle Daleman for Osmond, and her third place performance in the ladies free skate mathematically guaranteed Canada the team gold medal, with Virtue and Moir still to stake in the ice dance. So with virtually no pressure, Virtue and Moir finished first with 118.10 points, 6 points ahead of Americans, The Shib Sibs, Shibutani’s, who captured the bronze medal. A brilliant ladies free skate by European champion Alina Zagitova of OAR, guaranteed her team the silver medal.
Canada won gold with 73 points, well ahead of Olympic Athletes from Russia (66), and the Americans (62). The team gold was Canada’s first in Olympic figure skating since Virtue and Moir won at Vancouver in 2010 and Canada’s first gold medal of the 2018 Olympic Winter Games. Chan became Canada’s first male singles skater to ever win an Olympic gold, while Radford became the first openly gay man to win a gold medal in a Winter Olympics.

It looked as if the leading group of Tscharnke, Finland’s Sami Jauhojärvi and Russia’s Nikita Kryukov would be fighting for the medals, when Jauhojärvi, just ahead of Tscharnke, moved to the inside, colliding with the German, and Tscharnke fell, almost bringing down Kryukov. Jauhojärvi opened up a small lead which he maintained to the end of the race, finishing just under a second ahead of the fast finishing Russian. Tscharnke was unable to recover quickly enough and eventually finished seventh. Finland had to withstand an appeal from Germany before Iivo Niskanen and Jauhojärvi could enjoy their victory. Sweden benefitted from the accident, taking bronze.
In May 2016 WADA (World Anti-Doping Agency) commissioned a report, the McLaren Report, to look into allegations of systematic Russian doping and a cover-up to avoid positives at the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics. The report was released in two parts, in July and December 2016, and confirmed the allegations. In 2017 the IOC formed a commission to investigate this, headed by IOC Member Denis Oswald, and usually referred to as the Oswald Commission. In late October 2017 the Oswald Commission began to release its findings. On 9 November 2017, one of the silver medalists in this event, Russian Maksim Vylegzhanin, was implicated by the Oswald Commission and he and his teammate, Nikita Kryukov were disqualified, losing their silver medal. About 10 days before the PyeongChang Winter Olympics began, the CAS reached a decision, stating that Veglyzhanin’s guilt could not be proven, and he and Kryukov had their medal restored.

Not only were they the reigning Olympic champions, but Russia went into the Games as the defending world champions after they won their first group title since 2007, and three members of that squad, Anastasiya Maksimova, Anastasiya Tatareva and Maria Tolkacheva were in Rio. Bulgaria, the 2014 world champions and 2015 silver medallists, were the biggest challenge to the Russians, and Spain, regarded as the ‘clubs’ experts, came third in the 2015 worlds and were hoping for a repeat in Rio. It was Spain who led the qualifiers by just 0.233 of a point ahead of Russia with Belarus a further 0.083 of a point behind. Spain ranked one in the clubs and hoop, and two in the ribbons while Russian were first in the ribbons but ranked a lowly sixth in the clubs and hoop.
Just as their domination was being challenged Russia put in their best performance to outscore Spain on the clubs and ribbons and rank third in the ribbon to capture a fifth successive gold medal, winning 36.233 points, while Spain and Bulgaria tied second place on 35.766, although the silver medal went to the Spaniards as their execution scores were one tenth of a point better than the Bulgarians. It was Spain’s first rhythmic gymnastics medal since they won the team event at Atlanta in 1996.

Having won the last two of their 36 World titles in 2016 and 2017, they, understandably, came to Korea as the heavy favorites. Canada could rely on an extremely experienced team from the province of Alberta with two-time World Champion Kevin Koe as skip, Marc Kennedy and Ben Hebert (both 2010 gold medalists and two-times World Champions), Brent Laing (three times World Champion) and even replacement Scott Pfeifer decorated with four World Championships.
Everything seemed to be on track, when Canada finished second in the round robin, winning six and losing three games. The three teams that beat Canada, however, were to be their opponents in the medal rounds: Sweden (convincing winners in the round robin with seven wins), the United States and Switzerland (both five wins). The third country with five wins, Great Britain, skipped by the young Kyle Smith, lost their chance after a 5-9 defeat in the tie-breaker against Switzerland. Niklas Edin, Sweden’s skip, was already an Olympic veteran with a fourth place in 2010 and a bronze medal in 2014, plus two World Championship titles and another three podiums.
In the semi-finals, Sweden beat Switzerland 9-3. When Sweden wrote four stones in the fourth end for a 6-1 lead, the game was over. The Swiss skip Peter de Cruz, from Geneva, had collected fewer honors than Niklas Edin, but was, after all, a two-time World Championship bronze medalist. The hard-fought second semi-final saw the United States as 5-3 victors over Canada. The eighth end proved to be decisive when the USA scored two points, the only end in which either team scored more than one.
While Canada’s defeat in the semi may not have come as a complete surprise, they also lost the bronze medal game, beaten 7-5 by Switzerland in a game which saw Canada always playing catch-up after Switzerland gained an early lead. For the first time since curling’s resumption into Olympic program, Canada had to go home without a medal.
In the final, the US team built around skip John “Shoostie” Schuster, defeated the more fancied Swedes 10-7 to crown themselves as Olympic champions for the first time in front of about 3,000 spectators, including the US President’s daughter Ivanka Trump, and Sweden’s King Carl Gustav.
The match was very close up to the seventh end, after which the teams were tied at 5-5. In a disastrous eighth end for Sweden, after a double take-out by Shuster, the US team scored five points. Even though Sweden managed to make up two points in the ninth end, the No.1 ranked team had to settle for silver. Previously, the USA had medaled only once at the Olympic Games (bronze at Torino in 2006) and their last World title dated back to 1976, when it was held in Duluth, Minnesota. Shuster represented his country at the Olympics for the fourth time in 2018, After the 2006 bronze medal, the US finished a disappointing tenth and ninth in the next two Games. After 2014, Shuster formed a team with Tyler George, Matt Hamilton and John Landsteiner, who had previously played together in every World Championship since 2015.

Led by Anspach, the Belgians won this event, although they did lose a match to the Swedes in the semi-final pools.

Because they had both failed to make the final in that event (though Jeon won a bronze through the B Final), they were poised to do better in this competition. In the quarter-finals, Yang appeared in top shape, beating Jeon’s world record with 1:31.991. The two then raced through the second semi-final together, qualifying easily. Both of them had a teammate in the final as well, with Won Hye-Gyeong qualifying for South Korea, and Yang Yang (S) for China. These two initially traded the lead in the final, before their favored compatriots took over. Yang (A) then appeared to grab China’s first ever Winter Olympic gold, leading going into the final curve. But Jeon slipped inside her. Yang tried to hold off the Korean with her arm, but failed and crossed the line in second place. This move even cost her a medal, as the jury disqualified her. Behind Jeon, Yang (S) and Won took home the medals.
The two Yang Yangs actually have different names in Chinese characters, but they are translated to Latin script in the same way. To distinguish them, the letters L and S were initially used, referring to their ages, and not their heights or weights. As Yang Yang (A) objected to the term “large”, she started using an A, which may refer to her birth month of August, as opposed to Yang Yang (S)’s birth month of September.

This left three major contenders at the Games: New Zealand’s Ian Ferguson, the 1983 World runner-up, Lars-Erik Moberg of Sweden, the 1981 and 1982 World bronze medalist, and Romania’s Vasile Dîba who, among many international accolades, had been the 1976 Olympic champion and 1980 bronze medalist.
Dîba earned the opening round’s fastest time as he defeated Ferguson, while Moberg and Yugoslavia’s Milan Janić took the other heats. Ferguson then posted the fastest time in the semi-finals, besting Janić in the process, while Moberg came in second to France’s Bernard Brégeon in other heat and Dîba captured the third. As the crews approached the finish line in the medal round, Ferguson, Moberg, Brégeon, and Dîba were clustered together and finished in that order with less than a second between them. Brégeon would win another Olympic medal, silver, in the K-2 1000, while Ferguson and Moberg’s rivalry would continue into the K-2 500 and the K-4 1000, where the Swede would be runner-up twice more to the New Zealander.

López was thus unseeded in Tokyo, as the first seed went to Turkey’s Rıza Kayaalp, the 2019 World Champion.
After an easy win in the first round, López met Iran’s Amin Mirzazadeh and took him out by technical superiority, winning 8-0 in 4:26. He then faced Kayaalp, who fared better but López still won, taking a 2-0 decision to move to the final. The final matched López against Georgian Iakobi Kajaia, a bronze medallist at the 2019 Worlds, and a European silver medallist in 2019 and 2021, but it was another easy victory for López, defeating Kajaia by a 5-0 decision.
López thus won his fourth consecutive gold medal in super-heavyweight Greco-Roman wrestling, making him only the ninth Olympian to win individual gold medals at four consecutive Olympics, and only the seventh to do so in the same event, joining Ray Ewry (USA-ATH; 1900-08 standing high jump and long jump), Paul Elvstrøm (DEN-SAI; 1948-60 one person dinghy), Al Oerter (USA-ATH; 1956-68 discus throw), Carl Lewis (USA-ATH; 1984-96 long jump), Michael Phelps (USA-SWI; 2004-16 200 m individual medley), and Kaori Icho (JPN-WRE; 2004-16) (Icho’s titles were in slightly different weight classes).

The women’s longest race had been brought forward to the morning to avoid the anticipated cold weather and worst of the wind. In 1:24:54.0, Johaug took her third Beijing gold with a brutal high tempo race and, as a result, won all distance races at these Games. It was also the last Olympic race of her career. At Vancouver in 2010, Johaug had won gold in the relay, and four years later in Sochi won silver over 30 km freestyle, and bronze over the 10 km classical. She was absent at PyeongChang 2018 due to a doping ban. Jessie Diggins from the USA secured second place 1:43.3 behind Johaug in Beijing, while bronze went to Kerttu Niskanen of Finland (+2:33.3).
At minus 14° C, Johaug took the lead right from the start and set an extremely high pace. In addition to Diggins, only the Swede Ebba Andersson and the Frenchwoman Delphine Claudel were able to keep up with her. But one by one Johaug shook off her chasers. Halfway through the race she was 27 seconds ahead of Diggins and 1:15 ahead of Andersson.
After three laps (22.5 km), she had increased her lead over Diggins to more than a minute and left her victory in no doubt. Behind Diggins, Andersson defended her third place until one km from the finish line. Ultimately, a group of five, with Niskanen, Claudel, Jonna Sundling, Tatyana Sorina, and Rosie Brennan closed in on her. They all finished within just over eight seconds of each other, with Niskanen prevailing in the final sprint. An exhausted Andersson fell back to eighth place.
Co-favourite Nataliya Nepryayeva capitulated to the difficult conditions. After having won a full set of medals in relay, skiathlon, and team sprint in Beijing, she dropped out before the end of the first round. At this point, she was already more than 40 seconds behind the leader, her skis didn’t seem to work at all.

The relay was supposed to start in the morning, but it was a very foggy morning in Autrans, and the race had to be postponed until the afternoon.
Aleksandr Tikhonov was clearly the fastest skier on the first leg, and in spite of a penalty lap he brought the Soviet Union into a clear lead, 45 seconds ahead of Sweden.

Her biggest challengers were expected to be the two East Germans, Astrid Strauß, 1986 World Champion and runner-up at the 1987 Europeans to her teammate Anke Möhring, and Australian Julie M. McDonald, who had easily defeated Evans at the 1987 Pan Pacs.
In the final Evans took the lead from the start and by 400 metres had almost three seconds on Strauß, nearly four seconds on Möhring, and almost five on McDonald. The others all negatively-split their races and closed in the second half, but Evans even-split her race and the outcome was never in doubt, as Evans won in 8:20:20. Strauß hung on for second, while McDonald passed Möhring to win the bronze.
Evans would return in 1992 and defend her gold medal in this event, adding a silver in the 400 free. At the 1989 Pan Pacific meet, she swam 8:16.22 for a world record which would last until Becky Adlington’s Olympic gold medal swim of 8:14.10 at the 2008 Olympics. It was the second longest-lasting world record ever, trailing only Dutchwoman Willy den Ouden’s 100 metre freestyle mark of 1:04.6, which lasted from February 1936 until February 1956.
Evans would also compete at the 1996 Olympics but she was by then past her prime and placed sixth in the 800, failing to make the final of the 400. She then retired, or so it seemed, and married in 2004, later having two children. But in 2010 she started competing again, at first in masters’ events, but she then set a goal to try for another Olympic team.

Among his strongest challengers were Aleksandr Ivanov of Russia, the 2010 World Champion, his compatriot Andrey Demanov, the 2011 European Champion, 2008 runner-up, and 2006 and 2009 bronze medalist, Anatolii Cîrîcu of Moldova, the reigning European Champion and runner-up in 2011, and Kim Min-Jae of South Korea, twice Asian Champion (2011 and 2012) and bronze medalist at the 2009 World and 2010 Asian Championships.
The competition in the snatch portion was tight, with Ilyin, Ivanov, and Kim all lifting 185 kg. Kim fell down to seventh after failing to lift 220 kg, and then 221 kg, before Ilyin even made a first attempt. Ilyin came in at 224 kg and lifted it with ease, breaking his own Olympic record for total points with a score of 409. Though six tried, only half were able to match this, starting with Ivanov who lifted the same weight and thus tied Ilyin in points and, having the lower body weight, put himself in the gold medal position. Demanov then managed 225 kg in two attempts, lining himself up for bronze, but he was quickly displaced by Cîrîcu, who lifted 226 kg to tie the score and, as the lighter competitor, knock Demanov off the podium. For his second attempt, Ilyin lifted 228 kg, again breaking his own Olympic record (this time in the clean and jerk) and setting a world record for total points with 413. Neither Cîrîcu nor Ivanov could respond and thus, assured of gold, Ilyin went for a world record clean and jerk lift, succeeding in his attempt and setting the new bar at 233 kg.
That was how the event and the results seemed to have ended. In 2015, however, the IOC began re-testing samples from the 2008 Beijing and 2012 London Olympics, using newer, more advanced testing techniques, in an effort to find those who had used performance enhancing drugs (PEDs), but in whom it could not be detected at the time of those Olympics. This was one of the many events affected.
And in November 2016 this event’s results underwent drastic changes, as it proved to be possibly the “dirtiest” event in Olympic history, maybe rivaled only by the 2012 women’s athletics 1,500 metres. Between 21 November 2016 and 12 January 2017 seven of the top 11 finishers in this event were implicated in PED usage and disqualified. This included all three medalists – Ilya Ilyin, Aleksandr Ivanov, and Anatolii Cîrîcu, but also the 4th Andrey Demanov, 6th (İntiqam Zairov), 7th (Almas Uteshov), and 11th (Norayr Vardanyan) place finishers. The athlete listed 7th, as of October 2019, is Abbas Al-Qaisoum (KSA), who originally finished only 15th.
Iranian Saeid Mohammadpour was moved up to the gold medal and Korean Kim Min-Jae was awarded the silver medal. Such was the carnage in the results of this event, however, that the original ninth-place finisher, Poland’s Tomasz Zielinski, who seemed eligible for the bronze medal, was not originally advanced to a medal, likely because he had a positive pre-Games test for nandrolone just before the 2016 Rio Olympics. His brother, Adrian Zielinski, also tested positive before the 2016 Games and was sent home. Ilyin set a record of sorts, by defending his gold medal disqualification from the 2008 Olympics in the same weight class, which was also announced in November 2016. He became the first Olympian to ever “defend” a gold medal disqualification.

The Germans had developed an outstanding pair in Maxi Herber/Ernst Baier. Baier was a former single skater, coming 5th in the 1932 Olympics. He started training for pairs skating with Maxi in November 1932 when she was 12, and they was able to win a bronze medal in the 1934 World Championships, only 15 months later. They won the European Championships 1935 with Rotter/Szollás not participating. Three weeks before the Olympics 1936, they really impressed by winning a unanimous victory at the European Championships in Berlin, still without the presence of Rotter/Szollás. The excellent figure skating milieu in Vienna had been able to produce a really outstanding young pair in the siblings Ilse and Erik Pausin. At their first international championships, the World in 1935, they came second after Rotter/Szollás, she aged 16 and he only 14. They did not show up for the Europeans in Berlin, but reports from Vienna told that they were making great progress in training.
Emilia Rotter and László Szollás, both Jewish, hoped to crown their career with an Olympic victory in Garmisch. But in front of the home crowd Herber/Baier won convincingly, out of nine judges, seven had them as winners. The Austrian judge voted Pausin/Pausin as first, and the Hungarian judge had Rotter/Szollás in first place. It ended with silver to the Austrians, and the young and fresh couple became favorites of the crowd. The Hungarians ended their career with another Olympic bronze medal.

The race was held under somewhat tougher ice conditions than the previous races, leading to less impressive times. The first to break the 1:09-barrier was Piotr Michalski, who set 1:08.56 in the fourth pair. His time would remain unbeaten for a long time. Outsiders for a medal such as the two-time World Champion and world record holder Pavel Kulizhnikov or up-and-coming 17-year-old talent Jordan Stolz couldn’t break the Pole’s time. Cornelius Kersten was the first to come close, recording 1:08.79, which would be the ninth fastest time of the day and the best British speed skating result in 58 years. Marten Liiv, Ignat Golovatsiuk and Viktor Mushtakov all hit the 1:08, but with six skaters to go, it was still Michalski in the lead.

The favored Dutchman started on a conservative speed, trailing Michalski’s time at the bell, with the Norwegian close pursuit. With the best final lap of the day, Krol raced to 1:07.92, with Lorentzen half a second behind, both beating the leading time. Race 14 had Otterspeer against the local favorite, Ning Zhongyan. Both were still on Krol’s pace at 600 m but faded in the last lap and fell out of medal contention. That left only the final pair. Reigning world champion Verbij saw Canadian Laurent Dubreuil take off at world record pace. At 600 m, the two-time world bronze medalist was so far ahead that at the final crossing, Verbij had to give way, choosing to stand up and glide out the race rather than hindering the Canadian and risking disqualification.
Dubreuil held sufficient speed to finish in 1:08.32, enough for silver, a great relief after missing the podium in the 500 m. With both his father Robert Dubreuil and his mother Ariane Loignon former Olympic speed skaters, he became the first Olympic speed skating medalist with two Olympian parents.

Thus the Olympics and World Championships assumed even greater importance to the female professional riders.

Although only three teams competed, two of them were from a foreign country, Canada, and one of the Canadian teams won the championship.
The events were contested on the infield of the Olympic stadium on July 2 and 7, 1904. There were four teams entered: the Winnipeg Shamrocks of Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada; the St. Louis AAA (Amateur Athletic Association); the Mohawk Indians of Canada; and the Brooklyn Crescents. The Brooklyn Crescents did not appear because of a ruling by the Eastern Lacrosse Association that they had used professional players during games in the spring of 1904, which caused them to be banned from the Olympics. This ban came very late, in June, and the team could not be replaced. It should have been replaced with the St. Paul Lacrosse Club, who was undefeated, and had even tied the Winnipeg Shamrocks that same year.
The Winnipeg Shamrocks were the class of the three teams, easily defeating the St. Louis AAA in the final 8-2.  Lacrosse was contested again at the 1908 Olympics as an official Olympic sport, but has not appeared on the Olympic program since.  However, the 1904 lacrosse tournament is certainly of Olympic caliber, having been contested by amateur athletes of both America and foreign countries with no restrictions placed on them.
Winnipeg was in St. Louis for several weeks and played several other games during their stay, including one against St. Louis AAA on 6 July which they won, 6-1. It is not clear if this should be considered an Olympic match or not.
Until research on the 1904 Olympic Games was published in 1981 (by Mallon), the Mohawk Indian team was unknown, and the Brooklyn Crescents entry was not recorded either.  Some sources list the Mohawk Indian team as actually an Iroquois Indian team, as the Mohawks were one of the six nations of the Six Nations Confederacy of the Iroquois (Haudenosaunee) Native American (First Nations) peoples. They apparently were from the area surrounding Brantford, Ontario, and the discovery of their roster allows us to add the following wonderful Native American names to the list of Olympic medalists:  Black Hawk, Black Eagle, Almighty Voice, Flat Iron, Spotted Tail, Half Moon, Lightfoot, Snake Eater, Red Jacket, Night Hawk, Man Afraid of the Soap, and Rain in Face.
In various other 1904 St. Louis newspapers covering other games they played, we have discovered the English names of all of their players. There were also several other Mohawk players who played on their American tour, whose English names were as follows: Philip Jackson, Thomas Will, L. Bumbary, J. B. Eaver, W. E. Martin (who was actually the coach), and Charlie Johnson.

The USA was well back for silver, finishing in 4:07.90, but that was also almost three seconds ahead of the Canadians, who finished third. The East German victory gave Kristin Otto her fifth gold medal in Seoul. She would later win a sixth in the 50 free.

Interestingly, out of the first six qualified nations from the World Championships, five sent different athletes to the Olympics. 
Although the Russian NOC did not qualify, their athlete, Pavel Eygel, competed, having already earned a quota in the Men’s K-1 event. He finished 18th and last.
Only one former World Champion, the Slovenian Benjamin Savšek, who was also a three-time European champion, participated in the event. Other favourites were the German Sideris Tasiadis, the 2012 European champion and Olympic silver medallist the same year, and local favourite Haneda Takuya, the Rio bronze medallist.
In the preliminary round on the first day of competition, the 2016 silver medallist, Matej Beňuš from Slovakia, led, followed by Savšek and the Briton Adam Burgess. On the second day, only three athletes completed the course without penalties in the semi-finals, including Martin Thomas, who was overall first. In the final, Savšek who had finished only fifth in the semi-final, made an impressive run that eventually earned him the gold medal, the first for his country in this sport. The silver medal went to the Czech Lukáš Rohan, and the bronze to Tasiadis. Rohan was coached by his father, Jiri, a two-time Olympic medallist in C-2 in 1992 and 1996. Savsek’s victory ended the 25-year domination of the Slovakian and French paddlers. The eighth-placed Spaniard Ander Elosegi, and tenth-placed Haneda, were both competing in their fourth Olympics.

In the early rounds, the best fighter appeared to be an unheralded Cuban, José Rodríguez, who won his first two matches in a total of 30 seconds. He again won by ippon in the pool final, this time in 51 seconds over Hungarian Tibor Kincses. Rey came thru the other pool with no major difficulty but without the flair of Rodríguez. The final was somewhat disappointing. Rey countered Rodríguez’s attacking style and won with a koka via a kosoto-gari counter to win the gold medal.

After all, they were still fresh from the team sprint title they had won at the Izu Velodrome a day earlier.
In qualifying, the mark was set early on by Britain’s Jack Carlin, the 2018 World Championship sprint silver medallist, who broke Jason Kenny’s Olympic record with a 9.306. World record holder Nicholas Paul of Trinidad and Tobago posted 9.316 but Carlin managed to hold onto the lead until just four raiders remained to tackle the 3.5 laps of the track, but what big names still had to go. There was the Dutch pair of Lavreysen and Hoogland, the ROC’s Rio bronze medallist Denis Dmitriyev, and the defending champion Jason Kenny.
Hoogland showed his class in setting a new Olympic record 9.215 while the next to go, Lavreysen, equalled his compatriot’s time. Dmitriyev registered 9.331 for fifth place while last to go, Jason Kenny’s 9.510, could only see him qualify in eighth place.
From the 30 starters in qualifying the fastest 24 went through to the first round. One of the most intriguing contests was the race between the reigning champion Kenny and Malaysia’s Azizulhasni Awang, known affectionately as “The Pocket Rocket”, because he did not have the physique typical of a track cyclist but was the bronze medallist behind the two Dutch riders at the 2020 World Championships. Kenny beat Awang to progress to the last 16, however, as did all the fancied riders. It was more of the same in the next round as the favourites all qualified, with the pick of the next races being between Kenny and Dmitriyev.
Kenny lost to Dmitriyev, and with it went the chance of retaining his title and that all-important ninth Olympic medal. Dmitriyev then beat Nicholas Paul to progress to the semi-finals where he was joined by the Netherlands pair Hoogland and Lavreysen. The last four was made up by Britain’s Jack Carlin. The two Dutch riders reached the final while Jack Catlin maintained Great Britain’s record of having won a sprint medal at every Olympic since Beijing 2008 when he beat Denis Dmitriyev over two races to win the bronze medal race.
The all-Dutch final required three races to decide which one of the two riders, Harrie Lavreysen or Jeffrey Hoogland, would take gold. Hoogland won the first race before a close second race saw Lavreysen level it, and in the deciding race, Lavreysen came from behind on the final run-in to the line to snatch victory and became the first Netherlands rider to win Olympic sprint gold since Jacques van Egmond at Los Angeles in 1932. It was also Lavreysen’s second gold of the Tokyo Games after being a member of the winning sprint team.

The only problem with that argument was that the USA would run only one of their 400 metre entrants, that being Tokyo bronze medalist Allyson Felix. To strengthen their squad, they brought in 400 metre hurdle gold and silver medalists Sydney McLaughlin and Dalilah Muhammad, and also added 800 gold medalist Athing Mu. Game over.
Jamaica and the USA were drawn in heat two and even with their second team, none of whom would run in the final, the USA qualified ahead of Jamaica by over a second, with Great Britain well back in third. The three auto-qualifiers from heat one were Poland, Cuba, and Belgium, with the Netherlands and Canada time qualifying from the faster heat two to fill out the final.
McLaughlin led off for the Americans in the final, and handed off to Felix with a slight lead over Poland’s Natalia Kaczmarek. Felix ran 49.4 for her leg, extending the lead to 5 metres at the exchange, as Muhammad took over and turned the race into a rout, running a 48.94 leg to gave Mu about a 15-metre lead for the anchor. Mu then posted the fastest leg of the final, running 48.32, as the USA won by almost four seconds over Poland, with Jamaica close behind for the bronze.
The USA relay gold medalists represented the first time ever at the Olympics or a World Championship that a relay squad contained four individual gold medalists. Both McLaughlin and Mu won their second gold medals of the Tokyo Olympics, while Allyson Felix extended her many Olympic records. She left Tokyo with 11 medals, the most ever by a woman in Olympic athletics, and 7 gold medals, also the most ever.

Other early pace setters were Oksana Khvostenko  of Ukraine starting 3rd (she would eventually finish 8th) and Kazakh Elena Khrustaleva starting 7th who missed none of her targets to finish in a time of 41:13.5. These times were enough for Berger and Khrustaleva the gold and silver medal respectively. Eventually coming through to take the bronze medal was Darya Domracheva of Belarus who finished comfortably in bronze medal position. Berger’s win meant that Norway became the first nation to win 100 gold medals in the Winter Olympics. The fastest skiing time again belonged to Magdalena Neuner but this time the German returned to her more erratic shooting form and missed three targets. Two notable absentees were the Russian pair of multiple world and Olympic medallist Albina Akhatova and 2008 world champion Ekaterina Iourieva. Both were banned for their part in a doping scandal.

Of the four, this is the one about which we know the most, because it was well-described in the 1900 US Report by Albert Spalding, Report of the Director of Sports. Spalding noted, “Kansas City sent its famous engine and hook and ladder company No. 1, the necessary funds, $15,000, having been raised through the personal efforts of the patriotic mayor of that city. The rapid and perfect manner in which this company, under the command of its captain, George C. Hale, performed its maneuvers and thrilling life-saving drills excited the admiration and the repeated and prolonged applause of the great crowds assembled to witness this, one of the most interesting features of the exhibition’s sports.”
Spalding also noted the following report, from the 15 August 1900 issue of La Vie Illustrée, “One of the features of this never-to-be-forgotten day was the passing of the American engine and firemen of Kansas City, whose reputation is universal and whose photographs we are happy to produce here, thanks to the kindness of our American correspondent, Mr. Fitz-Morris.”
The report also mentioned that firefighting crews from England, Germany, Portugal, Spain, Italy, Bohemia, Hungary, Canada, Algeria, France, Russia, Luxembourg, Holland, Romania, and the United States were present, although it may be that this included the crews competing in all four of the events, as we know that Great Britain, Hungary, and Portugal had crews in the volunteer event.
Spalding concluded by noting, “Besides the superiority of the équipe or personnel of the Kansas City brigade, their American engine was also superior, throwing two streams of water at the same time of greater volume and 50 feet farther or higher than its nearest competitor, which only threw one. The horses were styled ‘trick or circus’ horses, especially trained for the occasion, and it was impossible to make people believe that every fire engine, hose carriage, and hook and ladder company in the United States has teams as well or similarly instructed. Kansas City was awarded the grand prix de l’Exposition and excluded from further competitions, as it was preeminently first.”
In addition to the names of the Kansas City firefighters we have found the names of the two horses that pulled their fire engine - Buck and Mack.

In-between was number two ranked Chen Qingchen and Jia Yifan of China, the reigning Asian champions and 2017 world champions.
As with the other events, the group stage went as expected, but led to Chen and Jia facing Fukushima and Hirota in the quarterfinals, which the former won.

It was also used for the windsurfing event at the 2000 and 2004 Olympics. The Mistrals raced on the Alpha course. There were nine races with each sailor having two discards.
The favorite was Greece’s Nikos Kaklamanakis, who was the 1996 World Champion, the 1994 European Champions, and had won the pre-Olympic regatta on the course. In the first eight races, he had four wins and one second, and did not need to start the ninth race to win the gold medal. He did start, but stopped and did not finish. Kaklamanakis later added a silver medal in windsurfing at the 2004 Olympics.
Argentine Carlos Espínola ended up quite close to Kaklamanakis on points when he placed second in the final race, but he could not beat him overall, despite having four second-place finishes and having to count nothing worse than a fourth-place in the second race. This was Espínola’s second Olympics, after finishing 24th in 1992. He repeated as silver medalist in windsurfing in 2000, and then switched to larger boats, winning bronze medals in the Tornado in both 2004 and 2008. His four medals gave him the most medals ever by an Argentine Olympian, although in 2012 it was equalled by female hockey (field) player Lucha Aymar.

Neuland had a good start, breaking the single-handed snatch World Record, but Galimberti won by 20 kg in the military press, setting a new World Record with two other lifters. Galimberti then proceeded to break the clean & jerk record as well with 127.5 kg. Jaan Kikkas duplicated this mark, which put him into third place overall. The quality of the Italian’s lifts can be seen from the fact his total would have put him in second place in the light-heavyweight division, and in 7th in the heavyweight class. Galimberti was the son of Italian immigrants in Argentina, but he returned to Italy, where he worked as a firefighter. He had a long career, and still won an Italian title in 1939.

Losing quarter-finalists plus losers to the winners played for 2nd and 3rd place.",na,"At the 1984 Olympics, the qualifying round matches in the football tournament were spread all over the United States, a situation similar to that which exists in the World Cup tournament. The first time this occurred in international matches was in the 1920 Olympics. While the bulk of the matches were played in Antwerp (although in two different stadia), some early round matches were played in Gent and St. Gilles. From the quarter-finals onward, and including the second- and third-place matches, most of the matches were played in the Beerschot Stadium, the main Olympic Stadium.
Not all the world’s top football nations were present at Antwerp. Germany and Hungary did not compete, as the nations were not invited to the 1920 Olympics because of their role in World War I. Great Britain almost did not compete. In early 1919, England, Ireland, Scotland, and Wales withdrew from FIFA and formed their own federation, the Federation of National Football Association. Surprisingly, the United States protested Britain’s presence in the 1920 football tournament, since Great Britain was no longer a FIFA member. Belgium and France supported this motion, but Great Britain was allowed to compete. Among the original 15 entries, Switzerland withdrew, officially for financial reasons, but in reality the football community in the country was hopelessly split over sporting contacts with Germany. After French speaking Swiss boycotted a friendly match against Germany in June, the Deutschschweizer insisted the nation withdraw from the Games, leaving 14 nations in the field.
In the semi-final between the Czech and French teams, the Dutch referee replaced the Czech linesmen after he was accused of showing bias towards his countrymen and a local official took his place for the last half hour of the game.
The final round match of the 1920 football tournament was contested between Belgium and Czechoslovakia. The referee was supposedly neutral, John Lewis, a Brit. But the Czechs were not pleased with his selection, as according to the Czech player Sedláček, he had been the victim of violence at a match in Praha and wanted revenge on the Czechs. In addition, the crowd of 40,000 was decidedly in favor of the home team. Langenus described the scene, “Both by the side of the stands and by the side of the terraces, waves of people penetrated the stadium, overrunning all obstacles … The Olympic trench had grown into an enormous gate via which thousands poured in. A cordon of soldiers was thrown round the sidelines in an attempt to at least keep the crowd off the playing field. All around the stadium, fans were handing like bunches of grapes from the colonnades and from the trees.”
Belgium took an early lead, scoring at the 6- and 30-minute mark to lead 2-0. The Czechs were becoming very upset over Lewis’s calls. Finally, after a foul was called against Karel Steiner on Robert Coppée at the 39-minute mark, the Czech team left the field, withdrawing in protest of the officiating. They could not be convinced to return to the field and the Belgians were declared the Olympic champions.
The Czechoslovakian team was disqualified and not awarded second place. Their protest was not allowed, the terms of which read as follows (translated from the French):


We were granted an English linesman, which was a contradiction against the published rules, in which it was noted that each participating nation had the right to two linesmen. This rules violation was an important prejudice against us, because the English linesman was not impartial and that is why we demand the annulment of the match.


Most of the decisions by the referee M. Lewis were incorrect and it was evident that he was prejudiced against our team. Also, both of the goals were marked by Belgians only, but after false decisions of the judge, and we demand a rigorous inquiry on this point.


In the course of the match, the Belgian soldiers were introduced as one, and they encircled the field and their provocative and menacing conduct prevented our team from being able to play a peaceful and regulated game. After the regrettable incident at the end of the match, a wild mob of soldiers destroyed our flag at the end in a manner that we were unable to continue to participate until a satisfactory apology for the destruction of our flag was made to the entire team.


The football tournament was to be decided by the Bergvall System, in which teams losing to the champions then contested a new tournament for second place, and then a separate third-place tournament was held among all teams losing to the winners and runners-up. A new tournament was thus begun to determine the second place team. Czechoslovakia had been disqualified in the final, and thus did not compete in the second-place tournament. The second-place tournament began on 30 August, with teams that had lost in early rounds playing off to get into the tournament. The tournament proper began late on 2 September, after the final match “ended“. Many of the French players had already left Antwerp and were not available to play so the French did not field a team in the silver medal play-off tournament. As a losing semi-finalist, France would have been matched against the Netherlands, which lost in the semi-finals to Belgium. The other teams were playing off for the right to face the winner of the France-Netherlands match. When France withdrew, The Netherlands walked over into the second-place finals, where they faced Spain, losing 3-1.
In addition to their gold medals, the Belgian football team was awarded possession of the Challenge Prize that had been donated by The Football Association of England.

They lost all five games, scoring only 9.2 goals per game, while having to deal with an average 31.8 goals against. Their loss against Yugoslavia (9-39), stands out as the most lopsided women’s match in Olympic history, second only to the 44-10 thrashing of Kuwait in the men’s competition in Moscow.
The East German women were favored because they had won the 1978 world title (as well as in 1971 and 1975), but they first faltered in a draw with Yugoslavia (15-15).

In the final he faced the Pole Tadeusz Walasek, who had won silvers at the European Championships in 1957 and 1959, but Crook prevailed by a narrow decision, 3-2. Walasek would return to win the European Championship in 1961, but Crook never fought again at a high level. He joined the military, serving two tours in Vietnam as a command sergeant major. For his service he earned two Purple Hearts, one Silver Star, and one Bronze Star.

This made Johansson the first Olympic wrestler to win gold medals in both freestyle and Greco-Roman. The bronze medal went to Italian Ercole Gallegati, who had a fortunate bye in the third round.
To drop down from freestyle middleweight to Greco welterweight, Johansson spent the two days between tournaments fasting and sweating in sauna, losing 5 kg in the process. Johansson would return in 1936 and win gold as a middleweight in Greco-Roman. Through the end of his international career in 1939 he would win eight more European Championships. Gallegati would wrestle at the 1936, 1948, and 1952 Olympics, winning a bronze medal in middleweight Greco in 1948. Kajander was never heard from again on the international level.

Miner was considered one of the best fighters in the division along with Catterall of South Africa, who was the British Empire Games champion, and Frigyes of Hungary.
The only stoppage of the first series was that of Gabuco of the Phillipines, carried out by the “replacement”  US boxer Ted Kara in the most impressive display of the early rounds. Kara was not to fight for a medal, as he fell victim to the tricky Catterall in the quarter-finals. Oscar Casanovas of Argentina came to notice when he defeated future European champion Polus of Poland with ease in the last eight and he followed this up with another impressive victory against the talented Hungarian Frigyes in the semi-finals. The South African Catterall built upon his reputation with a victory over the home boxer Miner in front of an excited Berlin crowd and guaranteed what was to be South Africa’s only medal of the Games.
The final produced a clash of styles, the Argentine edging to victory with a late flourish, landing a series of hooks on his opponent. Although this continued the run of Argentine boxing victories that had started in 1928, the Argentine team themselves were disappointed with only a single gold medal.
Catterall later became a South African professional champion whilst Miner was a victim of World War II.

She was accused, amongst other charges, of being blind drunk following a party. Holm was still present in the Olympic swimming stadium but only covering the Games for a press agency.
Even if Holm had participated the favourite would still have been the Netherlands’ Rie Mastenbreok, who held the world record. As the competition progressed it was Mastenbroek’s sixteen year old team-mate Nida Senff who proved to be the star performer, she set the fastest times in both heats and semi-finals as Mastenbroek’s more extensive schedule perhaps weighed against her. The final seemed to have been decided when Senff built up an apparently unassailable lead at halfway but she made what appeared to be a disastrous error and failed to touch the wall. Rather than risk disqualification she turned round and went back but dropped from first to sixth. Mastenbroek moved ahead of the pack but she clipped the lane dividers and lost enough time for Senff to close back on her. With twenty metres left Senff edged into the lead and held on to win the championship.

Bearing that in mind it came as a shock to see him qualify only fourth for the final, as Pankratov set out at a pace that put him nearly a second under the world record at 100 metres but faded badly over the home stretch. Scott Goodman of Australia qualified fastest.
Pankratov tempered his enthusiasm in the final and swam a more conservative first half of the race. The Russian had a small lead over the second Australian in the race, Scott Miller, at the 100 metre mark but pulled out further ahead over the closing stages. As Miller, a 100 metres specialist, faded, Goodman and the USA’s Tom Malchow overtook him to pursue a personal dual for second place. Malchow touched out Goodman for silver on the final stroke of the race.
Pankratov’s victory and general dominance was based on his ability to swim half the first length of the pool underwater. This technique was banned shortly after the Olympic Games and swimmers can now be disqualified if they fail to surface within a 15 metre limit.

The Irish did not take kindly to the suggestion, rejecting the proposal at an Emergency Committee Meeting on 21 November 1907, and after Scotland and Wales followed the Irish line, four seperate British teams took part. They were joined by a German team from the Uhlenhorster Hockey Club of Hamburg and a French team made up of players from Club Athletique International, Racing Club de France and the Stade Français.
The first match of the tournament was between Germany and Scotland, who were unable to call on a number of their leading players because of injuries. A last minute inclusion in the Scottish team was Ivan Laing, who opened the scoring against Germany and has the distinction of scoring the first-ever goal in Olympic hockey. But after playing in Scotland’s second Olympic match against England, Laing never represented his country again. Scotland defeated Germany 4-0, France lost to England 10-1 and the following morning the first round losers met in a “friendly” with victory going to the Germans, who scored the only goal of the match. It is possible that this France/Germany match should probably not be considered as part of the Olympic tournament, but we have included it below for reference.
In the semi-finals played that afternoon Ireland beat Wales (3-1) and England enjoyed a comfortable victory over Scotland (6-1). The final was the sixth match to be played on the same pitch within three days and, understandably, the playing surface was not in the best of condition. Accurate passing and related skills became something of a lottery but England was clearly the better team and won, 8-1.
In view of their clear superiority it came as no surprise that England provided the outstanding player of the tournament. Reggie Pridmore individually scored 10 goals in three games, just one short of the combined total of 11 goals scored by all the other five competing nations.
When the England versus Ireland match ended, late in the afternoon of 31 October, the Games of the IVth Olympiad also ended, with virtually no fanfare. The “closing ceremony” had taken place months earlier, on 25 July, at the end of the Stadium events. There is no record of any ceremony on 31 October denoting the closing of the 1908 Olympic Games at the end of the match. However, The Times did note that this marked the end of the Olympics and the final official function of the 1908 Olympic Games came that night with a banquet at the Holborn Restaurant for Olympic officials and any remaining competitors.

Since the last Olympics in Rio, four World Championships had been held with the winners being Gulnaz Gubaydullina (2017), Anastasiya Prakapenka (2018 and 2021), and Volha Silkina (2019). The other medallists from the last Worlds held in June 2021, less than two months before the Games, were Élodie Clouvel (silver) and Michelle Gulyás (bronze). Clouvel was also the only medallist from Rio who competed in Tokyo, while Gulyás was the only medallist from the 2018 Youth Olympic Games to participate. Gulyás was also ranked number one in the world just before the Games, followed by Kate French and Annika Schleu.
Like Rio 2016, the event was contested over two days with the traditional fencing round-robin held on the first day. Schleu gave the best performance with 29 wins, followed by Kim Se-Hui (26) and Natalya Coyle (24). The competition continued on the second day with the swimming and the best time was set by Gubaydullina with 2:07.31, followed by Gulyás (2:07.48) and Clouvel (2:07.51). After the fencing bonus round, Schleu had a comfortable lead with 551 points, Ulyana Batashova was second with 527 and Kim Se-Hui in third with 524. The riding element caused some controversy and changed the results dramatically.
The last starter of group one, Gubaydullina, with her drawn horse Saint Boy, was unable to complete the course because the horse first refused to jump, and later did not move on, which forced her to abandon the competition. The last starter for the show jumping element was the leader Schleu who had to partner the same horse and she had the same problems with Saint Boy, who again refused to jump and did not go on. Schleu was not allowed to change the horse after the problems Gubaydullina had, as Saint Boy “only” refused to jump three times before not going on anymore. Schleu had already problems to start her round and entered the course in tears, as she knew there was little chance to perform well. It later turned out that her trainer, German national coach Kim Raisner, punched the horse with her fist for not co-operating. She was disqualified from the Games and sent home. After the Games she was ordered by the UIPM to attend a “coach education seminar” with a “humane treatment of animals” before returning to any competition. The riding was headed by the two Lithuanians Gintarė Venčkauskaitė and Laura Asadauskaitė who both collected the maximum of 300 points. The standings after the third part saw Batashova in front with 820 points followed by Kim Se-Hui (810 points), Sarolta Kovács (809), Alice Sotero (807), and French (805).
These points were converted into times which produced a bunched field with the following gaps behind Batashova for the laser-run: Kim Se-Hui (+0:10), Kovács (+0:11), Sotero (+0:13), and French (+0:15). French started quickly and took the lead from Batashova after only 400 m. At the third shooting, French was still in the lead with Sotero, Kovács, and Batashova packed together a few seconds behind. At the 2000 m split, French was about 12 seconds in front of Kovács with Sotero and Batashova another three to four seconds behind, followed by Kim Se-Hui (+0:22), Clouvel (+0:25), and Asadauskaitė (+0:26). French was untouchable as she also managed a fine last shooting attempt. Kovács went out second-from-last shooting, and, after a strong running performance, Asadauskaitė, who also had great shootings, followed close behind. French ran home easily and was 15 seconds ahead of Asadauskaitė who overtook Kovács about 600 m from the finishing line. Again, the two Lithuanians Asadauskaitė (11:38.37) and Venčkauskaitė (11:44.37) topped this part as they showed the best combined times.
On the podium were French (aged 30 years 176 days), Asadauskaitė (37 years 159 days), and Kovács (30 years 147 days). All three medallists were older than any other previous female medallist in modern pentathlon.

In both 1985-86 East Germans would fill all three steps of the podium at the World Championships.
In their absence, two American riders came to the fore. Mark Gorski had been the best American sprinter in the late 70s, but he retired in 1981 after several bad crashes. With the Olympics in Los Angeles he returned to the track in 1983 and had actually beaten Sergey Kopylov (URS), 1981-82 World Champion, three times that year. The other top American was Nelson Vails, one of the first black American cyclists to reach international prominence. Vails started riding as a bicycle messenger in New York City. Nicknamed the Cheetah, he had a very fast top-end but had never beaten Gorski. The final came down to the two Americans, and Gorski continued his dominance of Vails in two straight races.

The triple Olympic Champion had won the World Championship in 1929, beating his main rival Karl Schäfer, but since then he had not appeared on the figure skating championship scene. Schäfer had taken over as the world’s leading male figure skater, winning all European titles since 1929 and world titles since 1930.
At the 1932 European Championships in Paris mid-January, he was far ahead of his nearest rivals.
Grafström made a mistake in his specialty, the compulsory figures, and Schäfer won his first Olympic gold with a clear margin. The Swedish stylist was able to recover from his mistake and secured the silver, ending his Olympic career with three gold and one silver, a medal collection even Sonja Henie was unable to match. Montgomery Wilson improved from his modest 13th place in St. Moritz to win Canada’s first ever figure skating Olympic medal, securing the bronze medal. One week later Wilson won the silver medal in the World Championships in Montreal behind Schäfer, but by then Grafström had left for Europe, ending one of the greatest and longest figure skating careers of all time. He had competed in the World Championships first in 1914 in Helsinki, and further international titles were denied him because, from 1915-1921, no figure skating championships were held due to World War I.

The final was held the next day, and three of the Americans, Dixon Boardman, William Moloney, and Harry Lee, declined to compete because of the problems with Sunday competition.
With only three starters, the event was robbed of some of its interest.  Maxie Long had been the favorite, having won the 1898 and 1899 AAU Championship and, only the week before, the 1900 AAA title.  But he had lost the 1900 IC4A title to Yale’s Boardman, so Boardman’s absence essentially handed Long the championship.
Long took the lead at the outset, followed by Bill Holland and Ernst Schultz.  Coming into the final straight, as they exited the tree-bordered section of the track, Long was ahead by three yards and he finished up five in front of Holland, with Schulz a well-spent third.  In a strange set of events, Long was cheered heartily by the French spectators.  He was wearing the blue-and-white colors of his school, Columbia, and the French mistook this for the colors of the Racing Club de France, and thought Long was one of theirs.
Later in 1900, Maxie Long did some outstanding record-breaking over this distance.  On 29 September he ran 440 yards in 47.8 on a one-fifth mile track.  A few days later, on 4 October, he ran the same distance in 47.0 over a straightaway at Guttenberg racetrack in New Jersey.

Fernández Ochoa had no significant international record, his best previous place in a World Cup being sixth. He was not expected to hold the lead thru two runs, with Augert closely behind him. But on the second run, Augert skied poorly, placing only 10th, and eventually dropping to fifth overall. Thoeni came back, posting the fastest time in run two, but it was only enough to get him the silver medal.

Only one woman, Valentina Vezzali of Italy in the foil, had ever performed this feat in the sport. Zagunis had been World Champion in 2009 and 2010 but had fallen at the final hurdle in 2011 where she was beaten by her Russian nemesis Sofiya Velikaya in the gold medal bout.
Unlike many of the fencing events at London, the sabre played out almost exactly to what had been predicted by the seedings with #5 seed Kim Ji-Yeon of Korea being the only fencer to exceed expectations and reach the semi-final stage at the expense of #4 seed Vasiliki Vougiouka of Greece.
The first semi-final was between Zagunis and Kim and appeared to be going the way of all previous Olympic bouts involving Zagunis when the American sprinted into a 12-5 but the Korean was made of strong material and mounted a ferocious comeback to tie things up at all before winning the final two points of the match and ending Zagunis’s undefeated Olympic run stretching back to the Athens Olympics. The other semi-final went on similar lines but this time the comeback by Olha Kharlan of Ukraine against Velikaya faltered at the last and the Russian held her nerve to register the final decisive pair of hits.
In contrast to the semis, the final was less of a contest as Kim of Korea raced to an early lead and Velikaya was unable to peg back the deficit. The final score 15-9 in favour of the Korean. This was Korea’s first gold in fencing in 12 years and the first ever by a woman. Zagunis was unable to gain consolation from the bronze medal match as she fell 15-10 to Kharlan.

Now, Laugher and his new partner Daniel Goodfellow were looking for a repeat success.
At the 2019 World Championships, the British duo finished second to China’s Cao Yuan and Xie Siyi. In Tokyo, Siyi had a new partner, Wang Zongyuan, and they were looking to win back the only diving gold medal China failed to win in Rio. Germany had medal candidates in Lars Rudiger and opening ceremony flagbearer Patrick Hausding, the 2016 individual springboard bronze medallist now in his fourth Olympics.
The Chinese pair were outstanding from the outset of the competition, and after the first dives led by 4.20 points from Japan, with the defending champion Laugher struggling in last place. In the second round the Chinese favourites scored three maximum 10s on their reverse dive as they increased their lead.
The United States overtook Japan into the silver medal position after dive number three and Mike Hixon, silver medalist at Rio, and new partner Andrew Capobianco stayed in second place throughout the rest of the competition. The bronze medal was not decided until the very last dive when Germany’s Hausding and Rudiger edged out the Mexican pair thanks to pulling off a difficult tucked forward 4.5 somersault, and their score of 85.50 won the bronze by 4.59 points. For Hauding, it was his third Olympic medal to go with the springboard individual in Rio and platform synchronised event at Beijing 2008.
Laugher and Goodfellow struggled with each dive and could only finish seventh, 85 points behind the Chinese pair, despite the second highest scoring dive in the final round. Only the ROC (who were joint second after two dives) finished lower than Great Britain as Yevgeny Kuznetsov and Nikita Shleykher recorded the first foul dive at the Olympics since Athina 2004 when China’s Peng Bo and Wang Kenan produced a zero score, also in the springboard synchronised event. Japan’s Ken Terauchi bid farewell to the Olympics after six appearances stretching back to 1996. The 41-year-old and his partner Sho Sakai finished fifth.

At each World meet, she had been tied on total by China’s Mu Shuangshuang, but won on lower bodyweight. Because they could only enter four female lifters in 2008, China elected not to add Mu to the Beijing squad, which left Jang as the overwhelming favorite. She confirmed that by lifting world records in the snatch (140.0 kg) and clean & jerk (186.0 kg) for a world record total of 326.0 kg, and a stunning victory margin of 49 kg over Ukrainian Olha Korobka. Jang continued to compete, winning the 2009 World Championships, and a bronze medal at the 2010 Worlds. She competed at the 2012 Olympics in London, placing fourth with a total of 289.0 kg, fully 37 kg less than she lifted in 2008. Korobka weighed 166.97 kg in Beijing, the heaviest female to ever compete at the Olympics.
That was how the event and the results seemed to have ended. In 2015, however, the IOC began re-testing samples from the 2008 Beijing and 2012 London Olympics, using newer, more advanced testing techniques, in an effort to find those who had used performance enhancing drugs (PEDs), but in whom it could not be detected at the time of those Olympics. This was one of the many events affected. Of note, every women’s weightlifting event from the 2008 Beijing Olympics was affected by positive re-tests for PEDs.
In October 2016 original silver medalist Olha Korobka (UKR) tested positive for turinabol (dehydrochloromethyltestosterone), was disqualified, and lost her silver medal. A few weeks later original bronze medalist Mariya Grabovetskaya of Kazakhstan met a similar fate when her re-test sample was found to contain the cocktail of turinabol (dehydrochloromethyltestosterone), oxandrolone, and stanozolol. Ele Opeloge of Samoa, who initially finished fourth, received the silver medal, while original fifth-place finisher Mariam Usman of Nigeria received the bronze medal.

Greece had won the 2011 world title but the champions were not guaranteed an Olympic title and so they had to make their way to the Games through the official Olympic qualifying tournament. A shock defeat to Spain in the quarter-final meant they would be kicking their heels at home at the time of the London Games. The Dutch team, which had won gold in Beijing, suffered an identical fate at the hands of an Italian team who had been their predecessors as Olympic champions.
Because of the format of the competition the group stage was only useful in determining the draw for the quarter-finals. Spain proved their performance in the qualifying tournament was no flash in the pan by winning their group in London while the other group was won by an impressive Australia team. Australia faltered in the knockout stages and, after surviving a shootout against China, fell in the semi-final to the USA. In contrast Spain continued on their winning ways and dispatched Great Britain and Hungary on their route to a rematch of a 9-9 tie they had with the Americans in the group stage.
Mid-way through the second quarter of the final, with the score tied at 2-2,  Jessica Steffens set up a goal scoring chance for little sister Maggie Steffens which she duly converted. The younger Steffens blazed a trail of destruction on the Spaniards for the rest of the final and finished by scoring 5 of the American team’s goals in an 8-5 victory to ensure a first Olympic title for the US women. The USA had been among the favorites at each Olympics since the introduction of women’s water polo in 2000 but had been losing finalists in both 2000 and 2004 and bronze medalists in 2008. America had won 3 of the last 5 World Championships but ironically their first Olympic gold medal came after a sixth place finish at the 2011 Worlds – their worst performance in over a decade.

Host nation West Germany was to take the gold in a controversial final against Pakistan. The two teams had already met in the preliminary round, with the Germans beating the winners of the inaugural World Championships (held in 1971). Determined to retain their Olympic title, the Pakistani locked down the match. After thirty minutes, they appeared to take the lead, but their goal was disallowed for offside, which was heavily disputed by Pakistan. With only ten minutes on the clock, a penalty corner was awarded to West Germany after a hard foul. Germany’s Peter Trump lost his cool when some of his opponents tried to prevent him from taking the corner. This resulted in Trump being sent off for five minutes. When the shot was finally taken, it was perfectly pushed behind goalie Salim Sherwani by Michael Krause.
Now trailing with few minutes left, the Pakistani players and supporters started to misbehave. The match had to be stopped twice because of onlookers on the pitch, and the players kept on complaining to the referee, even after the final whistle. At the victory ceremony, the Pakistani handled their silver medals with contempt, and refused to face the West German flag when it was raised in honour of the victors. Furthermore, they threatened the doctor that wanted to perform doping tests. This prompted the IOC to exclude all players from the Olympics and ban all eleven players from ever competing in the Olympics. This decision was perceived as harsh in Pakistan, as the US basketball team had refused to accept their silver medals after their controversial final. They had not been banned, although two American 400 meter runners (Matthews and Collett) had been. After a formal apology by the Pakistan Hockey Federation, bans for all but three players were dropped, and eventually all players were cleared in time to compete in Montreal.

The shorter parallel slalom race from Sochi 2014 was dropped to add in the big air to the Olympic programme.
The granddaughter of two-time Olympic medalist ice hockey player Jan Klapáč, snowboarder Ester Ledecká from Czech Republic had long dominated the parallel giant slalom (PGS) world, winning gold at the World Championships in 2015 and 2017. A two-sport athlete, prior to the PGS in PyeongChang, Ledecka competed in alpine skiing’s super-G where she came out of nowhere on borrowed ski’s from Mikaela Shiffrin’s to win an unexpected Olympic title by 0.01 seconds in one of the most insane races in Olympic history. The two-time World snowboarding champion shocked the alpine ski world and with one Olympic gold medal already around her neck, Ledecká was still the odds-on favourite for the parallel giant slalom title in 2018.
Also podium threats were the Sochi 2014 parallel slalom champion Austrian Julia Dujmovits, Sochi bronze medalist Russia’s Alyona Zavarzina, and two strong German World Cup performers Ramona Hofmeister and her teammate Selina Jörg.
The defending medalists from Sochi 2014 were unable to recapture medals this time around. Silver medalist Tomoka Takeuchi from Japan was just edged out by Jörg in the quarter-finals, and gold medalist Patrizia Kummer of Switzerland was unable to advance against eventual winner Ledecká. Austria’s Ina Meschik who was just off the podium in fourth in Sochi, was unable to advance against Hofmeister.
So, a week after winning alpine gold in PyeongChang, Ledecká became the first woman to win Olympic Winter Games golds in different sports in the same Games, only the third athlete to ever accomplish this, the first since 1932, and one of just five in Winter Olympics history to win a gold medal in two separate sports. She simply would have made history by just competing, as no woman had ever competed in both alpine skiing and snowboarding in the same Olympic Winter Games.
Ledecká won the Big Final by 0.46 seconds against Jörg, and Hofmeister won the Small Final by 4.07 seconds against Zavarzina, who seemed to momentarily slip in both races (against Jörg in the semi-final heat and against Hofmeister in the Small Final). The silver medal went to Jörg, and the bronze went to Hofmeister. Zavarzina came in fourth place just off the podium.

However, Gillis Grafström attended none of those Championships, as his work as an architect in Berlin prevented him from taking part.
In spite of a troublesome knee injury, Grafström was in the lead after the compulsory program, and three days later he was also judged as the best free skater. He took his third Olympic figure skating gold, a feat which only Sonia Henie has been able to repeat. Beaten by a scant margin, Böckl withdrew from skating after winning the World Championship later in the season, finishing his skating career with a total of 10 gold medals from World or European Championships, but he had to be content with two Olympic silver medals.

The 2013/2014 World Cup season had seen four Super G races, with Aksel Lund Svindal winning twice (Lake Louise and Val Gardena), while Patrick Küng won in Beaver Creek and Didier Défago in Kitzbühel. Svindal, Olympic Super G champion four years ago, who also won the last two Super G World Cups in 2011/12 and 2012/13, was also in the World Cup lead, followed by Défago, Küng, and the silver medalist from Vancouver in this discipline, Bode Miller. The last two World championships were won by Christof Innerhofer in 2011 and Ted Ligety in 2013.
Of the early starters Peter Fill (ITA) set the target with a time of 1:18.85. Of the more favored skiers, Miller set the pace with a time of 1:18.67. Next to go was Max Franz (AUT), who finished just 0.07 seconds behind Miller. His compatriot Otmar Striedinger, going next, came even closer to Miller’s time, finishing just 0.02 seconds behind. Defending champion Aksel Lund Svindal (NOR) was next to go, but he too fell just short of Miller, by 0.11 seconds. Next down the course was downhill champion Matthias Mayer (AUT), who crashed out. Unfortunately for Miller his luck could not hold as, starting 21st, Kjetil Jansrud (NOR) set the new target with a time of 1:18.40. The next skier down, Jan Hudec (CAN) finished in exactly the same time as Miller, at that stage sharing the silver medal. But a relatively late starter Andrew Weibrecht (USA) came through to set a time of 1:18.44, so relegating Hudec and Miller to bronze medals.
Jansrud, who won his second medal in Sochi after bronze in downhill, was a surprise winner, but he continued the Norwegian tradition in this event, following his compatriots Kjetil André Aamodt who won in 2002 and 2006, and Svindal, who won in 2010. But even more surprising was Weibrecht who after winning a surprising bronze in Vancouver in this event, bettered his performance with silver in Sochi, again going from zero-to-hero as his best World Cup result was still only a 10th place at this time. Hudec won the first Alpine skiing medal for Canada after 20 years, Miller, who had lost his younger brother in the last year, showed his emotions in the finishing area after winning his sixth Olympic medal, which also made him the oldest ever Alpine skiing Olympic medalist.
Skiing manufacturer Head earned a full set of medals with Jansrud, Weibrecht, and Miller, while Hudec used Rossignol. Jansrud won the race with an average speed of 96.57 km/hr by 0.30 seconds or 8.02 metres in front of Weibrecht and 0.53 seconds or 14.12 metres in front of Hudec and Miller.

He was joined by Conseslus Kipruto who led the world list coming to Rio, and had been runner-up at the 2013 and 2015 Worlds. One non-Kenyan given a shot at a medal was American Evan Jager, who had been performing well on the Diamond League circuit over the past two years.
At 1100 metres Kipruto, Kemboi, and Jager had pulled ahead of the field, and would run together most of the way. With two laps left, France’s Mahiedine Mekhissi-Benabbad had moved up from the field and was close to the leading trio. Kipruto and Kemboi moved ahead of Jager at the bell, but Kipruto dropped his teammate on the backstretch, and the duo seemed poised to finish 1-2. Jager, however, ran Kemboi down, passing him on the final barrier, and took the silver medal, with Kemboi seemingly third, and Mekhissi fourth.The French protested Kemboi’s finish, noting that he had stepped off the track exiting a water jump, and the protest was upheld. Kemboi was disqualified and Mekhissi moved up to the bronze medal.

Franklin swam this final only 12 minutes after she left the pool from her 200 freestyle semi-final, in which she placed fourth in her heat. Because of the close time between races she was allowed to cool down in the diving warm-down pool before this final.
Seebohm led out the final, turning 0.14 seconds ahead of world record pace, but Franklin stayed close. She took the lead only a few strokes from the finish and won the gold medal in an American record 58.33, with Seebohm second. Japan’s Aya Terakawa won the bronze in an Asian record 58.83. The final was very close with the top seven finishers within one second of each other, with Franklin’s winning time ranking fourth all-time. This was Franklin’s second medal of the 2012 Olympics, after the 4x100 free relay, but she would eventually win five medals and four gold medals in London.

The podium positions were also identical as Adam Małysz won silver and Gregor Schlierenzauer improved his position in the second round to claim the bronze medal.
Prior to the competition, Austria’s head coach Alexander Pointner accused the Swiss of using curved iron bindings, which were not approved by the International Ski Federation (FIS). According to Pointner, the bindings enabled Ammann to gain a better flight position, thereby improving aerodynamics. The FIS said, however, that Ammann’s bindings were in line with the rules

Somfay fell in the riding, which cost him a better placing. Portugal’s Sebastião Herédia was hampered by a very poor score in the opening phase, riding.

Also not able to compete in Sochi was reigning 2013 World champion Marion Rolland who tore her right ACL during summer training in Chile, and missed the entire season. Bad luck also haunted Tina Weirather when a crash in the last training run left her out of the race with a shin contusion. The four training sessions were dominated by Fenninger, Suter, Gisin, and Hosp respectively, while 2010 silver medalist Julia Mancuso won the downhill part of the Super Combined.
The first skier down, Fabienne Suter (SUI) set a challenging time of 1:41.94, a lead she held until her compatriot Dominique Gisin (SUI), starting eighth, improved on this with 1:41.57. This was followed immediately by Daniela Merighetti (ITA), who finished 0.27 seconds behind, which would eventually leave her in fourth place. Mancuso, apart from the initial stages on the course, was off the pace and finished eighth. Starting 18th, Gut then had a good run, but unfortunately for her was 0.1 seconds behind Gisin. Starting two skiers later with bib number 20, Höfl-Riesch was unable to challenge the top times, placing 13th. Remarkably, starting next, Tina Maze (SLO) who had not had a good season, posted exactly the same time as Gisin, so for the first time ever in an Olympic Alpine skiing event, there was a tie for the gold medal. Maze also won the first ever gold medal at the Winter Olympics for Slovenia. The last racer who was able to come close to the medals was Lotte Sejersted (NOR), who was in third position at the last interval, and finally finished sixth.
Maze and Gisin won the race with an average speed of 96.16 km/hr and 2.67 metres ahead of Gut. A surprise of the event was the performance of 7th-placed Hungarian Edit Miklós from a nation with little tradition in skiing and having a best finish of 12th on the World Cup circuit. This was also the first ever top ten finish for a Hungarian Alpine skier at the Olympics. Seven different nations placed in the top nine with only Switzerland having three athletes in the top five. Five different skiing manufacturers placed in the top six with only Stöckli with two skiiers – Maze in first and Suter in fifth. Gisin won the sole medal at this Games for Dynastar, while Gut won bronze using Rossignol.

He had won silver medals in 1948 and 1952 as a heavyweight, but in freestyle. However, Antonsson lost his third-round match to Germany’s Wilfried Dietrich and his fourth-round match to the unknown Italian, Adelmo Bulgarelli, and was eliminated. Dietrich had seemed to win his first-round match against Soviet wrestler Anatoly Parfyonov, but the Soviets appealed the decision, and it was reversed, giving Parfyonov a split decision. Parfyonov then lost to Antonsson in round two, but he would advance to the final round with a walkover in round three, and a bye in round four. In the first round of the finals, Parfyonov defeated Bulgarelli by decision, which gave the Soviet the gold medal, because of his disputed first-round victory over Dietrich, the other finalist. Dietrich then defeated Bulgarelli by unanimous decision for the silver medal.
Dietrich was competing in his first Olympics, but he would compete in five Olympics (1956-72), and in eight Olympic wrestling tournaments, an Olympic record, competing in both styles in 1960, 1964, and 1972. He would eventually win five Olympic medals, including gold in 1960 freestyle heavyweight, which is an all-time best in Olympic wrestling through 2012. In contrast, this was the only international tournament of Parfyonov’s career.

As both World and Pan-American champion he arrived as probably the biggest certainty for gold in the entire tournament.
As such it came as a massive shock when his Olympic campaign failed to last past the three minute mark of his first contest. Banks was dealing comfortably with Dutch fighter Regilio Tuur when Tuur suddenly exploded a right hook onto his temple. He was knocked spark out and the referee ended the contest without even beginning to count.
The man who gained from Banks’ demise was the Italian Giovanni Parisi. Parisi took the Olympic gold medal with an series of fine displays that culminated when he landed a big left hook on the jaw of Daniel Dumitrescu which separated the Romanian from his senses and led to him being counted out halfway through the first round of the final. Parisi later turned professional and held world titles at both lightweight and light-welterweight during the mid-nineties. Tuur also became a world professional champion.
One of the most unfortunate boxers of the Games was Canadian Jamie Pagendam. He lost his second round fight with the Mongolian Tserendorjiin Amarjargal when the referee stopped the fight when Pagendam was hurt in the final round. The result was then overturned in the Canadian’s favour because the referee had overlooked the fact that Amarjargal had received three standing eight counts in the second round which, by the rules, should have meant Pagendam was awarded the victory. Pagendam was still not allowed to continue.

He had set the world record since 2004 and also won the 2007 World Championships. Liu’s event was highly anticipated by the Chinese, and prior to the Olympics, tickets for the 110 hurdles final were the most coveted in China. But early in 2008, Cuba’s Dayron Robles moved to the fore and had the best record of the year going into Beijing, including a world record of 12.87, set on 12 June in Ostrava, and breaking Liu’s mark. There were rumors that Liu was injured but information did not come out of the secretive Chinese camp, as Liu, with basketballer Yao Ming, was the most popular athlete in China. In heat six of the first round, Liu lined up for the start and started at the gun, only to have a recall for the field false starting. He ran only a few steps but was in obvious discomfort. He turned towards the starting blocks, but kept going out the tunnel and withdrew with an injured foot tendon. The Chinese anguish in the stands was palpable. His withdrawal left the way open for Robles who won easily. In the final, he led at the first hurdle and pulled away to by 0.24 seconds. American’s David Payne and David Oliver came in for the other medals but never challenged Robles.

Canada, meanwhile, sent its entire 1985 World Championship squad, Paul Douma, Doug Hamilton, Mel LaForme, and Robert Mills to Seoul, among whom Hamilton was an 1984 Olympic bronze medalist in the event and Mills had won the same medal in that year’s single sculls tournament. All had been bronze medalists at the 1986 and 1987 World Championships.
The opening heats were won by East Germany, Italy, and Norway. East Germany posted the fastest time, albeit only 0.07 seconds faster than Italy, and brought one of its 1985 World runners-up, Jens Köppen to the 1988 Olympics. Norway, meanwhile, sent its 1987 World silver medal-winning crew, Lars Bjønnes, Rolf Thorsen , Vetle Vinje, and Alf Hansen, the latter of whom was an Olympic champion in the double sculls from 1976. It was the Italians, however, who garnered the most attention in the tournament, first by winning their semi-final heat in Olympic record time, then by claiming gold for a nation that had earned only one previous World Championship medal (bronze in 1983) by a margin of over 1½ seconds in the final. Norway, meanwhile, settled for silver while East Germany beat out the Soviets by over a second to capture bronze.

19-year old Cleveland native Carmen Barth’s bout with the Mexican middleweight Manuel Cruz ended with Cruz having the unfortunate distinction of being the only victim of a clean knockout at the LA Olympics. Whilst reports agree that the American was untroubled in winning his first two bouts needed to take the gold medal, reports of the final vary. American newspapers described him as “drumming a victory tattoo on the body of his Argentine opponent”. Other reports claim that, though boxing wildly, Amado Azar was still better than his more precise American opponent. The Argentinean was so upset when he wasn’t given the fight that he immediately left the ring and did not stay for the customary picture with the winner.
Roger Michelot of France lost in the last eight but returned four years later to take light-heavyweight gold in Berlin. Tragically, New Zealand representative Bert Lowe was long dead by then, a victim of a brain injury suffered in only his fourth professional fight.

The ninth team was Russia which never withdrew and actually tried to compete.  In 1908, as today, most nations in the world used the Gregorian Calendar, but unlike today, a few nations used the older Julian Calendar.  Russia was one of the nations using the Julian Calendar, which differed by 13 days from the Gregorian Calendar.  The Russian shooters, thinking that The International team match was to begin on 10 July in the Julian Calendar, arrived shortly before that date, which equated to 23 July by the Gregorian Calendar.  Unfortunately, they found that The International team match had been completed and all the shooters had by now left Bisley.
This was a very closely fought contest on the first day with the United States team holding a narrow lead over the British team - 1,291 to 1,281.  But on the second day, the U.S. shooters continued to post marginally better scores than the British and won by 34 points.  The weather was terrible on both days, but especially so on the second with wind varying from 12-20 mph (5.3-8.9 mps), low cloud cover and rain flurries off and on all day.
