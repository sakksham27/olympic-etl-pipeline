2224,"Individual, Men",1960 Winter Olympics,36,Nordic Combined,/editions/36/sports/NCB,21 – 22 February 1960,"Olympic Jumping Hill, Squaw Valley, California / McKinney Creek Stadium, Tahoma, California",33 from 13 countries,Normal hill ski jumping and 15 kilometres skiing; placements determined by points table.,na,"Defending Olympic Champion Sverre Stenersen had shown consistency after 1956, taking the silver medal at the 1958 World Championships and winning at Holmenkollen in 1959. His teammate, Tormod Knutsen, younger by five years but the National Champion in 1959-60 and winner at Holmenkollen in 1958, was considered as Norway’s gold favorite for the 1960 Olympics. Finland’s 1958 World Champion, Paavo Korhonen, was an excellent cross-country skier, but his jumping was very variable and he was depending on two good jumps to be able to fight for the medals.
The Nordic Combination started with the ski jumping event as in the last two Winter Olympic Games. Georg Thoma, a 22-year-old from Hinterzarten in West Germany, won the jumping event ahead of Soviet Union’s Dmitry Kochkin and the Japanese Yosuke Eto, but all three were considered too weak in the cross-country event to contend for the gold medal. Thoma had recently won the West-German championships in ski jumping. Tormod Knutsen, lying fourth after the jumping event, was considered as the main favorite for the gold. World Champion Paavo Korhonen, placing only a modest 24th, seemed out of contention.
The cross-country race on the next day produced some surprising results. George Thoma skied well and produced the fourth fastest time of the day, holding off Tormod Knutsen and won the gold medal with a clear margin over his Norwegian opponent. Nikolay Gusakov of the Soviet Union, a 25-year old Karelian married to 10 km Olympic Champion Mariya Gusakova, was the fastest skier of the day and advanced from tenth place in the jumping event into bronze medal position. Pekka Ristola from Finland placed sixth in both events and advanced to fourth place, ahead of Kochkin, who produced a decent cross-country race but could not defend his silver position from the jumping event.
Georg Thoma, after his breakthrough at the 1960 Olympics, emerged as one of the greatest all-time athletes in Nordic Combined. He won the Holmenkollen event in 1963, 1964 and 1965, and crowned his skiing career as World Champion in the same arena in 1966. He won another Olympic medal by placing third at the 1964 Games in Innsbruck.

306000,"Beach Volleyball, Women",2012 Summer Olympics,54,Beach Volleyball,/editions/54/sports/VBV,28 July –  8 August 2012,"Horse Guards Parade, Centre Court, London",48 from 17 countries,Top 16 teams from round-robin pools advanced to the single-elimination tournament.,na,"London mayor Boris Johnson was able to watch some early rounds of beach volleyball and memorably wrote of the women’s tournament, “As I write these words there are semi-naked women playing beach volleyball in the middle of the Horse Guards Parade immortalised by Canaletto. They are glistening like wet otters.” It was a demeaning description as the event featured one of the most dominant athletic pairs in Olympic history, Americans Kerri Walsh and Misty May-Treanor. Walsh and May-Treanor came in as the two-time defending champions, never having lost a set at the Olympics. But after Beijing they had backed off from the sport a bit, getting married, having babies, and May-Treanor competed on the American television show, “Dancing With the Stars,” before she tore her Achilles’ tendon in the process. But the two came back in 2011 and won the World Championships, and although only seeded third, behind Brazil’s Larissa and Juliana and China’s Xue Chen and Zhang Xi, they were expected to be formidable.
They were. But in pool play they looked vulnerable after losing their first Olympic set to Austria’s sister pairing of Doris and Stefanie Schwaiger. They still advanced to the final, by defeating Xue and Zhang in the semis. In the other semi, Americans Jennifer Kessy and April Ross shocked Larissa and Juliana to create an all-USA final. The final was a comfortable victory for Walsh and May-Treanor, winning in straight sets, 21-16, 21-16. Their third consecutive gold medal made them only the second team in Olympic victory to win three straight gold medals with identical team members, after Pavol and Peter Hochschorner in Canadian canoe slalom doubles in 2000-08. Third place went to Brazil who defeated China 2-1 in the bronze medal match.

They won the third and fourth races to move into the lead, and were able to win the gold medal without having to sail in the 11th race. This gave Grael his second gold medal, but his fifth Olympic medal overall, an Olympic record for sailing at the time, although in 2012 it was equalled by Britain’s Ben Ainslie and Grael’s countryman Robert Scheidt. Silver medal skipper Ross MacDonald placed second in the final race to move ahead of France for second place. MacDonald had won a bronze in the Star at the 1992 Olympics. Of the 16 boats in the event, seven had won World Sailing Championships in various classes.

The more dominant competitor of late was American-born Chinese skier Eileen Gu, who had won the event at the 2020 Winter Youth Olympics, the 2021 World Championships, and all four times it had been held in the most recent World Cup season.
As expected, Gu dominated the field in qualifying, recording the highest score of the tournament and the only one above 90 in the first round. With 89.50, however, Rachael Karker of Canada, the 2021 World runner-up, came close. Estonia’s Kelly Sildaru, the 2019 World Champion who was more of a slopestyle specialist, was third, while Sharpe was further down the list in sixth.
Gu never relinquished the lead, with the highest score in the first two rounds of the final, either of which would have won her the gold medal. When Gu took a victory lap for the third round, Sharpe came out on top with her best performance of the tournament, although her score in any of the three runs would have assured her second place. Karker, meanwhile, edged out Sildaru by 0.75 points to claim bronze. Gu’s win, combined with her earlier victory in big air and her silver in slopestyle, made her the first freestyle skier to claim three medals in a single edition of the Olympics.

Hungary’s György Kozmann and György Kolonics, the 2004 Olympic bronze medalists, had been the 2006 World Champions, the 2005 and 2007 European runners-up, and the 2005 World bronze medalists, but Kolonics died of heart failure shortly prior to the 2008 Summer Olympics and was replaced by Tamás Kiss. Belarusian brothers Andrey and Aleksandr Bogdanovich, meanwhile, were the 2008 European champions and the 2006 and 2007 bronze medalists.
The Germans and the Belarusians won their opening heats and advanced directly to the final, while the Hungarians were fourth in the German heat and were relegated to the semi-finals. Here they were defeated by Poland’s Wojciech Tyszyński and Paweł Baraszkiewicz, the 2007 World and 2008 European bronze medalists. The final was a tight race between the Germans and the Belarusians, both of whom were almost four seconds ahead of the rest of the pack as they crossed the finish line, with the Bogdanovich brothers capturing gold by a margin of only 0.223 seconds. Hungary, meanwhile, was engaged in a three-way battle for bronze with the Romania and Chinese teams, which it won by a mere 0.084 seconds. Gille and Wylenzek would go on to earn bronze in the C-2 500 the following day.

For some time disqualifying the German team was discussed by the officials. The tragic figure was first leg runner Franziska Preuß, who hit all five targets in her first round of shooting, but thought she had missed a shot. She reloaded a cartridge, but did not shoot when she noticed her miscalculation. The jury did not disqualify her, but at the second shooting she then missed four targets and had to run a penalty loop.
The event ended up being very close, with only 64 seconds separating gold medal winning Belarus from ninth-placed Italy. Belarus never led until the final leg, when their anchor skier Darya Domracheva pulled ahead of France’s Anaïs Bescond and won the event by 10.7 seconds over Sweden, led by their anchor Hanna Öberg, who pulled them from eighth place after three legs with the fastest leg of the entire relay, marked by perfect shooting. Bescond and France held on for the bronze medal, with Norway finishing fourth. Italy had been third after three legs, but Federica Sanfilippo struggled both skiing and shooting as they dropped back to ninth.
Domracheva won her fourth gold medal, after three in Sochi, and replaced Germany’s Kati Wilhelm and Slovkaia’s Anastasia Kuzmina, both with three golds, as the most successful female biathletes in Olympic history in terms of gold medals. Wilhelm was the color commentator for this race on German TV.

It was an individual variant of the military ski patrol competition, an official medal sport in 1924, and organized as a demonstration sport on several earlier Olympic occasions. The first World Championships were organized in Saalfelden, Austria in 1958 with Adolf Wiklund from Sweden as the first champion. One year later the Soviets took a double in Courmayeur, Italy, with Vladimir Melanin as winner and Dmitry Sokolov in second place.
The Olympic biathlon competition in 1960 was contested over 20 km with 20 shots fired over four different ranges: 200m, 250m, 150m and 100m. The first three series were fired from a prone position, the last standing. Each missed target gave a two minute penalty, which was added to the final time. In 1967 the penalty for each missed target was reduced from two to one minute. Also the weapon was different from the small board rifle in use nowadays. The biathletes at that time used a high-power center fire rifle, normally caliber 7,62 mm. The normal start interval in those days was two minutes, but due to very mild temperatures the intervals were reduced to one minute for the first Olympic event.
Before the final five standing shots, only three participants had been able to hit all 15 targets, and those three held the medal positions. Aleksandr Privalov from the Soviet Union had a lead of over two minutes on the Swede Klas Lestander, and the Norwegian 38-year-old veteran Henry Hermansen followed closely in third place. But the final standing shooting turned out to be decisive. Lestander once again made 5 hits, the only competitor to hit all 20 targets, and would finish as Olympic champion, even if his cross country time was the 15th best of the day out of 30 competitors. Privalov missed three times, was penalized with six minutes, and was also passed in the final stage by the Finn Antti Tyrväinen, who had two missed targets on the first two shooting phases, but was able to hit his last 10 targets. For Hermansen, the final shooting phase was even worse -  he missed four shots and went down to 10th place overall.
The fastest skier of the day, the French cross country specialist Victor Arbez, had a cross-country time almost 7 1/2 minutes better than the Olympic Champion Lestander, but was only able to hit 2 of his 20 targets. He was penalized 36 minutes and ended up placing 25th out of the 30 competitors.
The Olympic Champion Klas Lestander was 28, and came from the little village Arjeplog in the Lapland area in the far north of Sweden. He ended his athletic career after being a member of the Swedish relay team that placed third at the 1961 World Biathlon Championships. At that time, the relay event was not an official championships event.

She was followed by Croatian Janica Kostelić, defending champion in the event who had won three gold medals at the 2002 Winter Olympics. But in the downhill, Kostelić posted the best time to defend her gold medal in the event, and win her fourth Olympic gold medal. It was not a surprise as Kostelić had been World Cup champion and World Champion in 2003 and 2005. Schild was seventh in the downhill but held on for the silver medal, with the bronze going to Sweden’s Anja Pärson, who was fourth in the slalom and second in the downhill.

The teams were selected as follows: host nation (United States), World Cup (Cuba, Brazil, China), Continental Qualifiers (Korea, Canada, Germany, Peru), and qualifying tournaments (Russia, Japan, Netherlands, Ukraine)
Cuba was easily the best team in the world. They had won the 1992 Olympic gold medal and the 1994 World Championships, and every other tournament they entered in the interim. But they were fortunate to get out of group play, losing two matches, and finishing only third in Group B behind Brazil and Russia. In the quarter-finals they were drawn against their arch-rival, the United States, and crushed them – 1, 10, and 12. The semi-finals saw Cuba play Brazil, who had defeated them very easily in straight sets in their group. This match was much closer, going five sets, with Cuba winning 15-12 in the fifth. In the final, Cuba faced China, World Champions in 1982 and 1986. China’s female volleyball fortunes had fallen off considerably since then, but they had replaced their coach with former star player Lang Ping. This seemed to be the boost they needed and they reached the final undefeated. China won the first set of the final, 16-14, but Cuba came back to win the next three sets and the gold medal. The medal ceremony was tainted by booing and whistling from the American crowd when Cuba was awarded their gold medals.

Kottysch avoided the favourites in the early stages and watched as the top rated fighters began to eliminate each other from contention. Valery Tregubov of the USSR eliminated American Reggie Jones but was himself beaten by the young Briton Alan Minter whilst in the other half of the draw 1968 silver medalist Rolando Garbey fell to Wiesław Rudkowski of Poland. The semi-final between Kottysch and Minter proved to be one of the most contentious of the Games. Kottysch won the slenderest of decisions as two judges voted for him, two for Kottysch and the fifth judge had the fight even at 59-59 but gave the advantage to the German. The result received a mixed reception even within the pro-German crowd. Kottysch and Rudkowski, two old rivals, met for the gold medal with the German’s harder punching triumphing over the more skillful Pole. Rudkowski was also hampered by a cut eye during the final round. After the medal ceremony Kottysch announced that this fight was to be last. Bronze medalist Minter went on to a successful professional career which culminated with a spell as the middleweight champion of the world.

Amongst those favoured to make an impression in Melbourne were two European champions, the 1955 gold medallist Edgar Basel of Germany and Henryk Kukier who had won gold for Poland in 1953. Vladimir Stolnikov of the USSR and Mircea Dobrescu of Romania were also considered as medal contenders. With 19 boxers entered only three first round fights were needed but the luck of the draw pitted Stolnikov and Basel together and the German, who had reached the Olympic final in 1952, was eliminated by the Soviet. Stolnikov’s run was surprisingly ended by the teenaged Briton, Terry Spinks. Spinks was a late addition to the British team having originally been left out due to his youth and a perceived lack of experience. A press campaign orchestrated by the journalist Reg Gutteridge had helped change the selectors’ minds. The Londoner proved a revelation as he used his lightning hand speed to pepper his rivals with a succession of quick fire punches and he comfortably outpointed  Dobrescu in the final to become the first British fighter to win an Olympic title since 1924.
Ironically Spinks’ Olympic success may have adversely affected his professional career. He was matched against older and more experienced opponents from early in the career and, although he did become British champion, he walked away from the sport at the age of just 24 after a series of hard fights.  More successful as professionals were Irish bronze medallist Johnny Caldwell and Italy’s Salvatore Burruni and both became world champions.

For the time he was a massive 6-6¾ (2.00), weighing up to 285 lbs. (130 kg.).  Rose was AAU shot put champion in 1907-1910 and had won the Olympic shot put gold medal at St. Louis in 1904.  In his career, he set eight world records, ending with the first IAAF-recognized mark of 51-0 (15.54), set in San Francisco on 21 August 1909.  Prior to Rose, the top putter in the world had been the Irishman, Denis Horgan.  Born in Banteer, County Cork, Horgan’s career would see him win 13 British AAA shot put crowns - 1893-1899, 1904-05, 1908-10, and 1912.  He was also AAU champion in 1900.  He also won 17 Irish titles with the shot and 11 in other weight-throwing events.  Horgan would possibly have won the shot put gold medal in the Olympics of 1900, 1904, and 1906 but he did not compete at those Olympics.
At London in 1908, Rose and Horgan competed against each other for the only known time, but Rose had little difficulty in turning back the aging Horgan’s challenge.  Surprisingly, Rose did not approach his Olympic record of 48-7¼ (14.81) from St. Louis in 1904, or his world record of 49-7¼ (15.12).  In an exhibition throw after the competition had entered, he recorded 47-2.  Interestingly, no toe board was used in shot putting.

America’s best hope, Morgan Uceny, world ranked #1 in 2011, was running near the back of the pack at that point, only to lock legs with another runner and fall to the track. The same fate had befallen her at the 2011 World Championships, and she pounded her fists on the London track in frustration. Ahead of her the lead at three laps was taken by Gamze Bulut of Turkey. But she was soon passed by her teammate, Aslı Çakır. The two Turks were trailed by Ethiopia’s Abeba Aregawi and Bahrain’s Maryam Jamal. The homestretch was a mad sprint, due to the slow pace, but Çakır held on for gold, with Bulut coming up from fourth 50 metres from the line to win silver, and Jamal filling out the podium.
Alptekin had previously been suspended for doping, after a positive test at the 2004 World Junior Championships, but returned in 2006. Jamal was born Zenebech Tola in Ethiopia but in 2004 she and her husband sought political asylum in Switzerland. She was eventually granted citizenship in Bahrain which asked that she run for them and adopt a Muslim name. She was the 2007 and 2009 World Champion.
A few months after the Games, Çakır was sued by Turkish runner, Süreyya Ayhan who alleged that she deserved a share of the riches Çakır received for winning the gold medal. Ayhan Kop claimed there was a contract between the two granting her a share of the rewards if Çakır won an Olympic medal.
That was how the event and the results seemed to have ended. In 2015, however, the IOC began re-testing samples from the 2008 Beijing and 2012 London Olympics, using newer, more advanced testing techniques, in an effort to find those who had used performance enhancing drugs (PEDs), but in whom it could not be detected at the time of those Olympics. This was one of the many events affected.
After the re-testing, this was revealed to be the dirtiest known athletics event in Olympic history, surpassed only by the 2012 men’s weightlifting 94 kg class. The original 1,500 m gold medalist, Turkey’s Aslı Çakır, and her teammate, silver medalist Gamze Bulut, were disqualified for biological passport offenses, Çakır in August 2015 and Bulut in March 2017. The medals were eventually upgraded to the next placed finishers, Tatyana Tomashova and Abeba Aregawi.
Two other finalists, Belarussian Nataliya Koreyvo, who placed seventh, and Russian Yekaterina Kostetskaya, originally ninth, were also disqualified for biological passport offenses. Three runners who competed in the heats only – Yekaterina Martynova (RUS), Hanna Mishchenko and Anzhelika Shevchenko, both of Ukraine – all fell afoul of the biological passport rule.
In 2017 Aslı Çakır was nabbed for another PED offense. This was her third positive doping test, as in September 2004 she had been caught at the World Junior Championships. After the 2017 positive test, Çakır was banned for life from athletics.

Coe came to the fore in the summer of 1979 when he broke the world records for 800 metres, 1,500 metres, and the mile. At the Dubai Golden Mile on 17 July, he ran 3:48.95 to break John Walker’s mile record. A few weeks later, at the Weltklasse Meet in Zürich, he ran 3:32.03 to better Filbert Bayi’s record for 1,500 metres. But Ovett had been ranked #1 in the world in 1977-78 and he fought back, posting times of 3:49.57 and 3:32.11. Then on 21 May 1980, at the Crystal Palace in London, Ovett broke Coe’s world mile record, running 3:48.8. And in early June, at Bislett Stadium in Oslo, he ran 3:32.09 for 1,500 metres. In that era both his mark and Coe’s world record of 3:32.03 were rounded up to 3:32.1 and Ovett had another world record.
The Moskva Olympics were sorely affected by the American-led boycott, and two runners who were missed were John Walker, the defending champion, and American Steve Scott. But the British Olympic Association defied their government and Great Britain entered a team, allowing both Coe and Ovett to compete. Earlier in the Olympics, they both ran the 800, where Coe was considered the stronger runner because of his greater speed. But Ovett won that race in a slight upset, Coe getting the silver medal. In the 1,500 final, the pace was absurdly slow, passing 800 in 2:04.9. The East German Jürgen Straub then began a sustained kick, trying to draw out the field. It played into Coe’s hands, who could maintain high speed longer than anyone. He pulled up to Straub on the final curve and passed him at the start of the homestretch, holding him off in the straight, with Ovett finishing third.

However, by the time of the PyeongChang Games, the twenty-three-year-old German had established herself as the firm favourite for Olympic gold after a season where she had won four of the eight World Cup races to secure the overall title. She was also the World Champion from her victory on home ice at the Königssee track in 2017.
Based on results from the 2017-18 season Lölling’s strongest rivals should have been Janine Flock from Austria and Russia’s Yelena Nikitina, both of whom had two World Cup victories to their name.  A second German, Tina Hermann, and Canada’s Elisabeth Vathje were also predicted to challenge for medals as both has been regular visitors to World Cup podiums in recent races.
Nikitina had raced through the season with the possibility that she would not make PyeongChang at all. On 22 November 2017, Nikitina was disqualified from the 2014 Games, lost her Olympic bronze medal and was given a lifetime ban from Olympic competition for her part in the doping scandal that engulfed the Sochi Games only to be allowed to continue her season as she waited for her appeal to be processed.
A week before the PyeongChang Games were due to begin the Court of Arbitration for Sport overturned this decision and returned her Olympic bronze to her, citing a lack of evidence against her as an individual.  CAS also removed Nikitina’s ban only for her to be refused a chance to compete as she didn’t comply with the regulations needed to perform as an “Olympic Athlete from Russia”.
The surprise of the official training runs on the Olympic track was the performance of the British pair of Yarnold and Laura Deas. They consistently appeared at the top of the timesheets despite both having had an erratic season with just as many poor performances as good. There were whispers about the legality of certain aerodynamic qualities on their new bodysuits, but the FIBT ruled them suitable for competition amongst rumours that British team management may have manufactured the controversy as a psychological distraction to other teams.
Yarnold took up from where she had left off in Sochi by posting the fastest time of the first run, but a sloppy second effort dropped her behind Flock and Lölling at the end of the first day. Flock retained the lead after the third run, but the field tightened noticeably with only a third of a second separating the top six and only a tenth between Flock, Yarnold and Lölling who were now placed in that order.
With just the final three to complete their runs Laura Deas led the competition. Lölling made her customary slow start but gained momentum as she slid down the mountain and did enough to take the lead away from Deas. Up next, Yarnold nailed her final run and broke the track record to raise the pressure on her Austrian rival. Flock didn’t appear to make any obvious mistakes but could not maintain the pace that she needed and dropped all the way to fourth at the finish.
Yarnold became the first competitor in the sport to win a second Olympic gold and the first Briton to win two Olympic titles in any sport at the Winter Olympics.
The top four finishers came from different backgrounds. Lölling and Flock had been skeleton sliders since their early teens whilst Yarnold was a converted heptathlete and Deas was recruited to the British programme from the sport of equestrian three-day eventing.
In a distant twentieth and last position was Nigeria’s Simidele Adeagbo although reaching the Games was remarkable for an athlete who had competed in her first international race only twelve weeks earlier.

Almost all the leaders achieved their best marks in round two, with Kozmus improving to 82.02 (269-1), which would eventually win the gold medal.

Of the leaders, he was the only thrower to improve after that round, posting 81.51 (267-5) in round five to move into third place and a seemingly disappointing bronze medal.
The medal places, however, would not be decided with finality for almost two years. Both Devyatovsky and Tsikhan tested positive for testosterone, and were disqualified by the IOC, but not until 11 December 2008. This initially moved Pars up to the silver medal and Murofushi to the bronze. It was the second successive Olympics at which Murofushi seemingly benefited from others being disqualified for doping as, in 2004, he had moved up to the gold medal position after the DQ of Adrián Annus (HUN).
Both Devyatovsky and Tsikhan appealed their disqualification to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS), however, and in June 2010, the CAS ruled that both athletes should not be disqualified because of irregularities in the testing procedures, with the ruling restoring them to their medal positions. After a 2013 re-test of samples from the 2005 World Championships came back positive, and then after further appeals, Devyatovsky was again cleared by CAS in April 2016, and retained the silver medal in this event.

The three favorites were all East German, led by Karin Enke, who had won the World Sprints in 1980, 1981, and 1983, and was second in 1982, and at the World Championships, she had won in 1982 and earlier in 1984, placing second in 1981 and 1983. She was expected to be challenged by Andrea Schöne, the 1983 World Champion, who had been second to Enke in 1982 and 1984; and Gabi Schönbrunn, who held the world record of 4:21.70, set at Medeo in 1981, and who had won the European Championships only a few weeks before at Medeo, winning the 3,000 and 5,000 at that meet. Schöne started in the first pairing and set a formidable mark, posting 4:24.79, for an Olympic record, at the time the fourth fastest ever. In the end it would win her the gold medal. Enke started in the third group, and started faster, leading through 600 metres, but after that she fell off the pace slightly, crossing in 4:26.33, but that would be good enough for the silver medal. Schönbrunn was in the next pair but never challenged her teammates at any time. She finished in 4:33.13, which would be good enough for the bronze medal, however.
The East German medal sweep was only the third ever in speed skating, following two in 1964 – by the Soviet women in the 500 and the Norwegian men in the 5,000 m. Enke ended her 1984 Winter Olympics with four medals – two gold and two silvers. She would end her Olympic career after the 1988 Calgary Games, eventually winning eight Olympics medals – three gold, four silver, and one bronze. Enke would also win 11 World Championships, six in the sprints, and five in the all-arounds. Schöne had first competed at the 1976 Winter Olympics as a 15-year-old. She would compete again in 1988, this time as Andrea Ehrig. She won three medals in Sarajevo, one gold and two silver, and would again win three medals in Calgary, finishing her Olympic career with seven medals, but this would be her only gold. Schönbrunn would also skate in Calgary, winning bronze medals in the 3,000 and 5,000, and ending her Olympic career with three bronze medals.

Yang had been the sports’ dominant figure since the last Olympics, winning the 1998-2001 World allround title, along with many distance wins in both individual and relay events. But in the 500 m, Radanova had proven herself as a force to be reckoned with. In October 2001, she had bettered the world record in the event during World Cup competition. Another title favorite would have been Yang Yang (S), but she was not selected in this event, the coaches favoring Wang Chunlu instead.
Yang [A], who had been under pressured to win China’s first Winter Olympic gold medal in the 1,500 m, had disappointed in that event, finishing only fourth. But this had given her courage, and she easily made the final in the 500 m, where she led from start to finish. With Radanova and Wang trailing nearby, Yang finally did win her (and China’s) first gold medal. Together with Wang, she toured around the track in tears while waving the Chinese flag.

The course was a fairly hilly ride of 11 laps of a 17.0665 km. course, with two large climbs that both peaked at 12% grades, the second of which over a full kilometre as the riders turned onto Pascoe Vale Road. The race was delayed when three Irish nationalists attempted to start the race.  Officials removed them and they then joined 200 supporters in passing out Irish nationalist literature.
Baldini always rode near the front of several breakaways, and on the 8th lap, he dropped everybody and rode the final 50 km. on his own, winning by almost two minutes. After his victory his victory was protested by the French and British, claiming he had been assisted by the photographer’s car. The protest was dismissed. Later in the year, Baldini broke the world hour record, shortly after turning professional.  In 1958 he won the Giro d’Italia for his major victory as a pro. He had a solid professional career, but never quite realized the hopes of the Italian tifosi, who were looking for him to be the next Coppi.

The latter had recently established herself as the dominant female skater. In 1991, she had won the World Allround Championships with three distance wins, and she had already won four consecutive European titles (1989-1992), winning the 1,500 m every time. But Hunyady, who had married an Austrian to escape from her native Hungary, had beaten Niemann at the Collalbo World Cup, having won the Warszawa event in Niemann’s absence earlier on.
But as with other events in Albertville, the competition was adversely affected by the warm weather. Several countries complained about the ice preparation schedule, which left the pairs immediately after ice cleaning with considerably better circumstances than those skaters in later pairs. This was to the benefit of a German outsider, Jacqueline Börner. She had been the World Allround Champion in 1990, but later that year she had suffered severe injuries in a car accident. While bike training in Berlin with several teammates, she was hit by a Trabant, after an altercation between the car’s driver and the skaters. She sustained leg, knee, rib and head injuries, and was still walking with crutches a year before the Olympics. She recovered in time for the Olympic season, but did not have high hopes for the Games. A third place at the Berlin World Cup gave her hope for a bronze medal in Albertville. But her first pair performance of 2:05.87 would land her the gold medal. Duped by the conditions, Hunyady (pair five) did no better than seventh, while Niemann (pair six) finished just 0.05 seconds behind her teammate. The bronze was surprisingly won by Seiko Hashimoto, also a three time Olympian in track cycling. While she had been runner-up behind Börner at the 1990 World Championships, she had recently concentrated on sprinting, and her 1,500 m medal was unexpected.

Eight laps of 24.354 km. course.,na,"The course of the 1964 road race began in front of the Takao Train Station, and comprised eight laps of a 24.354 km. course, making the final distance 194.832 km.  The course featured a fairly steep, but short, climb of 65 metres at the 11th km., followed by a short descent, and then a mild climb over the next few kilometers.  However, the course was not really difficult enough to break apart the peleton.  In addition, it was held in a heavy rain, which slowed the pace somewhat.
The Amateur Road Race World Championships had been won in 1961 by Jean Jourden (FRA), in 1962-63 by Italy’s Renato Bongioni and Flaviano Vicentini, respectively.  But none of these three entered the Olympic Road Race, both Italians having turned pro.  Earlier in 1964, the 1964 World Championship was won by the young Belgian rider, Eddy Merckx.
The relatively easy course kept the pack mostly together throughout the race. Of the 132 starters, 107 finished, and the first 99 riders crossed the finishing line together.  A few break-outs occurred, but the last of those ended 15 km from the finish, Merckx tried to get away with 1.5 km to go, but only managed a gap of some 20 m before getting caught by the pack. The two leaders of the sprint-out were Italy’s Mario Zanin and Denmark’s Kjell Rodian, with Zanin narrowly edging Rodian to win the gold medal.
Eddy Merckx was right there at the finish but the great Belgian rider was not a strong enough sprinter to win the race, and he finished 12th.  His time would come.  Merckx turned professional in April 1965 and became the greatest rider in the professional peleton, and is usually considered the greatest cyclist of all-time.  He was later nicknamed “The Cannibal” for his aggressive riding style and never-ending hunger for victories, which helped him win 5 Tours de France, 5 Giros d’Italia, 3 World Professional Road titles, and multiple wins in the one-day classics.
The results of the 1964 road race are somewhat in dispute.  The 1964 Official Report and 1964 Official Results both list “all” finishers, but they only agree in the first 35 places.  In fact, the Report only lists 86 finishers while the Results lists 107 finishers.  We have consulted multiple sources to try to make sense of this problem, including contacting national federations and some of the riders involved in the race.  We believe that the following results are an accurate representation of the finishers, but recognize that this problem may not be fully resolved.

Also missing was France’s Teddy Tamgho, the third longest jumper of all-time, but he could not compete in London due to an ankle injury.
In the final Taylor got off to a shaky start, fouling his first two jumps, having difficult with the ultra-quick runway. The first round leader was Italian Fabrizio Donato with 17.38. He improved that to 17.44 in the second round, but that only put him into second as the United States’ Will Claye was the first jumper in the order and had taken the lead with 17.54. Taylor got through to the final with 17.15 in round three, moving into fifth place, and Donato improved again, posting 17.45, although he remained in second behind Claye. In the final rounds, Taylor opened with 17.81, a mark that would put him into the lead and eventually win him the gold medal. Claye, jumping last in the final order, responded with 17.62 which would be his best mark and cement the silver medal. Donato would continue to improve, posting 17.48 in the fourth round, and he would finish third to complete the podium. The final two rounds were anti-climactic as none of the leaders improved their marks.
Taylor was the first American to win the triple jump since Kenny Harrison in 1996. Claye had already finished third in the long jump in London, making him the first man to win medals in both horizontal jumps since Japan’s Naoto Tajima in 1936.

Dewinter’s fight with  Andy Scrivani of the USA was costly for the American,  a number of cuts were opened up above his eyes and the resultant damage was blamed for impeding him in his quarter-final loss against the Swede, Erik Ågren. Ågren impressed those at ringside with his skilful performance against the courageous American, was briefly considered a possible champion but then lost his next fight to Stepulov of Estonia.
José Padilla’s medal hopes were ended by Imre Harangi of Hungary in the last eight and the Hungarian continued his run to the final by defeating Kops of Denmark.

By this time Harangi had began bleeding over both eyes, one cut was measured at nearly four centimetres, and his vision was becoming impaired. Despite his injuries the Hungarian fought back and from the second round onwards took the upper hand. An appreciative crowd cheered him as he edged ahead and took the verdict.
Stepulov and Ågren went on to win medals at the 1937 European championships. In the professional ranks. Simon Dewinter, who fought and lost a European title match, was most successful.

Collinelli made the final, where he outlasted France’s Philippe Ermenault to win the gold medal. Collinelli’s victory was aided by a new style bike, in which he rode with his arms outstretched well over the standard handlebars. It was also used by Italy’s Antonella Bellutti to win the women’s pursuit in Atlanta. The unusual position required by their bike was termed the Superman position because it resembled fictional accounts of the Man of Steel flying. Shortly after the Atlanta Olympics, the position was outlawed by the Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI). One month after the Olympics, Collinelli met Boardman at the final of the World Track Championships, Boardman winning as he shattered the world record twice, defeating Collinelli with a time of 4:11.114.

Ender opened a 1.16 second lead over American Kim Peyton and it seemed over. But Wendy Boglioli, swimming the second leg for the US, pulled back time as did third swimmer Jill Sterkel, who actually put the USA in the lead. As Claudia Hempel (GDR) and Shirley Babashoff started their anchor legs, the USA led by .40 seconds. Babashoff had been frustrated at Montréal by her inability to defeat Ender, whom she openly accused of using drugs, accusations that would prove to be true, but not fully known until after the fall of the Berlin Wall and the release of East German sporting documents.

He was World Champion in 1970-71 and European Champion in 1970 and 1972 and had already set 15 world records in his career. Schenk was trying to win all four races in Sapporo, but fell in his first few steps in the 500, finishing only 34th. But Schenk had already won two gold medals in Sapporo, the 1,500 and 5,000, when the 10K started, and he was the world record holder, having set the two most recent global marks, with his 14:55.9 at Inzell in March 1971 the current record.
But Schenk would have some work to do. In the second pair, Norway’s Sten Stensen finished in 15:07.08, respectable time on the Sapporo rink. The Netherlands’ Kees Verkerk, in the fourth pair, bettered that with 15:04.70. Schenk started in the 12th pair. He started out quickly, moving ahead of pace from the start, and by 8,400 metres was five seconds better than Verkerk and Stensen. He slowed slightly coming home, but finished in 15:01.35 for his third gold medal, matching the feats of Clas Thunberg in 1924, Ivar Ballangrud in 1936, and Hjalmar Andersen in 1952.
Two weeks later, Schenk would win the 1972 World Championships, sweeping all four events, as he tried to do in Sapporo, the first person since Oscar Mathisen at the 1912 World Championships to pull off that feat. In his career, Schenk set 18 world records, won eight major international tournaments, and his distance titles are too numerous to mention. Schenk was awarded the Oscar Mathisen Trophy in 1970, 1971, and 1972, and is considered one of the greatest speed skaters of all-time.

The defending champion was Brazilian Maurren Maggi, but she was not considered a medal contender in 2012 and did not make the finals. Before the competition even began, one jumper was out when Paraskevi Papakhristou of Greece became the first Olympian to be eliminated from the Olympics by Twitter, when she posted a racist Tweet concerning African immigrants in Greece and was excluded from the London Olympics by Greek officials. We’re not quite sure how to list this - perhaps DQtweet.

Both the finalists, Harry Blackstaffe and Alexander McCulloch, were champions of the Diamond Challenge Sculls at Henley - Blackstaffe winning in 1906 and McCulloch holding the title in 1908. One of the first round losers, Lou Scholes, was the top Canadian sculler and had won the Diamond Sculls in 1904. The only top scullers not present were Britain’s Fred Kelly, Henley Diamond champion in 1902-03 and 1905, but now retired as a sculler (he competed in the eights at 1908 Olympics), and America’s Frank Greer, U.S. champion in 1903-05 and 1908 and the 1904 Olympic champion.
In the qualifying rounds, Blackstaffe and McCulloch were not challenged at all. In the final, McCulloch, starting out of Bucks Station, took the early lead, but started by pulling fewer strokes than Blackstaffe. McCulloch opened up as much as 1 lengths and led through 1,200 yards before being caught by Blackstaffe. Shortly after 1 mile though, Blackstaffe had pulled ahead by 3/4 of a length, and McCulloch could not close the gap.
The silver and bronze medalists listed below are controversial. It seems likely that only gold medals, and no silver or bronze medals, were given. The rules, as given in the 1908 Official Report (p. 528), note, “The Winners or Winner of the events will each receive the British Olympic Council’s Gold Medal for the Olympic Games of 1908.”  And on another page of the 1908 Official Report (p. 37), one finds under Rowing, “Prizes: - Gold Olympic Medals to the winners in each Event.”  There is no mention of silver or bronze medals in either place. In the results section of the 1908 Official Report (p. 358). the four rowing events are listed, with only the winners listed under gold medals. No silver or bronze medal placements are listed.
Because of the set-up of the Henley course, only two crews or sculls competed at any one time. Thus the semi-finals and finals consisted of only two crews or single scullers. Certainly the losing finalist would seem to be considered the “silver medalist” although we do not know if those rowers actually received such a medal. In addition, it would seem natural, and consistent with other Olympic sports with head-to-head formats, such as boxing and tennis, to consider the losing semi-finalists as “bronze medalists.”
Olympic statisticians vary on the listing of these results. Erich Kamper, in Encyclopaedia of the Olympic Games, listed the losing semi-finalists in the single sculls and eights as finishing third, but he did not list the losing semi-finalists that way in the coxed pairs or coxed fours. Both Volker Kluge (Die Olympischen Spiele von 1896 bis 1980) and David Wallechinsky (The Complete Book of the Summer Olympics) consider all the losing semi-finalists as finishing in 3rd place. But in his more recent book, Olympische Sommerspiele: Die Chronik I, Kluge did not describe the losing semi-finalists as bronze medalists.
However, in keeping with our Guidelines (see Updates–>Guidelines), we have considered the losing finalists as silver medalists (2nd place) and both the losing semi-finalists as bronze medalists (3rd place). In those guidelines we note, “we consider all participants being placed first, second or third in the final standings to have received gold, silver or bronze medals respectively.”

Andiyev then defended his gold medal by decisioning Sandurski, 6-3, in the first match of the final. Balla repeated as silver medalist when he defeated Sandurski on criteria, after tying 6-6.
Khasimikov would win the World Championships in 1981-83 but never got to compete at the Olympics because of the Soviet boycott in 1984. He later became the first Soviet to become a professional wrestler, wrestling mostly in Japan, and won the IWGP Heavyweight Professional title in 1989.

Parlov was dominant in Munich and comfortably defeated opponents from Chad, Hungary and Poland on his way to fight for the gold medal. Facing Parlov in the final was the 19-year-old Cuban soldier Gilberto Carrillo. The inexperienced Carillo stated well and had the better of the opening exchanges but he failed to recover from a knockdown late in round one and was stopped in the final minute of the second run. Unlike other Communist regimes, Yugoslavia allowed its’ boxers to fight professionally and so Parlov took up this option in 1975. He won the European light-heavyweight title in 1976 and was World champion for most of 1978. He lost the title to fellow Olympian Marvin Johnson, then retired in 1980 following two failures to win another world title in the cruiserweight division.

The Palace, built in the 17th century, had been the summer residence of the house of Wittelsbach. The decision by the OCOG to move dressage to Nymphenburg, was hotly disputed. The decision to hold dressage in Nymphenburg instead of Riem was influenced by a state visit by Queen Elizabeth II in 1965. When she was in München, the 1964 German Olympic gold medal team gave a 10-minute dressage demonstration in front of the castle, which enchanted the Queen and influenced the München OCOG’s decision.
The event again consisted of a preliminary and final round, with the top 12 finishers in the preliminaries advancing to the finals. The top 12 final placements were based only on the score in the final round. Women were first allowed to compete in dressage at the 1952 Olympics and this event was becoming more and more dominated by women, with 21 of the 33 competitors in 1972, females also winning the gold and silver medals. One female competitor was Britain’s Lorna Johnstone, born in 1902, and at 70 years, 3 days old on the day dressage started, the oldest ever female Olympian.
Liselott Linsenhoff had first competed at the 1956 Olympics, winning an individual dressage bronze, but she next appeared at the 1968 Olympics, where she helped Germany win team gold. In München she had the highest score both in the qualifying and final round to win the gold medal. Second went to Soviet Yelena Petushkova, who was also second in both rounds. Linsenhoff’s teammate, Josef Neckermann, won his third consecutive individual dressage medal, after a bronze in 1964 and silver in 1968. Petushkova was married, for a time, to Soviet high jump champion Valery Brumel.

Teams consisted of three riders taking two rounds, with all three riders scores in both rounds to count towards the team total. The course was measured at 631 metres with 14 obstacles and 17 jumps, but only four of the 87 rounds were inside the time limit of 96 seconds, and it has been argued that the course was actually 693 metres long. Fifteen teams started the competition with only Ireland not finishing the two rounds. However, in Mexico City, if a rider did not finish a round, he and the team were not eliminated. Rather the rider was given a score for the round equal to the highest score of any rider who finished, plus 20 points.
Great Britain took the lead after the first round with 48.00 faults, ahead of Canada, with 49.50 faults, followed by France and West Germany. Canada, France, and the United States were 1-2-3 in the second round, and were very close, to bring Canada the gold medal. France won the silver, while bronze went to West Germany, which had been fourth in round one, and fifth in round two. Great Britain dropped back to eighth when Marion Coakes could not finish the second round, as her horse, Stroller, had a severe toothache. She was given the maximum points of 72.75 for her ride.

An was not competing in Vancouver, but Lee was. He was joined by two compatriots, Lee Jeong-Su, the 2006 World Junior Champion and Seong Si-Baek, who had dramatically crashed with Lee Ho-Seok in the final. But the Koreans would face tough competition from Apolo Anton Ohno and the Canadian Hamelin brothers, Charles and François .
In the first semi-final, the two Lees proceeded easily, while François Hamelin also made the final, following disqualification of J. R. Celski. The second semi-final heat saw a very close finish, with the first three finishing within 0.035 seconds - about a skate’s length. Ohno won the heat, followed by Charles Hamelin, who edged out Seong by just 0.006. In the final, the lead was initially taken by the two Canadian brothers, but they were soon surpassed by the two Koreans. Lee Ho-Seok was in front at the bell, but Lee Jeong-Su passed him on the inside on the back straight. Because of a wide final curve, Lee Ho-Seok was able to gain back a bit of ground in the final metres, but not enough to deny his compatriot victory. Behind the two Koreans, Ohno held off the Canadians to take the bronze.
A few months after Lee Jeong-Su’s two gold medals in Vancouver, he was convicted in a match-fixing scandal. Together with fellow Olympian Gwak Yun-Gi and their coach Jeon Jae-Mok, Lee was accused of having withdrawn during the March national team tryouts in favour of Gwak. The two skaters received an unusually severe punishment, as they were banished from competition until April 2013. Jeon was permanently expelled from coaching the national team.

In Rio she was hoping to become the first defending champion to retain it since Věra Čáslavská in 1968, but it was not to be as she fell foul of the two-gymnasts-per-country rule after finishing third in qualifying behind compatriots Simone Biles and Aly Raisman. Had she qualified, however, it would have been difficult to see her retain her title because of the vast superiority of her team-mate Biles, who was in a class of her own
At just over 142cm, Simone Biles was the shortest member on the entire US Olympic team in Rio, but underneath that petite frame lay an awesome gymnast. She was so dominant that team-mate Aly Raisman joked that for the remaining gymnasts, winning silver would be their gold! Biles was just too young, by three months, to compete at London but since those Games she had dominated the sport and won 10 gold medals at the last three World Championships including the all-round title on each occasion.
She opened her quest for her second gold medal of the Rio Games with a score of 15.866 on the vault to lead after the first rotation. Surprisingly, she slipped to second after scoring 14,988 on the uneven bars, her worst discipline. This allowed the Russian Aliya Mustafina to take a slim 0.034 of a point lead at the halfway stage. But Biles was back in her rightful position at the top of the leader board after a sublime routine on the beam, which included an amazing spin that earned her 15.433 points. Her final routine on the floor was just as awesome and was rewarded with 15.899 points as she won by an unprecedented 2.1 points. Team-mate Raisman took silver and the Russian Mustafina won the bronze medal to add to the one she won at London 2012 and in the 2013 World Championships. Biles’ win meant the USA became the first country to provide the winner of the individual all-round title at four consecutive Olympics.
To put into perspective how remarkable Biles’ performance was, her winning margin was 2.100 points, and since the event was launched in 1952, only one other gymnast has won by more than one point, and that was in 1968 when Čáslavská won by 1.4 points. Even more remarkably, the sum total of all winning margins in the 10 Olympics between 1976 and 2012 was 2.136, marginally better that Biles’ winning margin from just one Games.

Seventeen days later that mark was bettered by American Shirley Babashoff,  who had been runner-up to Turrall at the 1975 Worlds.

Thümer qualified fastest followed by surprise American Nicole Kramer. Babashoff won heat three, closely trailed by Turrall. The final was led by Canadian Shannon Smith through the first 300 metres, but Babashoff and Thümer then took over. They were in lanes 4-5, swimming as doubles, with two-beat kicks and bi-lateral breathing, and there was never open water between them.

After the first run it was Demchenko who led Loch by a margin of 0.015 seconds with veteran Armin Zöggeler of Italy, attempting to win his 6th consecutive Olympic medal, 0.336 seconds off the pace, and Austrian Reinhard Egger, a further 0.058 seconds behind.
The leader board changed after the second run as Loch posted the fastest time, 51.964 seconds, a new track record, to overtake Demchenko by an overall margin of 0.294 seconds, and Zöggeler a further 0.450 second behind. What was striking was that the fourth place athlete after the second run, Andi Langenhan  was now over a second slower than his fellow German Loch, a huge margin in the luge where often the results come down to thousandths of a second.
Little changed, other than the margins, in the 3rd and 4th runs, with Loch, Demchenko and  Zöggeler  being the three fastest in each run (in that order) and extending their lead over the rest of the field. Indeed Loch also set a new track record of 51.613 in his third run. In the final analysis, Loch won in a combined time of 3:27.526, some 0.476 seconds ahead of Demchenko and 1.271 seconds ahead of Zöggeler. Zöggeler’s bronze meant that he became the first person to win a medal in the same event at six successive Winter Olympics and was the first time the feat had been achieved in an individual event in the entire history of the Olympic Games.
Further down the field was a much more exotic competitor.  An attempt by a Tongan, Fuahea Semi, to qualify for the Winter Games was exploited by a German underwear firm called Bruno Banani as part of a marketing ploy. Semi legally changed his name to that of the company, although at first this was passed off as a coincidence, and narrowly missed qualification for the Vancouver Games. By 2014 he had improved enough to comfortably reach Sochi and competed without mishap during the Games. He placed 32nd and defeated competitors from a number of well-established winter sports countries.
In May 2016 WADA (World Anti-Doping Agency) commissioned a report, the McLaren Report, to look into allegations of systematic Russian doping and a cover-up to avoid positives at the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics. The report was released in two parts, in July and December 2016, and confirmed the allegations. In 2017 the IOC formed a commission to investigate this, headed by IOC Member Denis Oswald, and usually referred to as the Oswald Commission. In late October 2017 the Oswald Commission began to release its findings.
On 22 December 2017 silver medalist Albert Demchenko was disqualified as a result of the Oswald Commission findings.

They were joined by a young Frenchman, Charles Rigoulot. Rigoulot had a small lead after four events over Hünenberger, and then increased it by 10 kg in the last event. But matters could have been different. In the one-armed clean & jerk, the Swiss lifted 112.5 kg, a new World Record. But to the anger of the crowd, the lift was ruled invalid by the judges, and he had to be content with his best result of 107.5 - still a World Record. One of his compatriots, Dr. Anton Schärer, also set a new World record, in the press.
Rigoulot soon turned professional, and had a very successful career. He later also became a racing driver, winning the Bol d’Or in 1937. A member of the French resistance in World War II, he supposedly once escaped imprisonment by breaking the bars with his bare hands.

His teammate Leonid Zhabotinsky led the snatch with 167.5 kg and was in second overall, but trailed by 5 kg.

He then returned, a few minutes later, cleaned 217.5 kg, and easily jerked it overhead for a world record in the lift, giving him 572.5 kg and the gold medal over Vlasov in a huge upset.
Bronze went to American Norb Schemansky who had also won bronze in the class in 1960 and a silver in 1948. He won a gold medal as a middle-heavy in 1952, and his 1964 bronze medal made him the first Olympic weightlifter to win four medals. Zhabotinsky would return in 1968 at Mexico City and defend his gold medal. Vlasov never lifted competitively again, turning to writing short stories, novels, and poetry, and later became a politician.

Anything other than a German 1-2-3 at Cesena Pariol would have been considered a shock of monumental proportions.
Reigning World and Olympic champion Sylke Otto set the best times of day one and led at the halfway stage with Silke Kraushaar comfortably in second place, but some way behind the leader. The one surprise was American Courteney Zablocki, who matched the times of the third German Tatjana Hüfner. When Hufner pulled away from Zablocki after the third run the medal positions were effectively confirmed and the inevitable German sweep did in fact happen. Otto became only the second woman in the history of Olympic luge to retain her title whilst Kraushaar’s silver was added to a gold and bronze for previous Games. The track proved a challenge for the participants and six of the 30 sliders crashed out of the competition. Canadian Meaghan Simister was taken from the track in an ambulance after crashing during her third run. A crash also put paid to the Olympic career of 52-year-old Anne Abernathy of the US Virgin Islands. “Grandma Luge”, as she became called, crashed during a training run and was forced to withdraw suffering from a broken wrist. As the only entrant from her country in 2006 this meant the US Virgin Islands did not compete in Torino.

In the end, it was Dosho vs Vorobyova for gold. Dosho scored a two-point takedown in the final minute of the match to bring the score from 2-0 to 2-2. Because Dosho’s two-point score was better than either of Vorobyova’s one-point scores, Dosho won the match on criteria, thus dethroning the reigning Olympic and World champion. Dosho’s gold medal was the third of the day for Japanese women in wrestling, as her countrywomen Eri Tosaka and Kaori Icho had won their respective weight classes in dramatic finishes. Of the 18 gold medals awarded in the sport since women’s wrestling joined the Olympic program, Japan has won 11 of them.
Sweden’s Jenny Fransson, who had suffered losses in three World Championship bronze medal bouts, and who had lost to Dosho in the Rio semi-final, made history when she became the first ever Swedish woman to win an Olympic wrestling medal defeating Canadian Dori Yeats 2-1.

He would compete for the United States in the 1988 Olympics. The pre-Olympics held in February 1983 have been won by Paul Hildgartner followed by Danilin.
The first two days of competition were dominated by Ernst Haspinger, who had dramatically lost the 1980 Olympic title, and the surprising East German youngster Torsten Görlitzer. But both sliders faltered on day three, and dropped out of medal contention. The experienced Paul Hildgartner, 1972 Olympic champion in the doubles, and silver medallist in Lake Placid, took the lead, while Danilin moved up with a second place in the run. On the final day, Hildgartner and Danilin again topped the rankings, securing gold and silver medals for them. With another Russian, Dudin, in third, East Germany remained without a medal for the first time in Olympic history. Hildgartner announced his retirement after the title, but he would return to the sport and compete in Calgary.

They demolished South Africa in the first match but the unthinkable occurred in the semi-finals and they were defeated by Ukraine though, in fairness, their opponents were the 2007 World Championship runners-up. The champions of 2007 also fell in the semi-finals when France were put out by the host nation of China.
The China-Ukraine final was a classic. China maintained a clear lead until, with the score 40-36 in favour of the Chinese, the final pairing of Olha Kharlan and Tan Xue took to the stage. Kharlan, the outstanding performer of the final, fought back to tie the scores at 44-all with all to play for on the final hit. The two fencers appeared to score simultaneously and, after a lengthy video review, it was decided that a decision was impossible and they returned to fight once more. For the second time they appeared to score simultaneous hits but this time the referee decided in favour of the Ukrainian.

By 2012 the nation was in the position of having a “perfect storm” of three world class riders partnering three world class horses. Carl Hester, Laura Bechtolsheimer and Charlotte Dujardin had been clear winners of the 2011 European Championships ahead of Germany and the Netherlands and the three teams were to fill exactly the same positions of the podium in London.
Hester and Dujardin, produced three of the six scores of over 80% during the two rounds of the competition to ensure a first Olympic dressage title (or medal of any colour) for Great Britain. This was the time a German team had been defeated in Olympic competition since the Munich Games of 1972.
The roots of the British success go back to the 1980s and the arrival in the country of the German rider/trainer Dr. Wilfred Bechtolsheimer. The victorious British trio not only included his daughter Laura but also a former pupil in Carl Hester. Hester grew up on the tiny Channel Island of Sark, the only place in Europe where cars are still banned and horses are the staple form of transport. He in turn became tutor to Dujardin and was part-owner of Dujardin’s winning mount.
Edward Gal of the Netherlands recovered from the loss of his world championship winning horse, Totilas, to become a member of the bronze medal winning Dutch team. Ironically one of the riders he edged out for a place on the team was his civil partner Hans Peter Minderhoud.

The defending Olympic Champion Sven-Åke Lundbäck was on the Swedish team, and the last World Champion on wooden skis, the 15 km gold medalist from the 1974 World Championships, Norwegian Magne Myrmo, was also among the 80 competitors, but none of them had shown signs of their former brilliance during the Olympic season. The Soviets were highly favored, and the Nordic hopes were the consistent Finn Juha  Mieto and the Norwegian Ivar Formo, 1972 Olympic bronze medalist at the distance.
To everyone’s surprise, at 5 km, Arto Koivisto was in the lead, three seconds ahead of the Soviet Union’s  Nikolay Bazhukov with his teammate Belyayev another three seconds behind. Another Soviet skier, Ivan Garanin, was in fourth place, and the first four had taken a clear lead over the rest of the field. At 10 km, Bazhukov had taken over the lead, four seconds ahead of Koivisto, with Belyayev third 14 seconds behind and Garanin still fourth. Formo was a distant fifth, almost 40 seconds behind Garanin. Inspired by his team leaders, Koivisto now tried hard to catch Bazhukov. Five kilometers from home they were equal, but then, in a downhill part of the track, Koivisto had to throw himself down to avoid a collision with a tourist who had found his way onto the Olympic track. He lost a lot of time, and Bazhukov finished 2.7 seconds ahead of the fast-finishing Belyayev, with Koivisto able to secure the bronze medal, 21 seconds behind the winner. Only Belyayev had a faster finish than the young American Bill Koch, who was in 15th place after 5 km, 12th after 10 km, advancing to sixth at the finish, only three seconds behind Formo, proving that his silver medal in the 30 km race three days earlier was certainly not just a stroke of good fortune. Defending champion Lundbäck ended in 30th place, and the World Champion on wooden skis from 1974, Magne Myrmo, was a distant 55th, five and a half minutes behind the winner.
The new Olympic Champion was only 22, and born in a village by the Pechora River in the Komi Republic in Northwest Russia. His first international appearance was the 1975 Holmenkollen 15 km race, ending in a modest 32nd place, 2½ minutes behind the winner Juha Mieto.

On the eighth lap of the race, Longo got away with Italy’s Imelda Chiappa and Clara Hughes (CAN) and Anna Wilson (AUS). In the pouring rain, Wilson was dropped quickly, but the other three stayed away. Early on the final lap, Longo powered away from Chiappa and Hughes and rode to her much deserved gold medal. Hughes returned to the Olympics in 2000 in cycling and in 2002 and 2006, competed at the Winter Olympics in speed skating.

The man favoured to follow Balado as Olympic champion was a Russian, Aleksey Lyozin, who won the gold medal at the 1995 World Championships. The silver medallist at that championship, Vitali Klychko of Ukraine, was not to compete at Atlanta as he was kicked out of Ukrainian national team after failing a drug test. His replacement in the national team was his younger brother  Volodymyr who took full advantage of his unexpected opportunity.  Volodymyr Klychko defeated home favourite Lawrence Clay-Bey in his opening fight, demolished Swede Attila Levin, then upset Lyozin to reach the final where he was to face the most surprising finalist of the entire tournament. Paea Wolfgramm of Tonga was Oceanian champion and had won a medal at the 1994 Commonwealth Games but these honours were won against weak opposition and few thought that he would survive past his first bout in Atlanta. He won his first fight against future professional world champion Sergey Dukhovich then pulled off one of the great upsets in Olympic boxing by outpointing Cuba’s Alexis Rubalcaba.  Wolfgramm produced another upset win in the semi-final to ensure that his nation’s first Olympic medal would either be gold or silver.
For a brief period in the final it seemed as though the impossible was about to happen as the Tongan kept pace with Klychko but the fitness level of the Ukrainian began to tell and he pulled away in the final round to record the victory. After the fight it was revealed that Wolfgramm had suffered a fractured wrist in his previous bout.
Throughout Tonga there were mass celebrations in honour of their first Olympic medallist and the King declared a national holiday for the day of Wolfgramm’s return home. He later had a career in professional boxing though he met with only modest success.
In contrast, Volodymyr Klychko won the WBO world professional heavyweight title in 2000 and held it for 2½ years before losing it to Corrie Sanders. He won the IBF title in 2006 and has since added the WBA and WBO titles to his collection in a reign that stretched through 2013. He is generally accepted as the leading heavyweight of the 21st century. The only other legimate claimaint to that honour may well be his brother, Vitali, who has also held a version of the world title for a large part of the decade.

Not to be dismissed, however, was Vyacheslav Ivanov of the Soviet Union, who gained international attention by winning the 1956 European Championships. Other contenders included Perica Vlašić of Yugoslavia, the 1953 European Champion and 1954 Diamond Challenge Sculls winner, and Great Britain’s Tony Fox, a multiple Diamond Challenge Sculls winner and runner-up. There was also American Jack Kelly, Jr. (son of three-time Olympic rowing champion Jack Kelly, Sr.), making his third attempt to reach the Olympic single scull podium, having failed in 1948 and 1952.
With the exception of Fox, all of the tournament favorites survived the opening round, with Kelly posting the fastest time. In the semi-finals Vlašić, who had won his first heat with ease, lost steam and finished far behind Kelly and Stuart MacKenzie, the latter of whom had replaced 1948 Olympic champion Merv Wood despite having never competed internationally. MacKenzie proved his worth by leading through almost the entirety of the final, but an outstanding drive from last-placed Ivanov in the final section of the course saw the Australian lose the gold by over five seconds. Thus the Soviet Union defended the crown that it had won in 1952, MacKenzie earned an Olympic silver medal in his first international race, and Kelly finally earned an Olympic single sculls medal with his third-place finish. Kocerka, the pre-race favorite, finished fourth and off the podium. MacKenzie would go on to get his revenge at the Diamond Challenge Sculls, however, by winning the tournament on six consecutive occasions beginning in 1957, leaving Ivanov as runner-up in 1957 and 1958.

She succeeded in winning five medals, adding a bronze in the long jump, and surprisingly only a bronze in the 4x100 when the United States was upset by the Bahamas and Jamaica.

They later divorced, and she then married sprinter Tim Montgomery. In 2003 he was found to have participated with the BALCO Scandal and was banned for two years by the IAAF. In 2006 Jones almost tested positive for the only time in her career, with a sample showing use of eryrthropoietin (EPO) after the US Championships. But her B sample was negative and it was not considered a positive drug test. Shortly thereafter Montgomery was charged in a check-kiting scheme and Jones was implicated as well, and they later divorced.

Many sources describe the competition as a single game between an American side and a Swedish one, but there was also a second game held that is not often mentioned. The original schedule called for two games, beginning on the evening of July 10, during the track & field athletics competition. The first game was to be between two US teams, East vs. West, with the winner then taking on Västerås Bäsboll Klubb.
The American Olympic Committee, however, forbade the US players from taking part in any exhibition until they had finished competing in their primary events. The game date then shifted to the morning of Monday, 15 July, with Västeras playing a combined US team. The US intersquad game was postponed to 16 July. It was held at the Östermalm Idrottsplats (Athletic Park).
The second game received little press coverage in the states. The 17 July edition of The New York Times, however, described a game held the day after the USA-Sweden game (16 July). In this contest, two teams of American players squared off with the East squad topping the West, 6-3. Jim Thorpe, who later played Major League Baseball for a few years, played in the second game, playing right field and hitting a double in two trips to the plate.

In 2001 the silver medalist had been Finnish athlete Samppa Lajunen, followed by German Ronny Ackermann. The event consisted of a single jump on the large hill followed by a 7½ km cross-country race, started by the Gundersen Method with the jumping leaders going off first, in the order of their finish. On the large hill, Lajunen took the lead with a jump of 126.5 metres, to take a 3.9 point margin over Ackermann, which gave the Finn a 15 second start lead in the cross-country. In third place after the jumping was Lajunen’s teammate, Jaakko Tallus, who had already won a silver medal in the individual event in Salt Lake City. Lajunen and Ackermann were never challenged in the ski race, with Ackermann closing slightly but unable to catch Lajunen, who won by 9 seconds. Tallus could not hold onto the bronze, being passed by Austrian Felix Gottwald in the last kilometer of the ski race.
For Lajunen it was his third gold medal in Nordic combined at the 2002 Winter Olympics.

Aged 19, he had won at Holmenkollen in 1957 and 1958, and in 1959 he won the Four Hills Tournament, a prestigeous series of four competitions in Austria and Bavaria, inaugurated in 1953. For the 1960 tournament Recknagel and his fellow East German jumpers were denied visas from the West German authorities, and in his absence Max Bolkart from Oberstdorf, the venue for the first competition in the tournament, was the overall winner. Six weeks later those two would both be members of the joint German team for the Winter Olympics.
Finland’s best ski jumper was considered to be Juhani Kärkinen, World Champion on his home ground of Lahti in 1958. The Soviet Union had produced several top jumpers over the last few years, the stars being the 28-year-old Nikolay Kamensky, winner at Holmenkollen in 1958 and the colorful Georgian K’oba Ts’akadze. Norwegian jumpers were still having trouble adapting to the new aerodynamic ski jumping technique, but a new generation of young athletes were closing the gap to the world top class. Ole Tom Nord, aged 19, won the 1960 National Championships and was among the future hopes.
Helmut Recknagel made an impressive first jump of 93.5 meters and was in a clear lead after the first round. The youngest man on the Finnish team, 19-year-old Niilo Halonen, was in second position followed by Kamensky and Kärkinen. The 30-year old US ski jumper Ansten Samuelstuen, Norwegian born from Lillehammer and a recently naturalized US citizen, surprised the home crowd by lying in fifth place.
In the second round, Recknagel again produced the longest jump and was unchallenged for the Olympic title. Halonen made another good jump and won the silver medal by a clear margin. Austrian Otto Leodolter made the second best jump of the last round and advanced from sixth to bronze medal position. Torbjørn Yggeseth, educated as a fighter pilot in Canada and starting as a competitive ski jumper relatively late, advanced from eighth to fifth position with a good second jump and restored some of the lost Norwegian pride.
Helmut Recknagel was the first Olympic ski jumping champion from outside the Nordic countries. He and his fellow East German ski jumpers in the late 1950-ies developed a new aerodynamic technique by stretching their arms forward during their jumps, in Germany called “the Superman Pose”. Recknagel was later educated as a veterinary surgeon and for several years was a member of the East German and German Olympic Committee.

But despite this, the Russian conveyor belt of talent rolled on. Although Anna Shcherbakova was the current world champion, she had been conclusively beaten by her young teammate Kamila Valiyeva at both the Russian National and European Championship in the previous months and it was Valiyeva who had earned the title of favourite as the Winter Olympics approached. With Aleksandra Trusova ranked second in the world it was widely accepted that the training group, coached by Eteri Tutberidze, would sweep the medal positions.
All this changed dramatically after the events of the team competition when it was revealed that Valiyeva had tested positive for trimetazidine at the Russian Championships in December. The lab result was revealed to Russian authorities on the 8th of February, the day the team event finished. The next day, however, she had her provisional suspension lifted by the Russian Skating Union and that decision was upheld by the Court of Arbitration for Sport two days before the start of the women’s event on the grounds that, as a 15-year-old and by WADA rules a “Protected person”, she was subject to different rules than adult athletes, that the delay in processing her test impinged upon her ability to establish certain legal requirements for her benefit, and that she did not test positive during the Games itself. The IOC decided that if Valiyeva finished in the top three positions there would be no medal presentation at these Olympic Games and if she reached the free skating portion of the competition an extra skater would also qualify alongside her.
Valiyeva’s display in the short program, while not quite up to the standard of her performances prior to the Games, was enough to give her a narrow lead over Shcherbakova and Kaori Sakamoto of Japan with the third Russian, Alexandra Trusova, trailing in fourth after falling on a triple Axel attempt. This paled into insignificance compared to the events of the free skating two days later. Firstly, Trusova produced a hugely athletic performance in which the woman nicknamed “The Quad Queen” landed all five of her quadruple jumps to move ahead of Sakamoto. Shcherbakova, having suffered falls at her previous two major competitions, this time skated cleanly though without the bravura of Trusova’s performance. It was still enough to keep her at the top of the leader board.
Then came Valiyeva. Perhaps understandably considering the intense pressure she had been under in the previous days, her performance made for very uncomfortable viewing. She fell twice, stumbled on further occasions and was reduced to tears by the time she left the ice. She was also visibly upset by criticism from her coach, Eteri Tutberidze, immediately afterwards. This incident was later commented on by the usually diplomatic IOC President Thomas Bach – ““When I saw how she was received by her entourage with what appeared to be a tremendous coldness, it was chilling to see this, rather than giving her comfort or help.” When the scores were announced she had fallen out of the medal positions and into fourth place.
Shcherbakova, the gold medallist, appeared numbed by the situation whilst silver medallist Trusova was herself in a dire emotional state “Everyone has a gold medal, everyone, but not me,” she wailed. “I hate skating. I hate it. I hate this sport. I will never go out on the ice again! Never! I hate  it! It’s impossible, it’s impossible! You cannot do it this way.” In the end, with Valiyeva dropping off the podium, a medal ceremony did eventually take place.

Iglesias was a comfortable winner and had little further difficulty in moving through to the final.

A year earlier Berinchyk had been the man who ended the Cuban’s dreams of a second world title by winning a narrow points victory in a first round tie but here the tables were turned in Iglesias’ favour.

She won four medals, with golds in this event and in the team all-around, adding bronzes on floor and the beam. Shaposhnikova placed fourth in the all-around, and on the uneven bars, she was third in qualifying, but could not make the final when the two ahead of her were Soviet teammates. The leaders after team qualifying were East Germans Steffi Kräker and Maxi Gnauck, and Romanian Nadia Comăneci.

Randy Ferbey’s Edmonton rink had won three of the four world championships but they had performed badly at the Canadian trials, failing even to make the semi-final stage, and Canada would instead be represented by a Newfoundland rink led by former world junior champion Brad Gushue. Canada’s rivals for gold appeared to be the Swedish team led by three-time world champion Peja Lindholm and David Murdoch’s Great Britain team.
Canada faltered in early play and had to rely on victories in their last two matches to reach the semi-finals as the Finnish team were the most impressive qualifiers. The host nation Italy, who had no great pedigree in the sport, shocked Canada, USA and Germany and threatened at one stage to be suprise semi-finallists.
The Finns edged out Britain in the first semi-final whilst Canada’s match against the USA was decided when the Americans gave up five shots on the ninth end. The Canada-Finland final was a tight affair at the half way stage but a series of Finnish errors gave up six shots on the sixth end and Finnish skip Markku Uusipaavalniemi conceded with two ends still to play.
The composition of the Canadian team was unusual as, although Brad Gushue formed the team and was the nominal skip, the more experienced Russ Howard called the shots which was the traditional skip’s role. Howard, who celebrated his 50th birthday during the Games, was the oldest Winter Olympic champion since fellow curler Robin Welsh in 1924.
The USA defeated Great Britain for the bronze medal, America’s first in curling, in a match that was briefly interrupted by a streaker whose modesty was protected only by a strategically placed rubber chicken.

The first official sub-1:50 record was set in a Berlin World Cup by Ids Postma, only to be bettered by Kevin Overland later the same day. At the Dutch Olympic Trials, Rintje Ritsma again lowered it, to 1:48.88. Other favorites included the other Dutch skaters (Bos and Hersman (who replaced Wennemars after his injury in the 500 m) and Ådne Søndrål, Olympic silver medalist back in 1992, and runner-up at the two most recent World Championships.
The first to approach 1:50 was American KC Boutiette, who had converted from inline skating and had competed at the 1994 Games as a substitute for Dan Jansen in this event. His time of 1:50.04 held out until the last three pairs, with Jan Bos beating it first with 1:49.75. Next up were Postma and Søndrål, who fought out an exciting duel. Postma got off to a better start, but the Norwegian caught up, and at 1,100 m, the two were exactly equal. With Postma having the final inner curve, he seemed to have the advantage and beat Søndrål. But Postma stumbled slightly, and Søndrål had a very powerful last lap. He broke the world record by more than a second (1:47.87), with Postma also finishing well below the old mark. Only Ritsma, runner-up in 1994 and Overland were remaining, and Ritsma’s splits matched those of the two leaders. However, like Postma, he was unable to keep up with Søndrål’s pace in the final lap, and had to settle for a bronze. Søndrål’s world record wouldn’t last long, as the Norwegian broke it himself by nearly 1.5 seconds at the World Single Distance Championships in Calgary later that year.

In theory a skier could ski between three to six legs, but in reality, all teams alternated legs, with each sprinter skiing three legs. The event consists of a semi-final round advancing teams to a final of 10 teams. At Torino the event was skied classically, while in Oberstdorf, at the 2005 Worlds, it had been a freestyle event. The medalists in 2005 had been Norway, Finland, and Russia, in that order. On the opening leg, Canada’s Sara Renner snapped a pole and was handed a new one by Norwegian coach Bjørnar Håkensmoen. She was able to maintain contact on her leg, and Beckie Scott briefly took the leg for Canada. Eventually they were passed by Sweden, who won the gold medal, with Canada getting silver.
Finland won bronze as Norway was shut out of the medals. Many Norwegians were upset by Håkensmoen’s selfless act, which may have cost his team a medal, but Canada responded by sending numerous letters and thank-you notes to the Norwegian Embassy. Renner gave Håkensmoen a bottle of wine to thank him, but a Canadian businessman, Michael Page, donated 8,000 cans of Canadian maple syrup to the Norwegian Olympic Committee to express his gratitude.

Wang was fastest off the line, and never gave away her lead. The finish was close, however, having about a blade’s length advantage over Radanova. A similar margin separated third and fourth place, with Leblanc-Boucher taking the bronze. Fu was later even disqualified for an earlier infringement. Even then, Canadian officials disputed the result, as video replays showed Radanova had finished with her skate in the air, which is disallowed for safety reasons. They even filed a complaint with the Court of Arbitration for Sport, but it was denied.

Japan’s Miho Takagi had already secured three silver medals (500 m, 1,500 m and team pursuit) and was looking to win her first individual Olympic gold medal. An outsider was Brittany Bowe. Although a three-time world champion in the event (2015, 2019, 2021), and leader in the 2021/22 1,000 m World Cup, Bowe’s performances in the Beijing Olympics had been below expectations.
The first top time of the day was recorded by 1,500 m bronze medalist Antoinette de Jong in pair three, with 1:14.92. This remained unchallenged until Leerdam took the ice against Kimi Goetz in the 11th pair. After a tight crossing with Goetz, Leerdam made a small mishap in the third corner, touching the ice briefly with her hand. Despite this, she recorded the fastest full lap of the field, holding on for a final time of 1:13.83.
Two pairs later, it was Takagi’s turn. After recording the fastest opening of the day (17.60) together with Golikova, she paced her full lap a bit, trailing Leerdam by 0.01 at the bell. But with an excellent final lap, she clearly went into the lead, 1:13.19. Bowe, racing in the last pair, had the same opening as Golikova and Takagi, but lost nearly half a second in the first lap. But Golikova’s final lap had been almost three seconds slower than her first, which was exploited by Bowe, who clocked 1:14.61, a tenth faster than the ROC athlete, to win her first individual Olympic medal, a bronze.

The 200 was considered his better event, as his size and long strides sometimes needed some time to reach top speed. His biggest challenger was considered to be American LaShawn Merritt, who had won the US Olympic Trials. Merritt was better known as a 400 runner, winning Olympic gold in that event in 2008, twice winning the World Championships, and winning five World medals in the 400. Also highly considered were Canadian André de Grasse, who had already won bronze in the 100 behind Bolt, and American Justin Gatlin, silver medallist in the 100.
The three main contenders made the final, but Gatlin ran 20.13 in the semis and did not qualify, despite posting the fastest ever non-qualifying time. The final was effectively over in the first few strides as Bolt closed the stagger on Christophe Lemaître by 60 metres. He was never challenged, winning by almost a quarter-second over de Grasse, with Lemaître holding on for the bronze. Merritt was never a factor, finishing sixth.
The day after this gold medal Bolt anchored the Jamaican team to victory in the 4x100 metre relay, winning his eighth gold medal overall, and repeating the sprint triple. At the time this was thought to be a triple-triple, winning the 100, 200, and 4x100 in 2008, 2012, and 2016, but the Jamaicans lost the 2008 relay gold medal when Nesta Carter was later disqualified for performance enhancing drugs after a re-test of the Beijing samples.

Although the Soviets were favored, there were other World Championship medalists at the Games. East Germany’s Sabine Jahn and Petra Boesler were the 1975 runners-up, while Bulgaria’s Svetla Otsetova and Zdravka Yordanova were that year’s third-place finishers. Andrea Vissers and Helie Klaasse of the Netherlands had been the silver medalists at the final European Championships.
The Soviet Union staved off a challenge from East Germany to complete the opening round with the fastest time, while Bulgaria won the second heat with the third-fastest time. The Soviet Union looked strong at the beginning of the final, but soon lagged behind Bulgaria and East Germany. Despite a valiant last-minute push, it failed to catch up to either and had to settle for bronze, giving Bulgaria a victory and one of its first three Olympic rowing medals (the nation’s women also won the coxless pairs and earned silver in the coxed fours), while East Germany had to make due with silver.

Piller-Jekelfalussy won the gold medal, as expected, but the silver went to the surprising Giulio Gaudini of Italy, ahead of Hungary’s Endre Kabos, who narrowly edged out Germany’s Erwin Casmir for bronze.
Hungarian Attila Petschauer had been favored for a medal, but came in fifth. Petschauer, who was Jewish, was arbitrarily arrested by the Nazis in the summer of 1942 and assigned to hard labor in the Davidovka concentration camp, which was effectively a death sentence, and as a prominent prisoner, he was singled out for the harshest treatment. When in January 1943 his former teammate and current overseer Kálmán Cseh von Szent-Katolna identified him as an Olympic champion, Petschauer was beaten with a wire whip until his spine was exposed, until Colonel General Burdenko, chief surgeon of the Red Army, arrived a bit later, and stopped the brutality, but could not save his life. Petschauer was forced to climb a tree naked in the frigid weather, and had cold water sprayed on him. He died shortly thereafter. A documentation of this case appeared in the 1970s in Hungary and Petschauer’s death by torture was the subject of the 1999 movie Sunshine starring Ralph Fiennes.

Pikus-Pace was a veteran of 14 years of skeleton sliding whilst Yarnold only made her competitive début at the lowest level of international competition at the end of 2010. The two women had dominated the 2013-14 season and each had tasted victory in four of the eight World Cup races. The overall title had been decided when Yarnold had inherited victory at a race where the American had been disqualified for a minor technical offence.  Other contenders included Yarnold’s teammate, world champion Shelley Rudman, Pikus-Pace’s teammate Katie Uhlaender and top Russian hope Yelena Nikitina.
Although it wasn’t generally known until after the competition a turning point occurred six days before the event began. Pikus-Pace suffered a minor concussion during one of the training runs. It wasn’t serious but US team doctors advised her to pull out of a number of training runs. Whether this had an effect on the Olympic championship is hard to say as Yarnold would always have been hard to beat but it certainly did not help the American’s preparations.
Yarnold held a small advantage over Nikitina after the 1st run and progressively stretched her lead over the rest of the two days. As Nikitina faltered Pikus-Pace was able to put herself into a solid 2nd place but neither could prevent the Briton following in the sled marks of fellow countrywoman Amy Williams who had won the event in Vancouver. The margin of victory fell just short of a second with most of the interest on the final run centred on the chase for the final place on the podium.
Nikitina bled time on her final run but just had enough in hand to hold off Uhlaender for the bronze.
In May 2016 WADA (World Anti-Doping Agency) commissioned a report, the McLaren Report, to look into allegations of systematic Russian doping and a cover-up to avoid positives at the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics. The report was released in two parts, in July and December 2016, and confirmed the allegations. In 2017 the IOC formed a commission to investigate this, headed by IOC Member Denis Oswald, and usually referred to as the Oswald Commission. In late October 2017 the Oswald Commission began to release its findings.
On 22 November 2017 the bronze medalist in this event, Yelena Nikitina was disqualified based on findings from the Oswald Commission, along with the original fifth- and sixth-place finishers, Olga Potylitsyna and Mariya Orlova, respectively. Nikitina immediately appealed this decision to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS), and about 10 days before the PyeongChang Winter Olympics began, the CAS reached a decision and Nikitina was exonerated and her bronze medal was restored.

The event was put on the program in an attempt to have the throwers imitate the classic poses seen by discus throwers on ancient Greek amphora.  Unfortunately, almost nobody understood exactly what poses they were required to make during their throw.  The rules read as follows:
a)  For this test a pedestal 80 centimetres long and 70 centimetres broad is inclined, with a maximum height of 15 centimetres behind and a minimum height of 5 centimetres in front.
   b)  The Hellenic method of throwing the discus is something like the following:
The thrower places himself on the pedestal with the feet apart, and holding the discus in either hand. He then takes it with both hands slightly stretched, lifting them without letting go the discus, and stretching out the rest of his body in the same way in the same direction.  After that he turns the trunk slightly to the right and bends sharply, so as to bring the left hand when free to the right knee, and the right hand still holding the discus, as far back as the build of the shoulder permits.  At this moment, the right foot should be forward and the legs bent; the right foot rests on the sole, and the left on the toes only.  Then by a sharp and simultaneous extension of the whole body, the thrower throws the discus straight in front of him.
The Greek judges ended up being a bit lenient and Verner Järvinen won the event over Nikolaos Georgantas.  This rather upset Georgantas, who did not think Järvinen’s style was legal.  After the decision was announced, the Greek walked over to the pedestal and let fly in an unhampered manner, far outdistancing all other throws.  Matin Sheridan was probably hampered by his efforts to compete concurrently in the standing high jump.

Vladimir Kiselyov (URS) opened with 21.10 (69-2¾), only three centimeters off his PR, and that was good enough for the gold medal. But he would improve in the final round to 21.35 (70-0½), securing the gold, and surpassing 70-feet for the first time at the Olympics.

She had been the top steepler most of the year and it was thought a world record might be coming. The other top medal contenders were Kenyan Hyvin Kiyeng and American Emma Coburn. The threesome had finished in that order – Jebet, Kiyeng, Coburn – in May at the Pre Meet in Eugene, Oregon.
The final started out at a very slow pace, seemingly obviating any world record chances. At 1,000 metres Jebet took off and ran the final five laps in under 70-second pace to drop the field and run away to a gold medal. She needed to run the last lap in under 70 seconds to break the world record but her 70.9 finishing lap brought her home in 8:59.75, the second fastest time ever.
Behind Jebet, Kiyeng and Kenyan teammate Beatrice Chepkoech ran together and seemingly would join Jebet on the podium. Chepkoech, however, could not hold on to Kiyeng pace and Coburn caught her with about two laps to go. Coburn set chase for Kiyeng and almost caught her on the final water jump, but Kiyeng ran away on the in-run to take silver, Coburn winning bronze. Coburn’s time of 9:07.63 set an American record and moved her to eighth on the all-time performer list.

While the IOC tried to promote mixed gender events, others criticised the additional burden on participants, who also competed individually and in a team event. The world ranking list showed a completely different picture than in the singles events. Only one pair from the People’s Republic of China, Liu Shiwen and Xu Xin, appeared in the top 15 heading the ranking list, followed by Mima Ito / Jun Mizutani from Japan, and Cheng I-Ching / Lin Yun-Ju representing Chinese Taipei.
A total of 16 teams from as many countries could qualify for the Olympics. Four countries qualified via the ITTF World Tour Grand Finals in December 2019 (China, Japan, Hong Kong and Chinese Taipei), plus six winning continental qualification tournaments, and made up to 16 by teams from the ranking list. Six teams each from Asia and Europe left just four spots for the rest of the world.
The number one and two ranked teams from China and Japan faced each other in the final. While Liu and Xu gave away just one game on their way to the final, Mizutani and Ito found more difficulty, losing five games. They particularly had to struggle for a 4-3 victory over Germany after winning a hard-fought seventh game by 16-14. In the final, the Chinese favorites easily took the first two games. Japan came back to win the next three games for a 3-2 lead, but China levelled it at 3-3 and forced a seventh game. The last game went 11-6 to Japan to make them the only country other than China to win table tennis gold in Tokyo. Expectedly, third seeds Cheng and Lin, who had lost the semi-final against Japan, brought the bronze medal home to Taipei. Surprisingly, their opponents in the bronze medal match were France, who beat the much-fancied Hong Kong pair in a close quarter-final.

At the 1951 Worlds the German pair of pilot Anderl Ostler and brakeman Lorenz Niebert became champion at their first attempt and emerged as new favourites for the Olympic title. The duo, who had originally been rivals before teaming up, set a blistering pace on the first of the four Olympic runs and built a lead of 1¼ seconds. Although their next three runs were not as fast they were still fastest on every run and finished nearly three seconds ahead of the second place Americans with the veteran Fritz Feierabend steering Switzerland into third. The German victory was achieved despite the use of a bob that had been manufactured in 1936.
The 1948 champion, Felix Endrich, finished fourth in Oslo but regained the world title the following year in Garmisch. A week later he was killed instantly at the same track when his four man bob left the circuit and struck a tree.

Bulgaria’s Nikolay Buhalov, meanwhile, was the 1992 Olympic champion, while György Zala of Hungary was the 1992 and 1996 bronze medalist. Giles, Buhalov, Opalev, and Zala all appeared in the same opening heat, but none of them won it; that distinction went to Ledys Balceiro of Cuba, who had been runner-up to Giles in this event at the most recent Pan American Games. Giles, who was 0.276 seconds behind, came in second as was the only other of these men to qualify directly for the final; the rest were relegated to the semi-finals. The second heat was much simpler, with Dittmer and Doktor taking the top two spots, both qualifying automatically for the final, and the German doing so in Olympic record time. Opalev won the semi-final, but he was the only one to advance, as Buhalov and Zala were both eliminated. Dittmer dominated the final, taking gold over a second and a half before anyone else arrived, while the two North American nations duked it out for the remaining podium spots. Balceiro came out on top and won silver, his nation’s first ever Olympic medal in canoeing (although it would be followed less than two hours later by another silver medal in the C-2 1000), while Giles settled for bronze.

In contrast, Wendl and Arlt set a new track record of 49.373 to lead comfortably from the Lingers by 0.312 seconds, with their fellow countrymen Peter Penz and Georg Fischler a further 0.108 seconds behind.

Competitors losing to the finalists entered repechage tournament for bronze medals.,na,"In the inaugural women’s heavyweight freestyle wrestling event at the 2004 Summer Olympics Stanka Zlateva of Bulgaria finished last. By the 2012 Games she had five of the last six World Championship titles (2006-2011 except 2009), all the European Championships over the same period except for the most recent one, an Olympic silver medal from 2008, and was considered the overwhelming favorite for the crown in London. There were several secondary favorites in the tournament, including Wang Jiao, the defending Olympic Champion who had pinned Zlateva in the finals of the Beijing Games, but Wang had been unable to maintain this form on the international scene. Unlike in the other divisions, Japan was not considered a major threat for the crown as their entrant, Kyoko Hamaguchi, was already 34 and had a weak showing at the most recent World Championships. Still, with 10 medals from the World Championships stretching back to 1997, half of them gold, she could not be counted out.
With Zlateva and Wang ending up in opposite halves of the draw, many observers expected a rematch of the 2008 Olympic final. Wang was pinned in the semi-finals, however, by Russia’s Nataliya Vorobyova, whose best finish at a major international competition was third at the most recent European Championships. Vorobyova had also pinned Gyuzel Manyurova of Kazakhstan, the silver medalist from the 2004 Games, in the quarterfinals, who had in turn defeated Hamaguchi. In the final it seemed at first that Zlateva had the advantage, able to counter Vorobyova’s aggression and speed with raw strength and pushing the Russian out of the ring for a one point victory in the first period. Like a recurring nightmare, however, Zlateva found herself again pinned in an Olympic final, losing the gold medal by a fall for the second time. This gave Vorobyova the outstanding distinction of having pinned an Olympic champion and two Olympic runners-up in an Olympic tournament without ever having won a World Championships medal.
Having both been pinned by the eventual gold medalist, Manyurova and Wang met in the first bronze medal match in a rematch of the final from the 2011 Asian Championships, where the Kazakh had emerged victorious. They fought ferociously, each scoring one point in the first round, which was given to the Chinese competitor for having scored last. Wang pushed her opponent out of the ring in the second period and was leading the round until the final five seconds, when Manyurova was able to score three points in a last-ditch effort to extend the match into a third period. In the end, the medal was decided by luck: drawn into a par terre, Manyurova chose the red ball and was given the advantageous position, using it to score a single point that gave her the bronze. The final podium spot was contested between Vasilisa Marzalyuk of Belarus, runner-up at the most recent European Championships and bronze medalist at the 2005 edition as well as the 2011 World Championships, and Maider Unda of Spain, who had finished fifth in the 2008 Games and had bronze medals from the 2009 World Championships and the 2010 and 2012 European Championships. The duo was evenly matched, but Unda managed to get one point past the Belarusian in each round to win a second bronze at the impressive age of 35.

Team numbers were reduced from four to three, so all riders scores were to be counted towards the medal standings, although this was mitigated slightly by the ability, albeit with a penalty involved, to substitute a rider into the event if a combination was eliminated or withdrawn at the end of one of the phases.
With many of the most prodigious events of the 2020 and 2021 seasons being cancelled from the effects of the pandemic, it was difficult to ascertain the form of the entries, but Germany had taken the 2019 European Championships title while Great Britain had equalled this in 2017 and added the World Equestrian Games gold medal in 2018. The German team was missing Ingrid Klimke due to a serious chest injury, while Britain decided to omit all but one of their world champion team.
For the first time since 2008 Germany did not lead the competition after the dressage phase. Great Britain led the field with a miniscule two-point lead over the German team with New Zealand close behind in third. The title was decided on the cross-country phase when Sandra Auffarth recorded a refusal and Michael Jung fell foul of a newly introduced rule where if a horse dislodged a safety pin from a fence it counted as an eleven-point penalty. This dropped Germany from a close second place to a distant sixth. In contrast, Great Britain recorded three perfect rounds while Australia and France recorded only time penalties.
Sadly, the day was ruined by the death of Robin Godel’s horse Jet Set, which suffered an irreparable ligament rupture and had to be euthanized. The British could afford three fences down if every other team went clear in the show jumping phase, but only knocked two poles down and won by 13 penalties. Unusually the winning team was made up entirely of Olympic débutants.
Germany, despite a perfect round of show jumping, could not make up for the failings of the cross-country phase and failed to overhaul France and Australia for the medal positions. Andrew Hoy of the Australian team was 62 years 175 days old and the oldest Olympic medallist since 1968.

She won the gold medal in Atlanta, although it was relatively close as she had a margin of only 0.013 points over China’s Bi Wenjing and American Amy Chow, who shared silver medals.
Khorkina would compete through the 2004 Olympics. She was a three-time world all-around champion (1997, 2001, 2003), but never managed gold in that event at the Olympics, placing second in 2004.

A number of very prominent painters took part, including Max Slevogt, Otto Dill, George Grosz, Max Liebermann, Willi Baumeister, Hunt Diederich, Gerald Spencer Pryse, and others.
The gold medal was presented to Dutch painter Isaac Israëls for his painting De rode Ruiter (The Red Rider), in which the rider in his red skirt has stopped his horse. Art historian Richard Stanton noted that the painting was produced on behalf of J. J. Leeuwenburgh, the Lord sitting on his horse “Tristan.” The client did not like the painting so Israëls sent it to the art competition. This is doubtful, because according to the Dutch catalogue two versions of the “Cavalier Rouge” existed before. One belonged to a Mr. Glerum from Amsterdan, the other to Lord Scherjon from Utrecht.
Another famous painter entered in 1928 was Laura Knight, who won the silver medal with her painting Boxers, although Bernard Kramer, art historian, stated the boxer was not the best painting by Ms. Knight, noting, “Despite successful presentation of contrasting foreground and background with the dark auditorium and the boxers fighting in the full glare, the seething atmosphere of the boxing ring does not seem to be captured.”

He would have been even if the Soviet and East German fighters were in Los Angeles. Yamashita had lost the final of the 1977 Japanese Student Championships, but had not lost since, with 194 consecutive match wins or draws in national and international competition coming into the 1984 Olympics. He was a four-time World Champion, and almost always won his matches by ippon. In his pool, he won his first match by ippon in 28 seconds. In his second match against West Germany’s Arthur Schnabel, Yamashita won with a shime-waza submission hold for ippon at 2:50. But as he left the mat, Yamashita was clearly limping. For his pool final against France’s Laurent del Colombo, Yamashita was obviously injured, favoring his right leg. Del Colombo attacked the injured leg, and scored a koka, the first score given up by Yamashita for years. But Yamashita countered with ouchi-gari for yuko and went straight to a kuzure-kami-shiho-gatame hold-down for ippon to advance to the final. In the final he met Egyptian Mohamed Ali Rashwan, who had also won all his pool matches by ippon. As he came out for the final, Yamashita was limping worse than ever, having torn muscles in his right calf. Rashwan was quickly overcome, despite the injury, Yamashita using yoko-shiho-gatame for ippon in only 1:05. At the medal ceremony, Rashwan had to help Yamashita up onto the podium. In September 1985, Rashwan was awarded the International Fair Play Award, based on his supposed refusal to attack Yamashita’s injured leg in the final. Films of the match, however, reveal that not only did Rashwan attack Yamashita’s injured leg, it was his first move in the final.

When the competition got off to a start, the start time was set at 8 in the morning to make sure the course would not melt in the sun. The first run was eventful, as three of the 18 teams failed to finish. The crew of Germany II saw their bob continue without them, the second French bob lost its brakesman, while the Czechoslovakians became airborne and crashed. The fastest time was posted by the top favourite for the Olympic gold, Hanns Kilian. The Garmisch native was not only riding on his home course, he also had the 1934 and 1935 world title under his belt, as well as Olympic bronze medals in 1928 and 1932. But the crowd favourite lost his lead in the second run, which was interrupted because of the weather. When the race continued at 16:30, conditions were much better, which favoured the crews that drove after the interlude, notably Great Britain and Switzerland II. The latter crew, piloted by the 1935 runner-up at the World Championships Pierre Musy, led the event after day one.
Musy, son of former Swiss president Jean-Marie Musy, further increased his lead by winning the third run, then consolidated in the final descent. His compatriot Reto Capadrutt, 1932 silver medallist in the two-man bob, won the final run in a new track record, beating Kilian’s 1:18.70. The bronze medal was by one of the most interesting characters at the 1936 Olympics, Freddie McEvoy. The native Australian was a noted racing car driver, who moved around in the highest classes but was also a noted gambler, con artist and womanizer.

At the European Championships 1948 in Prague two weeks before the Olympics, (ISU Championships were open to non-Europeans in 1947 and 1948) Button faced Gerschwiler again, and this time the American won an undisputed title.
Two days before the Olympic free skating event, Button successfully landed a double Axel in a training session. Having a scant lead over Gerschwiler after the compulsory figures, Button decided to include the double Axel in his free skating program. He successfully landed the jump, being the first ever figure skater to do that in a competition, and won the gold medal with a clear margin.
At the World Championships in Davos one week later Button won his first World title, again ahead of Gerschwiler, who then turned professional. The bronze medallist from St. Moritz, Austrian Edi Rada, had to withdraw after the compulsory figures due to the failure of his skates, and Hungarian Ede Király (5th in the Olympics) was able to outscore US skater John Lettengarver (4th in the Olympics) in a close battle for the bronze medal.

Cherif and Ahmed were too good for Latvia’s Pļaviņš and Točs in the bronze medal match, winning 21-12, 21-18, capturing Qatar’s first ever beach volleyball medal and depriving Mārtiņš Pļaviņš the chance to win another bronze medal to go with the one he won in 2012 with Jānis Šmēdiņš.

But in the semis, Serbia & Montenegro (Yugoslavia), runners-up at the 1998 Worlds, and bronze medalists at the 1999 Europeans, triumphed in straight sets, again denying Italy an Olympic gold medal. Serbia & Montenegro had struggled in the pools, finishing only third behind Italy and Russia, but they defeated Russia in straight sets in the final to win the gold medal. As in 1996, all the medalists came from the same pool, this time Group B.

But the 1,000 m seemed the perfect distance to set things straight, with heavily favored Karin Kania expected to win the gold. Defending Olympic champion Kania had won all four World Cup races in the distance this season, as well as the two 1000 ms at the World Sprint Championships. She had in fact won the World Sprint Championships six times in the past nine years. In addition, she had held the world record since 1986, last improving it at the Calgary World Cup in December 1987, to 1:18.11. The other medal contenders were the other two medallists in the 500 m, winner Bonnie Blair and runner-up Christa Rothenburger, and 1984 silver medallist Andrea Ehrig.
Ehrig started in the first pair, but her 1:19.32 was well outside the world record, which was not expected to hold up during the competition. In the third pair, Blair managed to beat Ehrig’s time by a full second, but her 1:18.31 was still two tenths off Kania’s rink record from December. Kania skated in the next pair. She started more consevatively than Blair, trailing the American’s split by half a second at the bell. But the former World Allround Champion had a much better final lap, gaining a full second on Blair. This gave her the lead, while lowering her own world record to 1:17.70. But Kania still had to wait for her teammate Rothenburger in the next pair. A typical sprinter, she got off at the same pace as Blair, meaning she had a half-second lead on Kania at 600 m. While Rothenburger also faded in the final lap, she did manage to hold on to her lead, and squeeze out 1:17.65, lowering the world record even further.
Rothenburger, whose world record would stand for nearly a decade, would win a third Olympic medal later in the year. At the Seoul Summer Olympics, she participated in the women’s track cycling sprint, gaining a silver medal. That made her the first person to win medals in the Winter and Summer Olympics in the same year. Since the Winter and Summer Games are no longer held in the same year, she will likely remain the only person to have achieved this.

While previously the modern pentathlon consisted of five events, in 2009 the shooting and cross-country running were combined into a single event similar to the Winter Olympic biathlon. Runners carried a laser pistol as they ran and stopped at three shooting stations during their run, at which they were required to produce five shots on target, with penalties for extra shots needed and time penalties.

Germany swept the medals, with silver going to the team of Johannes Lochner and Florian Bauer, while Christoph Hafer and Matthias Sommer took bronze. Lochner competed in 2018, but without winning a medal, while Bauer, Hafer, and Sommer were making their Olympic débuts. Germany’s medal sweep was the first ever in bobsleigh. More than two sleds in any event have only been allowed at the Olympic Winter Games since 2010.
There have been 22 cases of NOCs putting two sleds on the podium in men’s bobsleigh, 13 times in two-man and nine times in four-man. The women had also had three multi-podia previously in the two-woman event. For the men, NOCs had gone 1-2 11 times in bobsleigh – six times in the two-man. The last of these occurred in 2010 by Germany, and before that, by Switzerland in 1994.
This was the eighth medal sweep by Germany at the Olympic Winter Games, but only the third in a men’s event, after the 2018 Nordic combined large hill / 10 km event and the 1964 luge men’s singles.
Since 1952, a German, or German-related team, such as the German Democratic Republic (East), or the Federal Republic of Germany (West), had won a medal in the two-man event at every Olympic Winter Games, except for 1956, 1964, 1994, and 2014.
Friedrich and Margis became the fifth and sixth sliders to win two gold medals in this event, and this is the third time that the same pair has defended the two-man title, after Gustav Weder and Donat Acklin (Switzerland) in 1992-1994, and André Lange and Kevin Kuske (Germany) in 2006-2010.
In sixth place was the sleigh of Rudy Rinaldi and Boris Vain, which produced the best-ever finish for Monaco at the Olympic Winter Games. The previous best finish was 12th in the 2006 two-man bob.
Despite recent German dominance, Switzerland still led the medal table in this event with 16 after Beijing, with Germany on 12 medals, but this victory moved them ahead of Switzerland in gold medals, 6 to 5. Prior to this event, Germany trailed the United States in total bobsleigh medals, 27-25, but the medal sweep moved them ahead of the USA, 28-27. Both NOCs trailed Switzerland, which had 31.
Justin Kripps (Canada), who shared the gold medal with Friedrich four years ago in PyeongChang 2018, finished in 10th place in Beijing. Brad Hall and brakeman Nick Gleeson (Great Britain ) suffered a crash in the first run of the day at curve 13, and crossed the finish line with their sled on its side. But Hall recovered for the fourth and final run to finish 11th overall.

Steiner lifted 192 kg on his first lift and then went for 196 kg for his second attempt, but was unsuccessful and, as he dropped the weight, it came down on the back of his neck. Although he was not seriously injured in the accident, he was unable to compete any further and dropped out. In the clean and jerk Anoushiravani took an early lead with a 237 kg lift and was soon followed by Albegov, who lifted 240 kg to take first place. The Iranian responded with a 245 kg lift to retake the gold medal position while Jeon Sang-Gyun of South Korea, 2010 Asian Games runner-up and 2011 world bronze medalist, lifted 246 kg to slide into the final podium spot. Salimi then entered with a successful attempt at 247 kg, enough to give him a six point lead in the competition. Albegov was unable to match this and thus remained in third, albeit a comfortable 12 points head of Jeon, the only remaining competitor who could knock him off the podium. While he was waiting, Anoushiravani tried a 251 kg lift to pass Salimi but was unsuccessful, settling for silver. Jeon returned with the 259 kg attempt he needed to pass Albegov, but failed and was left out of the medals. Salimi, now guaranteed gold, chose 264 kg for his second lift and tried to surpass the world record for the clean and jerk. Unsuccessful, he bowed out of a third attempt and went home an Olympic champion.

Together they had shared the World Championships between 1982 and 1989, save for 1982, won by Connie Carpenter-Phinney, winner of the inaugural women’s Olympic road race in 1984. Twigg had won a bronze medal in the pursuit in 1992, but had again won the world pursuit title in 1993 and 1995. Twigg was known for her brains and her looks as well as her cycling abilities. She started college when only 14-years-old and had worked part-time for several years as a model. Based on her recent World titles, and her past palmares, she was a slight favorite. But she was unable to overcome the Italian, Antonella Bellutti and her new bike, with the revolutionary handlebars and riding position, termed the Superman position for its resemblance to his fictional flying posture. Bellutti led the qualifying and won all her races by over five seconds. Twigg lost in the quarters to Germany’s Judith Arndt. Arndt in turn lost to the 1994 World Champion, Marion Clignet (FRA), in the semis, before Clignet succumbed to Bellutti in the final. Shortly after the Olympics, Clignet would win the 1996 World Championship, with Bellutti placing third. Twigg would race for one more year, retiring after 1997, when she raced mostly in the United States. Clignet was American-born but had been unable to make the US team for international races, so used dual French citizenship to compete for France internationally.

Five of the 16 qualified teams came from East Asia, seven from Europe, and the remaining four represented the rest of the world. Only Brazil, other than teams from Asia and Europe survived the first round.
Like in Rio, the team rounds were played in the so-called “Beijing System” of one doubles, two singles, and up to two more singles matches if required, as the first team to win three matches won the contest. All matches were played to the best-of-five games.
In the four rounds, the heavy favourites China did not lose a single match, winning 36 games and losing just seven in taking the gold medal. With Fan Zhendong, Ma Long, and Xu Xin the country called up the top three players in the world. Germany, the eventual silver medallists, had to survive two narrow 3-2 encounters in the quarter- and semi-finals against Chinese Taipei and Japan, respectively. With Timo Boll and Dimitrij Ovtcharov, the Germans included two veterans and former world No. 1 players who had won a medal at every Olympics since 2008. The other member of their Tokyo trio, Patrick Franziska, won his first Olympic medal.
The bronze medal was won by Japan, who beat South Korea 3-1. The first four teams in Tokyo are the only countries to have won a medal in the men’s team event since it was launched at Beijing in 2008.

Competitors losing to the finalists entered repechage tournament for bronze medals.,na,"Since his first appearance at the Olympic Games in 2000, Artur Taymazov of Uzbekistan had reached the finals of the men’s super-heavyweight freestyle wrestling tournament every time and had lost only once, in his first attempt. He was also a two time World Champion (2003 and 2006) and runner-up (2001 and 2010), twice Asian Champion (2000 and 2011), and three-time Asian Games gold medalist (2002, 2006, and 2010). Nonetheless he was expected to have some significant challengers at the 2012 Summer Olympics, most notably Bilyal Makhov of Russia, a three-time (2007, 2009, 2010) World Champion and 2010 European Champion. Makhov lost his world title in 2011 to Aleksey Shemarov of Belarus, however, who would also be looking to challenge Taymazov in the final. Not to be counted out was Taha Akgül of Turkey, the reigning European Champion.
Taymazov was drawn into a relatively easy half that included Shemarov, who was defeated by Tervel Dlagnev of the United States, the 2011 Pan American Champion. Taymazov pinned Dlagnev in the semi-finals and went on to meet Davit Modzmanashvili of Georgia in the gold medal match. Modzmanashvili was a bronze medalist at the most recent World and European Championships who had returned from a doping violation in 2008 and defeated Bilyal Makhov in the semi-finals of the London tournament. In the final, Taymazov proved himself once again to be worthy of Olympic Gold, winning the first round par terre by successfully reversing Modzmanashvili’s advantage and pushing the Georgian out of the ring in the second period for an unanswered point that earned him the Olympic crown.
The first bronze medal match pitted Dlagnev against Komeil Ghasemi of Iran, runner up to Taymazov at the most recent Asian Championships. Ghasemi wasted no time in the first period, winning it within the first 20 seconds by scoring four points that would remain unanswered. The second period went to par terre, where the American drew the advantage and converted it into a point, but the Iranian was able to push his opponent out of the ring in the final ten seconds of the last round to earn the bronze. The final podium spot was decided between Makhov and Daulet Shabanbay of Kazakhstan, who had won his first his first major international medal at the age of 14 in the heavyweight division of the 2008 Asian Championships and repeated the feat in 2009 and 2011 before moving up to the super-heavyweight class. Makhov’s experience was on display in the first period, scoring five unanswered points, but Shabanbay responded in the second round with a three-point shutout of his own. In the final period, the three-time World Champion was simply the better wrestler, and won the medal with a 3-0 score.
That was how the event and the results seemed to have ended. In 2015, however, the IOC began re-testing samples from the 2008 Beijing and 2012 London Olympics, using newer, more advanced testing techniques, in an effort to find those who had used performance enhancing drugs (PEDs), but in whom it could not be detected at the time of those Olympics. This was one of the many events affected.
The original silver medalist, Davit Modzanashvili of Georgia, was later disqualified when he was revealed to have a re-test positive for both dehydrochloromethyltestosterone (turinabol) and stanozolol. His silver medal was removed. In July 2019, the gold medalist, Artur Taymazov of Uzbekistan was similarly disqualified when a re-test of his doping sample showed evidence of dehydrochloromethyltestosterone (turinabol) metabolites. In February 2020, the IOC ruled on the final standings and medals and awarded gold medals to both Ghasemi and Makhov, while Dlagnev and Shabanbay became the bronze medalists. Dlagnev received his bronze medal on 6 March 2022 at the 2022 Big 10 Conference Wrestling Championships.

He débuted in the sport in 2002, and in 2004 he became an upset World Allround champion. His best event turned out to be the 5,000 m, winning the world title in both 2004 and 2005. In late 2005, he also bettered the world record in the event, although Sven Kramer lowered it again the next weekend. This feat also made Kramer Hedrick’s foremost contender, in addition to Carl Verheijen, Norwegians Ervik and Grødum, and home favorite Enrico Fabris. To add to the pressure, Hedrick had boldly announced that he would be aiming for 5 gold medals in Torino, competing in the 1,000, 1,500, 5,000, 10,000 and team pursuit.
Verheijen led the pack with 6:18.84 when Kramer started. With a solid race, he timed 6:16.40, but left room for Hedrick on some of his laps. With Hedrick starting the very next pair, Kramer’s time was soon doomed. Hedrick quickly took a 1-second lead, slowly extending it to about 2 seconds. Hedrick’s final time was quite close to the Olympic Record set at high altitude, finishing in an excellent 6:14.68. The remaining skaters were no threat to Hedrick. Skating in the final pair, it appeared Enrico Fabris could not medal either, trailing Verheijen’s time by more than 2 seconds at 3,800 m. But with fast closing laps, he managed to close the gap, making up for a 7-tenth gap in the final 400 m to win the bronze medal, Italy’s first ever speed skating medal at the Olympics.

The battle for silver and bronze seemed as if it would be between the ROC and China, who both had plenty of talented gymnasts for the big occasion.
Biles was far from her best in the qualifying competition, and was penalised for both her floor and vault exercises. As a result, the United States finished behind ROC. It was the first time since 2010 that the USA had not posted the top score in qualifying at a World Championships or Olympics. The ROC, with 2019 World Championship all-round bronze medallist Angelina Melnikova in their squad, led the Americans by 1.067 points at the end of qualifying.
A win would give the Americans their third-straight gold medal, a feat not seen since the Soviet Union won eight straight from 1952-80. The ROC started off well, however, and put the Americans under pressure from the start, and despite getting tremendous height on her vault, Biles had a bad landing and scored just 13.766. It was her lowest score on that piece of apparatus in her Olympic career, and only three gymnasts had a lower score than her in the vault. That one vault turned out to be the only appearance of Biles in the final, as she sat out the remaining rotations. Initially it was thought she had suffered an injury on landing, but as she later admitted, the only injury she suffered was to her pride and did not want to carry on. It was more a mental than physical problem.
In the second rotation, despite a 13.700 on the uneven bars by Grace McCallum, her score was bettered by ROC’s Vladislava Urazova, who scored 14.866. When Jordan Chiles, who had stepped in for Biles on the uneven bars, scored an impressive 14.166 she too was upstaged by the ROCs Angelina Melnikova with 14.933. The ROC led by two-and-a-half points at the end of rotation two, with Italy having replaced France in the bronze medal position. The USA pulled themselves back into contention at the end of the third rotation and were less than a point behind with Italy still in third place, with Great Britain making up ground in fifth.
Unfortunately, the US comeback was short-lived when Chiles, who had done so well standing in for Biles, had a disappointing 11.70 on the floor as the ROC went three points clear thanks to 14.166 from Viktoriya Listunova. With just one gymnast each left to perform, the ROC went on to secure gold, with silver going to the USA. The ROC headed the scoring on three of four pieces of apparatus, finishing only fourth on the beam. The best individual performance of the final was Urazova’s 14.866 on the uneven bars.
After three excellent performances on their last routine, the uneven bars, the British quartet snatched the bronze medal from Italy by 0.458 points. It was Britain’s first team medal since they won bronze at Amsterdam in 1928, when women’s gymnastics was first held at the Olympics.

Xiang and Zhapparkul posted the best results in the snatch portion, with 116 and 115 kg respectively, while Egypt’s Sara Samir, the reigning African and Arab champion, positioned herself in third with a lift of 112 kg. In the clean and jerk, Xiang lifted 145 kg in her second round and, although she failed to lift 147 kg in her third try, Zhapparkul, who had struggled to post 140 kg, did not attempt to catch up. This assured Xiang the gold medal and Zhapparkul, who successfully lifted 144 kg, secured silver. Samir had lifted 143 kg, which would have given her silver had Zhapparkul failed at 144 kg, but instead she settled for bronze. This made Samir the first Egyptian woman to receive an Olympic medal (Abir Abdulrahman retroactively received silver from the heavyweight weightlifting division at the 2012 Summer Olympics after the three medalists from that event were all disqualified for doping concerns, and later received bronze in the light-heavyweight division of the 2008 Games for similar reasons) and the first Egyptian to win an Olympic weightlifting medal since 1948 (with the same caveat as above).

There he met Tomov, who had defeated Kolchynskiy six consecutive times, including at the 1976 Europeans, but in Montréal Kolchynskiy prevailed by decision, 12-6, to win the gold medal, with Tomov settling for another silver. Lee would place fifth and was eliminated after a fourth-round loss to Romania’s Roman Codreanu, who went on to win bronze. In 1980 at Moskva, Kolchynskiy would repeat as gold medalist, again defeating Tomov, who would win his third consecutive silver in this class.

With three race wins, and a lowest placing of sixth in the preliminaries, the Kiwis secured the gold medal before sailing the medal race. But unlike other classes, where the guaranteed winners tried not to take any chances, Burling and Tuke dominated the medal race with a perfect performance. With this final victory they increased their lead to an incredible 43-point margin. Burling was only 25 years old at the Rio Olympics, and both sailors are among Team New Zealand for the 2017 America’s Cup with Burling as skipper. They were named Sailors of the Year in 2015 and were nominated again in 2016.
Prior to the medal race, only two boats could win the other two medals: Germany with Erik Heil and Thomas Plößel on 67 points after the preliminaries, and the 2012 gold medalists Nathan Outteridge and Iain Jensen of Australia just three points behind. All other teams were out of reach. Australia finished fourth in the medal race while Germany could only finish eighth and the Australians took silver, while Germany’s bronze was their only sailing medal in Rio. Jensen and Outteridge, as Skipper, will also take part in the 2017 America’s Cup, as part of Sweden’s team.
In 2015, Erik Heil contracted an infection, probably from the polluted water in Guanabara Bay, but after their bronze medal success both German sailors jumped into the water to celebrate, with Heil claiming that it: “Was much better this year”.

The USOC wanted the AAU team to compete, but the AHAUS team was affiliated with the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF), while the AAU team was not.  The IIHF threatened to withdraw ice hockey from the Winter Olympics if the AHAUS team was not allowed to compete.  Eventually, they did compete and initially finished fourth.  However, they were later disqualified and their finish was not counted in the final standings.  Because of the controversy, the IOC originally announced that the 1948 ice hockey results would be unofficial, but they reversed this decision during the Olympic tournament.
The tournament was a nine-team round robin.  Canada played eight games, winning seven, and skating to a scoreless tie against Czechoslovakia.  Czechoslovakia also won seven games and the two teams finished with equal records of 7 wins and 1 tie.

His eligibility was questioned and he had to swear his allegiance to the U.S. Consul General in England and expressed his intention to return to the United States after the Olympics and eventually resume his duties of citizenship.  To our knowledge, this never occurred.  It is not recorded that Winans ever set foot in the United States.  He was a renowned equestrian sculptor, exhibiting 14 times at the British Royal Academy.

There were two series with the target in view for 8 seconds, two series with it in view for 6 seconds, and two series with it in view for 4 seconds. Scoring was first by number of targets hit, and then by score. The target was a silhouette figure of a man, 160 cm. in height and 45 cm. wide, with 10 scoring rings. The pistol or revolver had to be of .22 calibre. Most shooters used the Walther Olympia as in 1936, but the Italian Beretta was also popular. The top 22 shooters succeeded in hitting all targets so the competition came down to points scored. The event was won by Károly Takács of Hungary, who scored 580 points. In second was Carlos Enrique Díaz of Argentina, who was the reigning world champion and used a Colt Woodsman pistol, equipped with a compensator to reduce recoil and muzzle flip. Takács had been a top shooter before the War, and was a member of the Hungarian team that won the world team title at Luzern in 1939. He was on the national team from 1929 thru 1938 as a right-handed shooter. But in September 1938, during Army maneuvers, a grenade blew off his right hand. He taught himself to shoot left-handed and was good enough by 1939 to re-make the national team.

The best American jumper was Harry Porter, who in 1908 won the AAU title and the Eastern Olympic Trial.  Porter had also been 2nd at the 1905 IC4A Meet.
The Official Report makes no mention of qualifying conditions but there were eight scheduled qualifying sections, which were consolidated into four pools.  After Pool One had been completed at the South End of the Stadium, the officials decided that the slippery conditions were unsuitable and moved the remaining three pools to another jumping area at the North End of the Stadium.  Herbert Gidney (USA), who had not qualified in the first pool, then lodged a protest, claiming that the original results of the first pool should be declared void and the competition held again under more favorable conditions at the North End.  Despite the fact that all the competitors had been equally affected by the original adverse conditions, the judges, rather surprisingly, upheld Gidney’s protest.
Otto Monsen (NOR) and Edward Leader (GBR) had shared first place in the original competition, but Monsen refused to take part in the re-scheduled event, while Leader failed to match the height he had achieved in the less favorable conditions.  The only beneficiary of the protest was Gidney himself.
Having won the competition, Harry Porter made three unsuccessful attempts at the world record height of 6-5 5/8­ (1.97). For these world record attempts, Porter removed his sweater for the first time in the competition.  In the final, István Somodi (HUN) was the only competitor to improve on his qualifying mark in the morning.  Leahy, Somodi, and Géo André (FRA) had a jump-off for the silver and bronze medals, but none could equal their earlier marks so they were declared equal second.
After the Olympics, Harry Porter continued to be a top jumper.  He led the 1909 world lists with 6-4 (1.93), and tied for first in 1911 at the AAU Meet, but he did not compete at the 1912 Olympics.

The opening heats were won by Shaparenko, Ladislav Souček of Czechoslovakia, and Jean-Pierre Burny of Belgium, while Hansen only survived to the next round after going through the repêchage. The Dane made up for this in the semi-finals, however, by setting an Olympic record, while the other heats were won by Csapó and Shaparenko. The final developed into a dash towards the finish line between Peterson and Shaparenko, which the latter won in Olympic record time, albeit by a margin of only 0.29 seconds, to claim gold. Peterson settled for silver while Csapó came in just over a second latter to take bronze. Hansen, meanwhile, struggled in the medal round and finished seventh in his fourth and final Olympics.

The tiebreakers were then, in order, 1) Number of Majority Placements, 2) Total Ordinals of Majority, 3) Total Ordinals, 4) Total Points.",na,"The favorites were the German pair of Marika Kilius and Hans-Jürgen Bäumler. They were World Champions in 1963 and had won six straight European titles – 1959-64. At the 1963 Worlds they had defeated the Soviet husband-wife pair of Lyudmila Belousova and Oleg Protopopov, and a few weeks before the Olympics, they narrowly defeated them again. The competition in Innsbruck was very close, but the Soviet couple won with five first placements, to four for the Germans. The bronze medal was awarded to Canadians Debbi Wilkes and Guy Revell, who also received a silver medal, and another bronze medal went to American brother-sister Vivian and Ron Joseph, who placed fourth in the Official Report. Follow that?
Shortly after the Innsbruck Olympics, it was revealed that Kilius/Bäumler had signed a professional contract prior to the event to perform with Holiday on Ice. This should have disqualified them as professionals, but strangely no definite action was initially taken against them by the IOC or the International Skating Union. A few weeks later they won the World Championships, defeating Belousova and Protopopov. It was felt that the West German Olympic Committee, lobbying the IOC for the 1972 Olympic bid, wanted to present themselves in the best possible manner and encouraged the German skaters to return their medals. The IOC formed a special sub-committee to examine the case, and the minutes of the Executive Committee note, “A special sub-committee under Ivar Vind had studied the case of the German figure skaters. They had been found ‘non-amateurs’. Willi Daume said that ‘The German NOC will do what is necessary.’”
At the 65th IOC session the IOC passed a resolution, which was printed in the Olympic Review, volume 95, page 39, from 15 August 1966 which stated, “We have received the silver medals back, and we will award them to the original third-place finishers. The bronze medals will be awarded to the original fourth-place finishers.” In January 1966, Kilius/Bäumler returned their silver medals to the IOC. Silver medals were awarded to Wilkes and Revell by Canadian IOC Member James Worrall during the 1967 Canadian Figure Skating Championships, while the Josephs received bronze medals from USOC President Tug Wilson at a small private ceremony at the Sheraton Hotel in Chicago, during the 1966 USA Figure Skating Championships. However, no action was ever taken by the ISU, who continued to list Kilius/Bäumler as silver medalists and World Champions in 1964.
However, the controversy did not end there. In 1987, the German NOC rather surreptitiously requested the return of the silver medals to Kilius and Bäumler, which was in keeping with the ISU ruling as well. They asked the IOC to do this, stating that it was known that other skaters had signed similar contracts in that era. At the 1987 IOC Session in Istanbul, the IOC approved this request and the Germans received new silver medals on 5 December 1987, when German NOC president Willi Daume presented replicas of the originals to Kilius and Bäumler on the German television show “Sportstudio”.
Contacted in the late 90s, Debbi Wilkes and Vivian Joseph knew nothing of this, and still thought the German pair had been disqualified. Wilkes and Revell kept their silver medals, in fact, Revell’s medal was buried with him after his death, and the Josephs kept their bronze medals. Thus four silver medals were eventually awarded in this event. The IOC lists did not change the standings for many years, but recognizing that two sets of silver medals have been awarded in this event, now list Kilius/Bäumler and Wilkes/Revell as =2nd and as silver medalists, and have the Josephs in 3rd place with bronze medals. The ISU has never changed the original rankings, continuing to list Kilius/Bäumler 2nd, Wilkes/Revell 3rd, and the Josephs 4th.
Over the next four years, Belousova and Protopopov would become the greatest pair in the world, and possibly ever to that time. They would again win gold in 1968. They wished to continue competing thru the 1972 Sapporo Olympics, but Soviet authorities ruled they were too old and shunted them to the side. In 1979, the Protopopovs defected to Switzerland and then joined professional ice shows, where they became one of the most popular attractions, continuing to skate and entertain into their 60s.

They crushed Czechoslovakia in the quarter-finals and easily dispatched the British team in the semis. They were met in the final by the Soviet Union, which had defeated the GDR in the semi-finals.

Colombia, with little heritage in the sport, claimed the South American qualifying spot while Spain created a minor upset by qualifying at the expense of Russia. South Africa, in line with their NOC’s policy, refused a qualifying spot based solely on their performance at the African Championships. In general the “big beasts” of women’s sevens comfortably made it to Rio.The format used saw 12 teams sorted into three pools of four teams. The top two teams in each pool were joined in the quarter-finals by the two third place teams with the best records.
At 11am on August 6, 2016 rugby finally re-entered the Olympic Games when Spain’s Patricia Garcia took the kick off in their game against France. The group stages would not provide the same level of excitement as the men’s tournament would do later in the week, with only Fiji’s victory over the USA upsetting the odds. The other notable result of the first phase was the shut out inflicted by 4th seeded Great Britain on 3rd seeded Canada which ensured that the British won the group.
The first three quarter-finals were each won by the more favoured side and all went relatively smoothly for the victors Australia, Canada and Great Britain. The final quarter-final was a very different affair. The powerful figure of New Zealand’s Portia Woodman sped in for a first-half try against the USA, but the Kiwis then spent the second half in desperate, sometimes short-handed, defence. They kept their line intact to ensure their survival in the tournament. The semi-finals followed an identical pattern to each other. The Antipodean pairing of Australia and New Zealand both took early leads against their Northern hemisphere rivals that could not be dented by their opponents. Woodman scored a hat-trick in New Zealand’s win over Great Britain to repeat the feat she had achieved in the pool game against Kenya.
The bronze medal match played immediately before the final saw Canada turn the tables on the British to record a resounding 33-10 victory with Ghislaine Landry contributing 18 of the points. Thus the final was played between the top two seeds and fierce trans-Tasman rivals, Australia and New Zealand. An early score by the New Zealanders was matched, in controversial fashion, by Australia when the referee awarded a try despite Emma Tanigato appearing to fumble the ball in the act of scoring. The Aussies took this piece of luck and built on it by cutting loose and scoring three more tries without reply. By the time New Zealand regained their composure their chances were gone although a late brace of tries gave the scoreboard a more respectable look for the team in black.
Despite Australia taking the gold medal it was New Zealand’s Woodman who emerged as the top try scorer with 10 (including the aforementioned pair of hat-tricks) and top points scorer despite not taking any kicks at goal. Colombia, the lowest ranked by far of all the qualifiers, shipped 161 points in the first four games without themselves once troubling the scoreboard operators. Their streak was eventually broken in the first minute in the 11-12th classification match but they still went down to a defeat by Kenya.

He was joined on the 1932 Norwegian ski jumping team by his brother Birger, who won the world championship in 1931, at only 19. Hans Beck, also a Kongsberg jumper and still only 20, and 19-year-old Kåre Walberg from Hamar completed the Norwegian team. It was a young team with lots of ski jumping talent. It is interesting to note that three of the four jumpers on the US team were born in Norway, Roy Mikkelsen also having been born in Kongsberg.
The lack of snow created big problems for the organizers, but due to strong efforts by driving snow into the jumping hill from locations higher up in the Adirondacks the ski jumping competition was organized as scheduled.
Beck made a perfect jump in the first round, 71.5 m., five meters longer than Birger Ruud in second place, and had a clear lead. Kongsberg-born Mikkelsen from the USA made a great effort, but was not able to land his 68.0 m. jump cleanly, fell and was injured, and had to withdraw from the second round. The Swede Sten Eriksson was in third place with a 65.5 m. jump, closely followed by Walberg, Sigmund Ruud, the winner of the Nordic combined jump competition Fritz Kaufmann, and the main US hope after Mikkelsen’s fall, Caspar Oimoen.
In the second round Beck tried to secure his gold medal without taking risks, and made a safe jump of 63.5 m. Birger Ruud saw his chance, gave all he had and made an excellent jump of 69.0 m., passing his club mate Beck by 1.1 points in the final classification. Walberg managed to narrowly pass Eriksson and secured a Norwegian triple. Oimoen satisfied the home crowd by producing the second best jump in the last round with 67.5 m. to place 5th.

They could not ignore China, however, who had finished first at the 2000 and 2008 Olympic Games, as well as the two most recent World Championships, and still had many multiple World Championship titleholders amongst its ranks. The teams from the Germany and the United States, which had won bronze medals at the 2010 and 2011 World Championships respectively, were seen as strong contenders for the final podium spot.
The qualification round took a surprising twist, with the United States coming out on top and Japan and China finishing fifth and sixth respectively. The home team impressed as well, with Great Britain finishing third behind Russia. Germany in fourth rounded out the top six while Ukraine and France nabbed the last two spots for the final. In the race for the medals, the United States lost the steam it had had in the qualifications and sank to fifth place by the end of the competition. Ukraine and Great Britain battled to gain a solid grasp on the final podium spot, with the home nation coming out on top and setting themselves up to take home their first team medal in men’s gymnastics since 1912, when Great Britain had finished third. China had already guaranteed itself the gold medal and, with Japan in second place and only Uchimura left with an apparatus (the pommel horse), that nation seemed poised for the silver. Uchimura tumbled from the pommel horse during his dismount, however, and his team suffered for it, being dragged down into fourth place and surrendering the silver medal to Great Britain. This would have been only the second time British gymnastics had won silver, and the first since Walter Tysall’s placement in the 1908 individual all-around. The Japanese team launched an inquiry into Uchimura’s score, however, claiming that he was penalized too harshly for his dismount, and won the appeal. The judges raised his total by 0.7, enough to bump the nation back into silver medal position. This sent the home team back to bronze and knocked Ukraine off the podium entirely, an unfortunately dramatic end to an otherwise rousing competition.

She had emerged as dominant in the event in the previous season, and had won all 15 World Cup races she had contested since then. In addition, she had won the 2017 World title, and the 2017 World Sprint Championships. The Korean public hoped that Lee Sang-Hwa might be able to challenge her, and win her third Olympic 500 m title after 2010 and 2014. Behind Kodaira and Lee, the field was considered to be quite open, with Vanessa Herzog, Karolína Erbanová and Angelina Golikova featuring in many medal predictions. The 2014 silver medalist, Olga Fatkulina, would have been among these names, but was one of the Russians not invited for the Olympics, due to her being mentioned by the Oswald Commission (despite the fact she was later exonerated by CAS).
By the time Kodaira took to the ice, the leading time (37.53) had been produced by Brittany Bowe, but Kodaira was not impressed by that, and lowered it by almost six tenths of a second to 36.94. This brought down the Olympic Record (previously 37.30) by a massive margin as well. In her slipstream, Erbanová finished in 37.34, also below Bowe’s mark. Lee then mounted a serious attempt at retaining her gold, opening in 10.20 (the fastest of the field), but it was insufficient to beat Kodaira’s mark (37.33), and only barely faster than Erbanová. In the final pair, Herzog launched a last attempt to break into the medal positions, but unsuccessfully. Kodaira’s gold medal was the first in speed skating for a Japanese woman, and only the second total (the first one by Hiroyasu Shimizu). Erbanová was only the second Czech speed skater to medal in the Olympics, after Martina Sáblíková.

The 1992 title was again expected to be contested between these two superpowers of the sport. Before competition started the Germans suffered a setback when Germany II’s pilot Horst Czudaj was accused of spying on his team mates for the East German security forces in the late eighties. Although he was eventually cleared to compete, the controversy appeared to affect his concentration and he finished no higher than sixth.
The struggle for the Olympic gold was intense but it was neither a German or Swiss crew that stood on the top step of the podium at the end of the second day. Ingo Appelt and Austria I had been third in the 1990 World Championships but was not expected to challenge for the gold in Albertville.  The Austrians made up for a poor second run by producing three excellent ones and had just 0.02 of a second to spare when they crossed the line.
Canada II’s Olympic adventure ended in high farce. It was true that they crossed the line safely enough on the third run but without twenty-five percent of their crew. Jack Pyc had slipped at the start, failed to get into the bob and slid around several corners before coming to a halt. The team were disqualified. A similar fate nearly befell a Unified Team crew member as he also slipped attempting to enter his sled.  Oleksandr Bortiuk did make it into the bob albeit facing in the opposite direction to which he intended.

With three World titles in total (2012, 2014, 2015), Gray’s last defeat in a World Championship match was in 2013 to Zhang Fengliu of China, who went on to win that year’s title but had struggled since then. Gray was favoured to become the first American woman to win an Olympic wrestling gold medal.
Not to be discounted was the experienced two-time Olympic medalist Gyuzel Manyurova of Kazakhstan (2004 silver, 2012 bronze). Also fancied was Canada’s Erica Wiebe, who arrived in Rio world-ranked No. 2, despite just a handful of Grand Prix wins, and had yet to reach the podium at the World Championships.
Gray went out of the competition much earlier than expected when “something” was missing in her quarter-final match against Vasilisa Marzalyuk of Belarus who Gray has dominated in the past, but lost 4-1 on this occasion.
Ultimately, it was the rookie (Wiebe) and the veteran (Manyurova) who would meet in the gold medal match. The Canadian Wiebe, in her Olympic début, did not concede a single point in either the semi-final or final. She dominated the 38-year old Kazakh Manyurova, winning by a score of 6-0, after beating Marzalyuk, Zhang and Germany’s Maria Selmaier earlier in the day. Canada has never missed the podium since women’s wrestling made its Olympic début in Athens in 2004. With this Olympic title, Wiebe followed in the footsteps of her countrywomen, two-time Olympic medalist Carol Huynh, (2008 gold, 2012 bronze) and three-time Olympic medalist Tonya Verbeek (2004 and 2012 silvers, 2008 bronze).
Bronze medals went to Zhang, who defeated Wiebe’s semi-final opponent Marzalyuk 8-4 in the first of the bronze medal matches, while the other went to Yekaterina Bukina of Russia who defeated Laure Ali of Cameroon 5-3, thus depriving of Cameroon of their first ever wrestling medal, male or female.

Ties broken by lightest bodyweight.,na,"Zhou Lulu of China, the world record holder in total points, reigning World Champion, and silver medalist at the 2011 Asian Championships, was the favorite to take gold in the women’s super-heavyweight weightlifting event at the 2012 Summer Olympics. Close on her heels was Tatyana Kashirina of Russia, world record holder in the snatch, World Champion in 2010 and runner-up in 2009 and 2011, and European Champion for the last four years. Both would have to contend with Jang Mi-Ran of South Korea who, as the defending Olympic Champion and silver medalist in 2004, held all the Olympic records. Jang was also the 2010 Asian Games Champion and World Champion from 2005 through 2009, although she had strayed somewhat from her peak form since then. Another notable competitor was Ele Opeloge of Samoa who, in 2008, had finished fourth in the event, the highest placement ever for an Olympian representing her nation.
The competition boiled down to an exchange of Olympic and World records between Zhou and Kashirina. Zhou first set an Olympic record with 142 kg, followed by Kashirina’s 144 kg lift, then Zhou’s 146 kg attempt (which took two tries). The Russian then used her next two turns to reset her own world record twice – first with 149 kg, then with 151 kg. By the end of the snatch both were untouchable, as the next highest lift came from Mariam Usman of Nigeria, 2008 African Champion and bronze medalist at the most recent World Championships, and it was only 129 kg. The clean and jerk portion played out similarly: Zhou set an Olympic record for total lift and Kashirina bested it by setting a world record of 332. Zhou then set an Olympic record in the clean and jerk with a 187 kg lift and upped the world record for total points to 333. The Russian was unable to respond and remained in second place, with Zhou still having one lift remaining. Now guaranteed gold, Zhou attempted 190 kg, more than sufficient to set a world record in the clean and jerk, but was unsuccessful. Meanwhile, after Usman was unable to lift 160 kg in three attempts, therefore failing to post a score, the bronze medal went to Hripsime Khurshudyan of Armenia, who had been fourth in the snatch and lifted the highest total, after Zhou and Kashirina, in the clean and jerk with 166 kg. Khurshudyan was normally a heavyweight competitor, the division in which she earned a world bronze medal in 2009, and had a slew of European medals, including bronze in 2010, silver in 2006, 2009, and 2011 (in the super-heavyweight), and gold in 2007.
That was how the event and the results seemed to have ended. In 2015, however, the IOC began re-testing samples from the 2008 Beijing and 2012 London Olympics, using newer, more advanced testing techniques, in an effort to find those who had used performance enhancing drugs (PEDs), but in whom it could not be detected at the time of those Olympics. This was one of the many events affected. Every women’s weightlifting event at the 2012 London Olympics, except flyweight (≤ 48 kg), was affected by positive re-tests.
In November 2016 original bronze medalist Hripsime Khurshudyan (ARM) tested positive for turinabol (dehydrochloromethyltestosterone) and stanozolol, was disqualified, and lost her bronze medal, which was re-assigned to Korea’s Jang Mi-Ran. Khurshudyan’s re-tested sample from the 2008 Beijing Olympics was also positive for stanozolol and she was disqualified in that event as well.

The heavy favourite was Janja Garnbret, who won the combined title at the last two World Championships (2018-19), as well as the last four combined World Cups (2016-19), and the 2017 European Championships. The reigning 2020 European champion was Viktoriya Meshkova, but Garnbret did not compete then. Also participating on home soil in Tokyo was Akiyo Noguchi, silver medallist at the 2019 Worlds, two-time World Cup combined winner (2008-09) and six times runner-up (2010, 2013, 2015-16, and 2018-19). Other good combined climbers in the field were Shauna Coxsey, bronze medallist at the 2019 Worlds and third in the 2017 World Cup, Jessica Pilz, bronze medallist at the 2018 Worlds and third in the 2016 and 2019 World Cup, and the second Japanese competitor, Miho Nonaka, who was third in the 2018 World Cup.
The first part of the qualifying was the speed, which was won by Aleksandra Mirosław in an Olympic record 6.97 seconds, narrowly missing the world record of 6.96 seconds held by Yuliya Kaplina (RUS). Second place went to Anouck Jaubert, and third to Song Yiling while Garnbret, in her weakest discipline, placed 14th. In the next part, bouldering, Garnbret showed her skills as she was the only athlete to top all four routes while more than a third of the participants did not even make one top. Next to Garnbret were Brooke Raboutou and Noguchi with three tops each, followed by Coxsey, Seo Chae-Hyun, and Meshkova with two tops each. As a result, Garnbret led with 14 points after two events, followed by Mirosław (20) and Raboutou (24). The last part was the lead, which was won by the youngest climber in the field, 17-year-old Seo. She was the reigning Asian champion (2019) in lead, and also the World Cup winner in lead that same year, but she only received her Olympic ticket thanks to a re-allocated spot. Second to her was Pilz, with Nonaka third. This finish secured Pilz a place in the final after being only 14th after the first two events.
In the final, Mirosław again won the speed element, setting a new world record 6.84 seconds in the process. Jaubert was again in second place, followed by Nonaka, who was also the third best of those who made the final in the speed qualification. Only Garnbret improved from being seventh best in speed of the finallists to fifth, and then in the bouldering she was in a class of her own, topping two of the three routes. She was the only athlete in the final to top a route. A long way behind were Raboutou in second place and Nonaka third.
After the first two elements, Garnbret was in the lead with five points followed by Mirosław (eight), Nonaka (nine), Jaubert (12), Raboutou (14), and Noguchi (16). In the lead part, Garnbret started as fifth and took a clear lead ahead of Noguchi, and when Nonaka, who was placed third at that time, was not able to overtake Garnbret, the gold medal was secured for the Slovenian favourite. With two more athletes to come, the other medals were still not decided. The next was Pilz, who could have gone for silver if she had finished first, but she managed to place second, which, at the time was good enough for bronze and had already guaranteed the silver for Nonaka. The last starter was Seo, who could have gone for bronze if she finished first. She “only” finished second, however, behind Garnbret, but with this result she deprived Pilz of a medal, and Pilz and Seo finished next-to-last and last respectively after both being in the running for a medal. Noguchi (4x4x4) and Mirosław (1x8x8) finished level on 64 points but, as the Japanese had beaten the Pole in two of the three events, bronze went to Noguchi.

This division was one of the few women’s classes in which China had not been a dominant force in the past, having won only one medal, thanks to the gold medal of Yang Xia back in 2000 when women’s weightlifting was first held at the Olympic Games. In Tokyo, however, there was a clear favourite in Liao Qiuyun who had a season best of 222 kg. She was the reigning 2019 world champion and also the Asian champion in 2019 and 2020 (held in April 2021). Furthermore, she was the world record holder in clean & jerk (129 kg) and total (227 kg), both set at the 2019 World Championships. World record holder in snatch (102 kg), Li Yajun, was the 2018 world champion, and silver medallist at the last Asian Championships, where she set her season best with 221 kg. She represented China in the 53 kg class at Rio but, along with Zhang Wanqiong, twice runner-up at the 2018 and 2019 World Championships, both were not able to compete in Tokyo because of the one athlete per nation in each weight class rule. Liao’s first likely contender was Hidilyn Diaz, the 53 kg Rio silver medallist, who was competing in her fourth Olympics in Tokyo. She was the gold medallist from the 2018 Asian Games, when China was suspended, and was runner-up at the 2019 Asian Championships, but with a season best of 212 kg achieved at the Asian Championships held in April 2021, she was still ranked behind Muattar Nabieva. Nabieva finished third in the last two Asian Championships and had her season best with 213 kg. Also present in Tokyo was Zulfiya Chinshanlo, who lost her London 2012 gold medal due to doping, which was not discovered until October 2016. She did not have any significant results since then, having won her last world title back in 2014, placing fourth in the last Worlds and fifth in the last Asians, respectively. She went to Tokyo with a season best of 210 kg. Asian lifters dominated this event as only two non-Asians qualified through the rankings, Kamila Konotop (UKR), season best 212 kg, reigning European champion and World Junior champion, and also Ana López (MEX), season best 200 kg, and reigning Pan American champion.
As expected, the strongest snatcher in the field, Nabieva, took the lead after lifting 98 kg on her third attempt and Liao followed close behind with 97 kg. Diaz also gave a great performance by managing 97 kg with her second lift. She also tried 99 kg but failed to clear that weight. Konotop cleared 94 kg to bring herself in fourth position while Chinshanlo and Kristina Şermetowa followed with 90 kg each. In clean & jerk, Nabieva put in a good performance by her standard, lifting 114 kg for a total of 212 kg. She had a clear lead before the top three clean & jerkers started their competition after all the others had already finished. Liao started with 118 kg with her first lift, but Diaz countered with 119 kg. Chinshanlo started with 123 kg, which she cleared in her second attempt, and it brought all three ahead of Nabieva and secured a medal for them. Liao lifted 123 kg in her second attempt, but this was again countered by Diaz with 124 kg. This gave Chinshanlo bronze, but the race for gold was not over. Again, Liao started with a 126 kg, which meant that Diaz had to lift 127 kg in her last attempt as Liao had the lighter body weight. For the third time Diaz fought back and cleared 127 kg to win gold leaving silver for Liao, who was the only lifter in this field who did not miss any of her six attempts. This was also the first ever gold medal for the Philippines in Olympic history. The silver medal in this class would later turn out to be the only non-gold medal in weightlifting for China at these Games.
The Olympic Standard for Olympic records was 97 kg for snatch, 121 kg for clean & jerk, and 217 kg for total. The snatch record was taken by Nabieva with 98 kg. Liao twice set an Olympic record in clean & jerk with 123 kg and 126 kg, but it was bettered twice by Diaz with 124 kg and 127 kg. The same happened to the total record, where Liao established records with 220 kg and 223 kg only to the bettered by Diaz with 221 kg and 224 kg.

Of the medallists from Rio only Pavlo Tymoshchenko participated again. As the World Championships are an annual event, there had been four editions since Rio (the 2020 event was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic), with the champions being Jeong Jin-Hwa (2017), Jamie Cooke (2018), Valentin Belaud (2019), and Ádám Marosi (2021). The 2021 Worlds were held in June, less than two months before the Olympics, with the other medallists being Aleksandr Lifanov (silver) and Ahmed El-Gendy (bronze). Lifanov (2014) and El-Gendy (2018) had also been the gold medallists at the last two Youth Olympic Games. The leader of the world rankings just before the Games was Marosi, followed by Valentin Prades and Jeon Ung-Tae.
The traditional fencing round-robin was contested on the first day. Joe Choong and Lifanov took the lead with 25 wins each, and behind them were Illia Palazkov and Justinas Kinderis, each with 24 wins. After a break of one day the competition, was continued with the 200 m swimming, which was won by Amro El-Geziry in a time of 1:52.96. The Britons Cook, Olympic record holder in swimming in a 50 m pool in modern pentathlon, and Choong finished second and third. After the following bonus round in fencing, Choong was in the lead with 573 points, with Jeong Jin-Hwa second (554) and Palazkov third (552). The riding element was eagerly awaited, particularly after the dramatic events in the women’s competition the previous day. The best riders were Patrick Dogue, Gustav Gustenau, and Martin Vlach who all collected the maximum of 300 points. The leader Choong showed a solid performance after being drawn with Clntino, the same horse that help compatriot Kate French win gold the day before. Choong was still in the lead after three events with 859 points, and Jeong Jin-Hwa remained second (847 points) and was followed by Jan Kuf (838).
The scored points were converted into times and gave the following gaps for the laser-run: Choong started 12 seconds in front of Jeong Jin-Hwa, while Kuf was another nine seconds behind. Jeon Ung-Tae (+0.28) led the rest of the field with the other athletes close behind with a distance of a few seconds from each other. After the second shooting, Choong was still in the lead followed by Kuf and the two Koreans. Already in fifth position was El-Geziry who started 13th with +0:50 behind Choong. At the 2000 m split Choong was about six seconds ahead of a group consisting of Kuf, El-Gendy, Jeon Ung-Tae, and Jeong Jin-Hwa. Up to the last shooting Choong had controlled the race when El-Gendy caught up the Briton and overtook him. Choong, however, was able to fight back and with a 300 m spurt to the finish line secured the gold medal five seconds in front of El-Gendy. The battle for bronze was a fight between the two Koreans, who had stayed close together for a long time during the race, with the better finish for Jeon Ung-Tae, who was able to make up the 16 seconds his compatriot Jeong Jin-Hwa led him by at one stage, to finally win bronze, four seconds ahead. The best performance in the laser-run was by Vlach with a total time of 10:30.13 to finish fifth overall.
Choong won the first ever individual modern pentathlon medal for Great Britain. El-Gendy, who was the youngest ever competitor in this event, also won the sport’s first ever medal for Egypt, as well as for the continent of Africa, and Jeon Ung-Tae won South Korea’s first ever medal in this sport.

Bruce Baumgartner came to Los Angeles with his previous only international medal a silver at the 1983 Pan American Games, but he was helped by the absence of the Eastern Bloc wrestlers. There were only eight entrants in this class and Baumgartner only had to win three matches to take the gold medal, defeating Canadian Bob Molle in the final, winning on superiority, 10-2. Molle’s mere Olympic participation was heroic in itself, as he had back surgery on a herniated disc only 10 days before the 1984 Opening Ceremony.
Although Baumgartner was somewhat lightly regarded in 1984 by the international wrestlers, he would become one of the two greatest super-heavyweights over the next decade. His rivalry with Soviet Georgian Davit Gobejishvili became legendary, with Gobejishvili winning the gold medal at Seoul in 1988, defeating Baumgartner in the final match. Baumgartner won a second Olympic gold in 1992, Gobejishvili taking bronze in Barcelona. Baumgartner continued to compete and won a fourth Olympic medal in 1996, taking bronze in Atlanta, which made him only the sixth wrestler to win four or more Olympic medals. He was World Champion in 1986, 1993, and 1995, while Gobejishvili won that title in 1985 and 1990.

Year rankings had been dominated by the Soviet women, but in 1948 the USSR still refused to compete at the Olympics, albeit for the last time. This prevented Nina Dumbadze, European Champion and unofficial World Record holder with a 50-metre-throw, from competing. A week after the Olympic final, she would shatter the World Record officially by nearly 5 metres. By contrast, the 41.92 (137-6½) winning throw by Micheline Ostermeyer seems like a mediocre performance. But considering that Ostermeyer had only entered the event because she was so versatile, and had already qualified for two other events, it can be considered remarkable. The Frenchwoman was also a great concert pianist, which was much harder for her than sports: )I practise five hours a day on the piano, and five hours a week for athletics), she once noted.

The event was scheduled to start at 4:30 PM (1630) on Sunday afternoon, with no qualifying held on Saturday. The Americans claimed that the French told them that any field event final which was contested on Sunday would not be considered finished until the Americans had a chance on the next day to better the marks posted. This was apparently ruled at a meeting on Wednesday, 11 July. But on Saturday night, the French ruled that the results of all Sunday events would be final, with no recourse to any athletes who did not compete due to Sabbatarian objections. Apparently the Americans were not told of this decision.
The top American vaulters were Charles Dvorak, Daniel Horton, and Bascom Johnson. They were not at the field on Sunday when the pole vault started. Fortunately for the American team, Irv Baxter, who had just won the high jump (which started at 3:45 PM [1545]), and Meredith Colket, were present and were able to compete in the vault.  They took the first two places without much difficulty.
On Monday, Bascom Johnson, in a special event organized by the French authorities to assuage the angry American authorities, cleared 3.38 metres.  But it had no bearing on the Olympic championship. On Thursday, 19 July, the pole vault handicap was held and was won by Jakab Kauser of Hungary. But the Americans were still protesting the Sunday competition, so again a special pole vault competition, at scratch, was organized. In this event, Dan Horton cleared 3.45 metres, and Charles Dvorak was second with 3.35. It mattered little as the French never changed their ruling and the listing below is the accepted one.  The 1900 Olympic pole vault champion remained Irving Baxter.

The undoubted favourite was Hungary’s László Papp who was attempting to become the first three-time Olympic boxing champion, having already won at middleweight in 1948 and light-middleweight in 1952. Standing between Papp and his goal were the European champion Zbigniew Pietrzykowski of Poland and the brilliant young Puerto Rican-American soldier José Torres. Papp used his experience to befuddle his much younger opponents and outpointed Pietrzykowski in the semi-finals then comfortably defeating Torres in the final to claim his piece of history.
Uniquely for a fighter from a communist country Papp was allowed to turn professional on his return home from Australia. After an eight year pro career in which he remained unbeaten, he was on the verge of a shot at the world title when the Hungarian authorities decided that boxing for pay was “incompatible with socialist principles” and forced his retirement. José Torres went on to win the world professional light-heavyweight title in 1965 and in retirement became one of the professional sport’s leading officials. The two bronze medalists also made their mark on the sport. Pietrzykowski won medals at the next two Olympics whilst John McCormack became European middleweight champion as a pro.

Early in the season, Johann Olav Koss had broken the world record in this distance on the Olympic ice, skating 6:35.53, well ahead of his Dutch rivals. But at the European Championships, also skated at the Olympic rink in Hamar, Koss had not been in great shape, and had placed only fourth, with Rintje Ritsma winning. The Dutch had also prepared a )secret weapon) for the Olympics, a new aerodynamic cover for the skates. It was officially called the delta skate, but went by other nicknames such as the )condom skate) or FTN-skate ()F*** the Norwegians) skate). Used only by Ritsma, the new skate was not very successful, and it would never be used again in competition.
The first contender to race was Kjell Storelid, a Norwegian. He had only once placed on the World Cup podium (in January 1994), but had been a consistent top 10 skater at the distance. Cheered on by his compatriots, he skated the best race of his life with 6:42.68. This seemed beatable by 1993 World Champion Falko Zandstra, but he faded badly late in the race and ended at 6:44.58. Then, it was Koss, who started with his own world record schedule in mind. Skating incredibly flat - all laps were between 30.86 and 32.01 - Koss beat his own mark by half a second: 6:34.96. Two pairs later, Ritsma attempted a do-or-die race. Starting faster than the Norwegian, his splits were over two seconds faster at 1,800 m. But his fast pace cost him dearly, and Ritsma eventually wound up in third place with 6:43.94, well above his own best time.
