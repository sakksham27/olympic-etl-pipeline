Best six of seven scores to count for final placement.,na,"The 6-metre class had first been held at the 1908 Olympics, and was on every Olympic yachting program from 1908-52, but it was discontinued after the Helsinki Olympics, as the trend was to smaller Olympic boats. The event was raced on a 13.1 nautical mile (24.2 km) course, the same as for all the larger boats in Helsinki.
American Herman Whiton and Llanoria had won this event in 1948, and he returned to defend his gold medal, although with a different crew, this one including his wife, Emelyn. After six races, Llanoria was far behind the Norwegian boat Elisabeth X, but the Americans won the final race and Norway finished only fifth, to bring Whiton the title. The third-placed Finnish boat, Ralia, had also placed third in 1948, but was then raced by Sweden and was called Ali Baba.

56018,"110 metres Hurdles, Men",1896 Summer Olympics,1,Athletics,/editions/1/sports/ATH,7 – 10 April 1896,"Panathinaiko Stadio, Athina",8 from 6 countries,na,na,"A misprint in the 1896 Official Report has led some to believe that the distance was 100 metres. But there is little doubt that the race was contested over the standard distance of 110 metres. There was no real favorite, as the two top hurdlers in the world, Stephen Chase (USA) and Godfrey Shaw (GBR), elected not to make the trip. The Greeks felt their champion, Anastasios Andreou of Cyprus, was unbeatable. The British hurdler, Grantley Goulding, paraded around Athens wearing his medals on his coat, causing his American rival, Tom Curtis, to remark, “I never met a more confident athlete.”
Though four heats were scheduled, only two were contested, and they were held on 7 April. Goulding won the first heat easily in 18.4 over France’s Frantz Reichel, Hungary’s Alajos Szokoly, and Andreou. There was some controversy over the finish of Reichel and Szokoly, and who would be advanced to the final, but eventually Reichel was chosen by the jury. Curtis won the second heat in 18.0 over his teammate Bill Hoyt, Greece’s Athanasios Skaltsogiannis, and Germany’s Kurt Doerry.
Reichel and Hoyt, though qualified, elected not to contest the final on 10 April, and Szokoly, despite the controversy of heat one, was not chosen for the final, leaving only Goulding and Curtis to race for the championship. Hoyt most likely withdrew to concentrate on the pole vault. Reichel did not start because he was seconding Lermusiaux in the marathon race, held concurrently with the hurdle final. Goulding was noted to be a better technical hurdler but Curtis was much the faster runner. Goulding led at the last hurdle but lost on the run-in by centimetres, with Curtis timed in 17 3/5 seconds.

But the US had posted some fast times early in 2004 and was a slight favorite. Jamaica took the early lead but Marion Jones, 100/200 champion from 2000, ran the second leg for the US, though she was not the runner she had been in 2000. And on the second baton pass, she and 2005 100 metre World Champion Lauryn Williams ran out of the exchange zone and the US team pulled up. This left the way open for Jamaica, which won quite easily over Russia, France winning the bronze medal.

1936,"15 kilometres, Men",1964 Winter Olympics,37,Cross Country Skiing,/editions/37/sports/CCS, 2 February 1964 — 9:30,"Langlaufstadion, Seefeld",71 from 21 countries,na,Course Length: ?Height Differential: 192 mIntermediate 1: 5.0 kmIntermediate 2: 10.0 kmMaximum Climb: 68 mTotal Climbing: 492 m,"The 15 km race was contested three days after the opening 30 km cross country race. The Swede Assar Rönnlund, placing seventh on the opening distance, had been World Champion at 15 km in 1962, closely followed by three Norwegians, all of them on the Norwegian 1964 Olympic team for the distance: Harald Grønningen, Einar Østby and Magnar Lundemo. But the recent 30 km Olympic Champion, Eero Mäntyranta was also considered the top favorite in this event.
At the 5 km checkpoint, Mäntyranta was already in the lead, 12 seconds ahead of countryman Kalevi Lauria, with Grønningen and Rönnlund following closely in third and fourth place. At 10 km Mäntyranta was still in the lead, but Grønningen had advanced to second place, only 11 seconds behind and 7 seconds ahead of Laurila in third place. Rönnlund had dropped from fourth to tenth position, but two other Swedes, Sixten Jernberg and Janne Stefansson had advanced to fourth and fifth, only one and two seconds behind Laurila.
In the final 5 km Mäntyranta increased his speed and won his second Olympic gold medal, 40.7 seconds ahead of Grønningen. Jernberg would collect his seventh Olympic medal coming in third, closely followed by Väinö Huhtala, like Mäntyranta also a member of the Finnish gold winning relay team from 1960. Stefansson could hold his fifth place, only one second behind Huhtala, and Laurila, as in the 30 km, faded at the end and dropped down to ninth position. Best of the Middle Europeans was an Italian, the 22-year-old customs official Franco Nones, who would have his Olympic day of glory four years later.

The official world record was 1.58 (5-2 7/16), set by Canadian Ethel Catherwood in 1926. At the Canadian Championships earlier in 1928, Catherwood had also cleared 1.60 (5-3), but this would not be ratified as a record. The day after that clearance, Lien Gisolf (NED) jumped 1.58 (5-2¼) in Bruxelles to equal the listed world record. The event would come down to these two and American Mildred Wiley. The three were clear thru 1.51 (4-11½) metres, but at 1.54 (5-0½) metres, Catherwood went over on her first attempt while Gisolf and Wiley required two jumps. The same was true at 1.56 (5-1¼) metres, with all three still jumping at 1.58 (5-2¼), but Catherwood won the gold medal when only she could clear that height. She then succeeded on her third attempt at 1.60 (5-3) to break the world record; however, the bar was re-measured for record purposes, and the final mark was given as 1.595 metres (5-2¾).
There was a jump-off for silver/bronze between Gisolf and Wiley, with Gisolf winning silver, although details are not known. There was also a jump-off for 4th through 10th place among seven jumpers, with Jean Shiley clearing 1.51 metres to take fourth, although further details are unavailable.

Russia had come to Sochi looking for multiple medals in biathlon but had struggled. The team’s benefactor was Russian billionaire Mikhail Prokhorov, who owned the NBA’s Brooklyn Nets, but as the Games neared their end, Prokhorov said he would resign as President of the Russian Biathlon Union if they did not improve their performance. And that they did by winning the final biathlon gold medal of the Sochi Olympics in the men’s relay.
Norway took the early lead, with the brothers Tarjei Bø and Johannes Thingnes Bø leading after the first two legs. Russia was third, as Germany’s Erik Lesser moved his team into second. It had been a very disappointing Winter Olympics for the German biathletes, but Daniel Böhm held onto second after the second leg. Norwegian biathlon legend, Ole Einar Bjørndalen, looking for his record 14th Winter Olympic medal, skiied the third leg, and shot cleanly. But his skiing was slower than usual, and Arnd Peiffer moved Germany only 2 seconds back, with Russia another 15 seconds behind. Norway’s anchor leg was Emil Hegle Svendsen, who had won gold in Sochi in the mass start race, but had been sick throughout the Games. He shot very poorly on his leg, missing four targets and dropped completely off the podium as they would finish fourth.
The gold and silver medals came down to a race between the Russian and German anchor skiiers – Anton Shipulin and Simon Schempp. Schempp shot better, needing only 2 extra shots to hit all his targets, to Shipulin’s 4, but he could not match Shipulin’s speed over the snow and Shipulin came home in front by 3.5 seconds. Austria won the bronze medal, almost 30 seconds back, with Norway well behind in fourth.
And that was how the results stood until February 2020, when the International Biathlon Union (IBU) disqualified Yevgeny Ustyugov (RUS) after a re-test of samples from 2013 revealed the presence of oxandrolone. As a result, Ustyugov was stripped of all his results from  the 2013-14 season and was disqualified from all five events in which he competed at Sochi. His relay disqualification cost Russia the gold medal. As of July 2020, no upgrade of medals has been announced by the IOC. Ustyugov has an appeal pending with the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) as of October 2021, who announced the decision on this will be delayed until 2022.

The favorites were the big five of women’s cross-country over the last few years – Russians Lyubov Yegorova, Yelena Välbe, and Larisa Lazutina and Italians Manuela Di Centa and Stefania Belmondo. Di Centa, Yegorova, and Valbe were currently in a tight battle for the 1993-94 World Cup title, with Di Centa eventually winning it, while Välbe had won the last two World Championships at the distance. There were 54 starters and the favorites all went off from starting position 43 to 52. But right from the start, Di Centa set the fastest pace and she would win fairly easily, almost by 19 seconds over Yegorova. Belmondo, Lazutina, and Välbe placed 4-5-6 respectively, while the bronze medal went to Russian Nina Gavrylyuk. Di Centa would win five medals in all the cross-country events in Lillehammer, adding a gold in the 30 km to her victory in this event. Gavrylyuk was the least heralded of the Russians, and this was her only individual Olympic medal, but she would win three relay golds in her career – in 1988, 1994, and 1998.

The bronze medal went to Italy’s Franco Menichelli, one of only two men’s individual gymnastics medals won by Italy in 1960, the other going to Giovanni Carminucci, who won a silver on the parallel bars.

She began to show some of that future promise by winning her opening heat and the medal round with relative ease, becoming the youngest Olympic canoeing champion (she would later earn the title as the oldest in 2004). An even lesser-known Bulgarian, Vanya Gesheva, was never far behind Fischer and took the silver medal, although she had to battle the Soviet Union’s Antonina Melnikova for it, emerging victorious by only 0.18 seconds and leaving her challenger with bronze.

The defending gold medalist, American Rulon Gardner, who had recorded a stunning upset of Karelin in 2000, was back and had won the 2001 World Championships, but little else since. The final came down to Russian Khasan Baroyev, the 2003 World Champion, against Kazakh Georgy Tsurtsumia, who was unknown but had defeated Gardner in the semi-finals. Tsurtsumia led throughout the final, and was ahead 2-0 with less than a minute left, when Baroyev threw him for 4 points and won the gold medal, 4-2.

He had been especially dominant in the 2011/12 season when he won every major title available. Chan had to overcome the “Canadian men’s singles’ jinx” at the Olympics. Canadian male skaters Kurt Browning, Brian Orser, and Elvis Stojko had all come to the Olympics as a favorite or co-favorite but no Canadian man had ever won Olympic gold in singles competition.
Russian star Yevgeny Plyushchenko was the home favorite. He had not won a World title since 2004, and had struggled with back injuries and surgeries for the past few years. But Plyushchenko skated well in the team competition at Sochi, second only to Chan among the men, giving his fans hope. On the night of the short program, however, Plyushchenko warmed up, but then skated over to the side of the rink and withdrew with back pain. He would have another back surgery within weeks. Two other contenders were considered to be Kazakh Denis Ten, silver medalist at the 2013 Worlds, and Japan’s 2010 World Junior Champion Yuzuru Hanyu.
Hanyu took a surprising lead over Chan in the short program but it was very close and whoever won the free skate would likely take the gold medal. Spain’s Javier Fernández ranked third after the short, while Ten was in ninth place.
In the free skate Hanyu looked to have cost himself the gold medal when he fell on a quad salchow-triple flip combination. But Chan made some minor errors on a quad toe loop and triple axel and Hanyu won the free skate by just over ½-a-point, giving him the gold medal. Chan was second, continuing the Canadian jinx in the event, while Ten’s free skate moved him up to the bronze medal as Fernández dropped off the podium and placed fourth.
The top American Jason Brown, placed ninth, as no American singles skater stood on the Olympic podium for the first time since 1936. The top US skater, defending champion Evan Lysacek, had struggled with injuries all year and had not tried to make the American team at the trials.

Thus, if a skater was ranked first by a majority of the judges, that skater was placed first overall for that section.  Ties were broken by a Subsequent Majority rule, i.e., if the skaters were ranked for the same position by the same number of judges, Majority Placement for the next higher position for each skater determined who was ranked higher.  Final placement was determined by factored placements.  The tiebreakers were then 1) Number of Majority Placements, 2) Total Ordinals of Majority, 3) Total Ordinals.

Thomas was making history as the first great black figure skater at the Olympics. In the compulsories, Thomas placed second to Soviet Kira Ivanova, with Witt third, followed by Canada’s Liz Manley. Thomas also was second in the short program, won by Witt, but Thomas narrowly led going in to free skating – 2.0 to 2.2 factored placements. Manley was a solid third, but had to count on both Thomas and Witt stumbling in the free skate for her to win. Manley put on a great performance before the partisan Calgary crowd, and won the free skate, but it was not quite enough for gold. Witt skated solidly, if not spectacularly, and placed second, which brought her the gold medal. Thomas had difficulty in the free skating, falling on her first jump, and placed only fourth, which dropped her to the bronze medal. Though Witt and Manley would go on to professional ice shows, Thomas returned to Stanford, where she was a pre-medical student, and later became an orthopaedic surgeon. For Witt, an East German, it was unusual for her to be allowed to skate professionally, and she later toured for a time with Brian Boitano.

As the Rio Games approached, however, they seem to have been overtaken by Australia and then by the USA.
When the teams finally hit the track it became apparent this was to be a two horse race. Great Britain’s first ride saw them lower the world record, but the Americans were equally impressive and set the third best time ever to trail by just a fraction over a second. The next round saw the world record fall twice in consecutive heats. The Americans took a second off the record to reach the final, but the British went a tenth of a second faster again.
This set up the final to be a classic. The Americans started quickest, with Sarah Hammer leading the team out and opening an early lead of half a second as their British rivals took a while to get going partly because of their choice of enormous gears. At the 1750m mark, just short of the halfway point, the British finally overhauled their opponents and began to pull away. When the clock stopped on the British it read 4:10.236 and meant they had taken two more seconds from the world record. The American time was the fourth fastest ever and would have been an outright world record if set 20 hours earlier.

The silver medalist from the 30 km race, Rolf Rämgård, and Finland’s Kalevi Hämäläinen, World Champion at 30 km 1958, were also counted among the outsiders. Norway’s hopes relied on the winner of the 50 km at Holmenkollen in 1959, 26-year old Sverre Stensheim, but Stensheim, with his disappointing 20th place in the 30 km race, was apparently feeling uncomfortable in the Californian highlands, as parts of the track were over 2000 m above sea level.
Jernberg was in front at the 10 km mark, 23 seconds ahead of Hämäläinen, with Hakulinen and Rämgård in third place, another 10 seconds behind. Nikolay Anikin followed closely in fifth place. But at the halfway point, Jernberg was struggling and had dropped down to fourth place, over a minute behind the leading Hämäläinen. Hakulinen had advanced to second place 22 seconds back, and Rämgård was still in third position, closely behind Hakulinen. At 35 km Hämäläinen had widened the gap down to Hakulinen to 34 seconds, and Rämgård could not keep up with pace of the Finnish duo. Jernberg had dropped further down to sixth place, now over three and a half minutes behind the leader. In the last 15 km, Hakulinen tried hard to catch Hämäläinen, but the latter fought bravely and was able to cling to the lead. At the finish he was 20 seconds ahead of Hakulinen, as the Finnish duo had the fastest finish of all. Rämgård, in spite of losing two more minutes to the two Finns, secured the bronze medal ahead of the third fastest finisher, his countryman Lennart Larsson.  Jernberg also advanced on the final stage, finishing in fifth place. The race was totally dominated by the Finnish and Swedish skiers, both nations having three skiers each among the first six.

The first run started in late afternoon and the second run was held as a night-race under floodlights. The current slalom World Cup season saw Mikaela Shiffrin winning three races in Levi, Bormio, and Flachau, while Marlies Schild won in Courchevel and Lienz, and Frida Hansdotter topped the result in the last race before the Olympics in Kranjska Gora. This brought Shiffrin in the lead of the standings followed by Hansdotter, Marlies Schild, and Marie-Michèle Gagnon. Marlies Schild was the 2011 World champion and also won the slalom World Cup in 2010/11 and 2011/12 with Shiffrin as  reigning 2013 World chamipon and 2012/13 slalom World Cup winner. With her 35th career win in Lienz, Marlies Schild also overtook Vreni Schneider in the list of all-time slalom World Cup wins. So all was focused on a generational duel between the young 18-year-old superstar Mikaela Shiffrin and 32-year-old grand dame Marlies Schild.
In the opening run the early skiers would post the fastest times. Going first, the pace was set by Bernadette Schild (AUT) with a time of 53.41. This didn’t last long as Super Combined champion and Vancouver slalom gold medalist Maria Höfl-Riesch (GER) overtook this with 53.11. Two skiers later Tina Maze (SLO), Giant Slalom champion, set a time of 53.29 to challenge the leaders. But easily the fastest was Mikaela Shiffrin (USA) who skied the course in 52.62 to take a lead of almost half a second into the second run. Coming next with bib number 7 was Marlies Schild, but she lost more than 1.3 seconds and finished the first run only in sixth position.
With the top 30 going in reverse order in the second run, Frida Hansdotter (SWE) had the fourth fastest time down the course to finish with a combined time of 1:45.90. Next down the course was Kathrin Zettel, seventh after the first run but powering to the second fastest time on the second run to take the lead with 1:45.35. Sixth after the first run, Marlies Schild (AUT) then set the new target time of 1:45.07, having posted the fastest time on the second run with 51.11. Maze then had a poor second run to finish in 1:46.25, ultimately placing eighth. As the course deteriorated Höfl-Riesch was relatively slow and her combined time of 1:45.73 finish fourth. Going last, Shiffrin, despite a mistake on the course, when she almost fell backwards and had to recover, held her nerve with the sixth fastest time of the run, winning gold over the two Austrians by a margin of 0.53 seconds.
Shiffrin became the youngest ever Olympic slalom champion and her idol Marlies Schild became the first women to win a third medal in the same Alpine skiing event after silver in Vancouver and bronze in Torino. Skiing manufacturer Atomic, who did not win a single medal before this event, made a clean sweep of the podium.

In fact, the only World Championship medalists who were present in Los Angeles were Marioara Popescu-Ciobanu and Elisabeta Oleniuc of Romania, who were favorites to win gold. Canada, the reigning Pan American champions, sent sisters Danièle and Silken Laumann. These two nations met in the opening round, with Romania emerging victorious by a margin of nearly two and a half seconds, although both finished faster than Haldis Lenes and Solfrid Johansen of Norway, the other heat winners. Romania maintained its dominance in the final, winning gold by a comfortable margin, but the Dutch duo of Greet and Nicolette Hellemans, who had been behind Romania and Canada in the heats, snuck ahead of the Canadian sisters to steal silver. Canada, then, had to be content with bronze. Of all the medals, however, it was perhaps Oleniuc’s that was most noteworthy: under her married name of Lipă, she would go on to win seven more medals in five editions of the Olympic Games, making her the most decorated rower in the history of the sport.

Ortíz almost lasted two rounds, but received a standing eight-count with only three seconds left in round two, and his handlers threw in the towel, giving Whitaker the gold medal.

The surprise leader after the opening round was Britain’s Max Whitlock after a fine performance on the pommel horse that earned him 15.875. No Briton had won an individual all-round medal since Walter Tysall took silver in 1908. Uchimura was breathing down Whitlock’s neck, with 2013 World Championship silver medallist Ryohei Kato in third.
Another of the fancied gymnasts was Cuban’s 2015 world silver medallist Manrique Larduet, but a fall during the vault forced him to retire injured, as the lead changed hands with Uchimara taking top spot from Whitlock with Verniaiev moving into third. A great performance by the Ukrainian on the rings put him top of the leader board at the half-way stage, with Whitlock still hanging on to that silver medal position, but he dropped to third after the fourth rotation as the Japanese favourite moved into second.
Verniaiev cemented his position as leader in the fifth round with a 16.1 from an outstanding performance on the parallel bars and, going into the final round, the Ukrainian led the defending champion with 77.466 points to 76.565, with Whitlock third on 75.441.The Briton posted a 15.2 on the floor and then had to wait to see if he would be overtaken for that elusive medal by the Russian David Belyavsky, or the Chinese pair or Deng Shudi and Lin Chaopan. Lin’s floor exercise tally was less than Whitlock’s, as was Deng’s performance on the horizontal bar and, agonisingly for Belyavsky, he needed 15.260 on the bars for bronze, but fell marginally short with 15.13. Thus Whitlock won Britain’s first all-round medal in 108 years, and all eyes were now back onto the race for the gold medal.
Verniaiev led Uchimura by 0.901 points. The Japanese gymnast went first on the high bars and put in a dynamic performance and ended with 92,365 points. Verniaiev knew he needed 14.900 to take gold but he came up short with a 14.800 after a slight hop on landing. Thus he lost the title by less than 100th of a point as Uchimura became the first man since the legendary Sawao Kato in 1972 to successfully defend his title.

Top 5 teams after four rounds proceeded to final rounds.",na,"The team event was new to the Olympic Program, and it had not yet even been contested at the World Championships. The event was a mixed one, with each team having a male singles, female singles, pair, and dance couple skating both a short and long program. The skaters could change after the short program, thus a full team could consist of 12 skaters. Ten teams competed with scoring on a reverse point-for-place basis, with 10 points to the winner of each segment, down to 1 point for placing 10th. After all four disciplines skated a short program, the lowest five ranked teams were eliminated and the top 5 skated long programs in each of the four segments, with teams then receiving 10-9-8-7-6 points for their placements.
Russia dominated the event. During the Sochi Olympics they would win 3 of the 5 figure skating events, but the team trophy started it off. The first segment was men’s singles short program, which was led by Japan’s Yuzuru Hanyu, who would eventually win the gold medal in the men’s competition, but Russia’s Yevgeny Plyushchenko, skating despite significant back problems, finished second. And in the second segment, when the Russian pair of Tetiana Volosozhar and Maksim Trankov won, Russia was in a lead which they never relinquished. After that segment, the battle would remain only for the silver and bronze medals.
The three favorites for the medals had always been Russia, Canada, and the United States, but the United States started out very poorly, with their men’s skater, Jeremy Abbott, placing only seventh. Their pairs team of Marissa Castelli and Simon Shnapir was fifth, but the team remained in seventh after two segments, and there was some concern that the US would not make the cut after the short programs. This concern disssolved after the US eventual gold medal-winning dance couple of Meryl Davis and Charlie White won that segment, and moved the US into third place, trailing Russia and Canada.
And that was how the medals turned out. One problem with the event was that the scoring system did not allow for much movement up-or-down after the first few events, and the medals were basically determined after 6 of the 8 segments. There was discussion that the scoring system would have to be tweaked for future competitions, to make it more competitive and bring some drama to the final phases.

But before the competition started Kitajima became embroiled in a swimsuit controversy. Japanese swimming federation rules allowed swimsuits made by Japanese manufacturers to be used by the national team but team members were adamant that not using the new Speedo costumes would ruin their chances in Beijing. Some, including Kitajima, threatened to break ranks and wear the American-made costumes in defiance of the rules. The Japanese federation was forced to back down and allow the swimmers to use the new high tech suits.
Kitajima signaled his intentions by breaking the world record in a warm-up meet in June and was a clear favourite for the Olympic title on arrival in Beijing. His main rival proved not to be Hansen, who was not in the same form as previous years, but instead it was European champion Alexander Dale Oen of Norway. The Norwegian broke the Olympic record in both his heat and semi-final but the Japanese champion responded by breaking his own world record in the final to retain the Olympic final.
Dale Oen went on to win the World title in 2011 but his life came to a tragic end in May 2012. Shortly after training at altitude in Arizona he was discovered unconscious in his apartment shower, having suffered a cardiac arrest.

In heat two, American Abbey D’Agostino and New Zealander Nikki Hamblin tangled on the eighth lap backstretch, both falling to the track. D’Agostino, who had never before met Hamblin, turned around and went back to help her up, and they then continued running, more like hobbling, to the finish. Both were advanced to the final, although D’Agostino could not run, having torn her ACL in the fall. The video of the sportsmanship went viral on social media.
In the final Japan’s Miyuki Uehara took the early lead, but Ayana went to the front after four laps and then threw in a 65.8 lap at 2K, trying to break the field. She opened up three metres but Cheruiyot and Obiri slowly pulled her back in. Cheruiyot covered laps 11 and 12 in 65.2 and 64.7, distancing Ayana, who was also passed by Obiri. Cheruiyot won the gold by about 3½ seconds over Obiri, with Ayana almost 4 seconds back for the bronze.

Sheffield Speed Skating Oval, Lake Placid",18 from 6 countries,na,na,"Only North Americans made it through to the final in this event –  three Canadians and three Americans did qualify. The North Americans shut out Norwegian favourites Bernt Evensen and Hans Engnestangen in the first heat. The second heat began with an incredibly slow lap, as none of the skaters wanted to take the lead. A restart was ordered, but the pace changed little until the final lap. The third race was somewhat more exciting, with Sweden’s Ingvar Lindberg trying to break away from the pack. He was only caught at 150 m from the finish line, but was then overtaken by the entire field.
Alex Hurd took the lead on the first lap of the final, then swerved to the side to let 500 m champion Shea ahead. On the second lap, Ray Murray took over. The American faded on the final lap, being passed by Shea. Herb Taylor followed close-by in second, but tripped over an ice bump and fell. This left a comfortable lead for Shea, who won his second gold of the Games, followed by the three Canadians. After the race, the Norwegian delegation pointed out to the referee the rule that the time in the final of an event should be faster than the average of the heats contested. Shea’s time had been 10 seconds slower than the required average, but the referee chose to ignore this rule.
Jack Shea, who competed in the Lake Placid Olympics while on leave from Dartmouth College, would later become the patriarch of an Olympic family. His son Jim participated in the 1964 Olympics as a Nordic skier, while his grandson, Jim, Jr., competed in skeleton in 2002. Jack would not be there to see his grandson, as he killed in a collision with a drunk driver, shortly before the Salt Lake City Winter Olympics. Jim, Jr. first recited the Olympic oath like his grandfather had in 1932, and then won the gold medal, carrying a picture of him in his helmet. Active in the local administration of the town of North Elba, Shea was also involved in the organisation of the 1980 Winter Olympics in his home town of Lake Placid.

At the European Championships, the women ran 800 in both 1954 and 1958, both titles won by Soviet women. With an absence of races to choose from, no real favorite existed in 1960, but the Soviets were expected to be strong. The last five world records had been set by Soviet women, with Liudmyla Lysenko breaking the mark in July 1960. In the heats, Dixie Willis (AUS) had the fastest time with 2:05.9. She led the final as well, from the start until the final homestraight. But she stumbled on the curb and pulled off the track with only 50-70 metres remaining. The finish was close between Lysenko and Australia’s Brenda Jones, but Lysenko prevailed, equaling her world record in the process.
Willis would return in 1962 to win the Commonwealth Games title. Her official status in the 1960 800 metres has been listed in various ways, none of which appear to be correct. She is listed in the Official Report as “Scratched” but she definitely ran. Other sources list her as did not finish. In fact, a YouTube video shows the race, and she actually finished the race, in approximately 2:27, as, after stepping off the track, she came back on and jogged across the finish line. This has been investigated by discussions with Willis who states that after being clipped by another runner, she stepped off the curb onto the infield and stopped briefly, but did, in fact, finish the race and was never informed of any disqualification.

The event was held for the ninth time at the Olympics and saw a field of 36 shooters, which was the smallest ever. The field included the reigning 2018 World Champion Jin Jong-O and runner-up Artyom Chernousov, who had lost that title in a shoot-off. The leader of the world ranking just before the Games was Javad Foroughi, followed by Saurabh Chaudhary, gold medallist at the 2018 Summer Youth Olympics in this event, and Abhishek Verma. Not present was the world record holder for finals (246.5 points) Kim Song-Guk, as the People’s Democratic Republic of Korea (North Korea) did not send a team to Tokyo. His spot was re-allocated to the 2016 gold medallist Hoàng Xuân Vinh and, as the Rio silver medallist Felipe Wu earned a spot as the highest placed shooter in the world rankings, all three medallists from Rio 2016 were present at Tokyo.
The qualification round was still contested over six rounds with 10 shots per round, but the final saw a slight change since the last Olympics and was contested over a total of 24 shots for the two leading qualifiers. The final round started with 10 shots and, after every two shots, the shooter with the lowest score was eliminated. The winner of the qualification, Saurabh Chaudhary, was eliminated after 14 shots and placed seventh. The bronze medal went to Pang Wei and silver to Damir Mikec who both qualified for the final round only by shooting more inner 10s than Gulfam Joseph. All three had a score of 578, which left Joseph eliminated in ninth place. With this silver medal Mikec became the first male shooter to win a medal for Serbia. The gold medal went to Javad Foroughi, who had been in the lead since the second shot in the final and had a solid margin at the end. He won the first ever shooting medal for Iran at the Olympics, which made shooting only the fifth sport in which Iran had medalled after wrestling, weightlifting, taekwondo, and athletics. This was also the fifth time in a row that Asian shooters had won this event.
Finishing the qualification next to last in 35th position was Philip Elhage, who became the first ever Olympic shooting competitor to represent Aruba, although Elhage had already represented Netherlands Antilles in 2008.

In the final, Drysdale, Synek, and Tufte had all broken away from the pack by the final stretch and battled each other to capture gold. The Norwegian emerged as the victor, with Synek coming in 0.8 seconds later for silver, leaving bronze for the pre-race favorite from New Zealand.

Shooters shot 40 shots from 300 metres in a kneeling position for a possible of 400 points. This event was a part of the 3-position free rifle event which was shot concurrently for individuals and teams, and like the other two elements, prone and standing, it counted as a separate event with medals being awarded accordingly. It was the only time at the Olympics that this happened.
For the first and only time, the World Championships were held concurrently with the Olympics and the Olympic Champions also became World Champions. It was the fourth staging of the World Championships, having previously been held in Lyon (France) in 1897, Turin (Italy) 1898 and Loosduinen 1899 which, since 1923 has been a district of Den Haag (Netherlands).
Konrad Stäheli of Switzerland had won the last two World Championships and was favourite to defend his title in Paris. The 1899 silver and bronze medallists, Emil Kellenberger (Switzerland) and Henrik Sillem (Netherlands), who was also the 1897 bronze medallist, were also competing, as were the 1898 French silver and bronze medallists Achille Paroche and Léon Moreaux. All the World Championship medallists since 1897 appeared in Paris with the exception of the 1897 gold and silver medallists Frank Jullien and Alcide Hirschy, both from Switzerland.
Konrad Stäheli, was in a class of his own and won the first Olympic title and with it, his third World championship title in this event. He would go on to add another seven world titles to his collection, in 1901-02 and 1910-1914, for a total of ten titles. He won four medals, including three golds in 1900, but despite his long career, appeared in just one more Olympics, at the 1906 Intercalated Games when he added a gold and silver medal to his tally.

This meant that the 9th and 10th placed qualifiers were promoted and fortunately for France, one of them was Said’s team-mate Danny Rodrigues. The other replacement was Ukraine’s Ihor Radivilov. Neither of the two replacements were fancied to win a medal because there were a host of great champions making up his final.
The defending Olympic Champion Arthur Zanetti of Brazil was out to win the title again on home soil, and since the London Games he had won gold on the rings at the 2013 World Championship and 2015 Pan American Games. The reigning World Champion and 2015 and 2016 European Champion, Eleftherios Petrounias of Greece was also amongst the front-runners, as was the highest scoring qualifier Liu Yang of China. He was the 2014 Rings World Champion and the bronze medallist in 2015 - his team-mate You Hao was the silver medallist at the 2015 Worlds in Glasgow.
You Hao opened proceedings and chose a routine with the event’s highest difficulty of 7.000, but fell 0.400 points short of his qualifying mark with 15.400. A stunning performance by the World Champion Petrounias followed and it left the other athletes wondering what they had to do to beat his score of 16.000. Denis Ablyazin, a bronze and silver medallist in London 2012 on the floor and vault respectively, and the 2016 European rings silver medallist, moved into second place with 15.700 and then the second Chinese gymnast Liu Yang could only get himself into third place with 15,600. The leader board changed, however, after the last man, Arthur Zanetti, gave a great performance for which he received 15.766. He moved into second place behind the new champion Petrounias, the man who had the honour of being the first torch bearer after the Olympic torch had been lit at Olympia in April 2016.

While the Norwegians dominated with a clean sweep in the first cross-country event, the 30 km skiathlon, the gold medalist Simen Hegstad Krüger, had to settle for second place in the 15 km. The other two Norwegian medalists in the skiathlon, Martin Johnsrud Sundby and Hans Christer Holund went home empty handed after placing fourth and sixth, respectively, in the 15 km.
At these Games, the 15 km event was the only men’s cross-country event in which skiers started at 30 second intervals, and was, this time, run in the freestyle technique. After a cautious start, Cologna took the lead at the 6.0 km mark and remained in the lead until the end of the race. He gradually extended his margin to 18.3 sec at the finish line. A fierce struggle for the silver and bronze medals took place behind him. In the first phase of the race, French veteran Maurice Manificat set the fastest pace, holding on to second place until the 9.8 km mark, but eventually dropped to fifth place. Also, Holund and Sundby were in the top three at different stages of the race. But the actual medal winners Krüger and Russian newcomer, and dark horse, Denis Spitsov, came from behind. Krüger was amongst the leading three for the first time at the 9.8 km mark while Spitsov was still in fifth place at the last split time at 13.5 km. After competing just one World Cup season, the Russian’s bronze medal was quite a remarkable achievement, although he had won an Under-23 World title earlier in the year.
The first finisher on the leader board was Switzerland’s Roman Furger, setting the mark as an early starter with number 20, before eventually ending up on 12th place. Due to the sequence of the numbers, Spitsov later clocked the fastest time, but within minutes, was out-performed by Krüger and Cologna. The latter was one of the favorites at the start and had the advantage of being in control of the race and also being aware of the split times of his opponents.
Norway’s top man for the short distances, and already decorated with the gold in the sprint, Johannes Høsflot Klæbo was not in this race. He was given a break in view of the prestigious relay scheduled for two days after the 15 km. Depression spread among the Swedish cross-country skiers after suffering another bitter defeat. They didn’t come anywhere near the medals, with their best runner, Marcus Hellner doing no better than eighth. There was disappointment also for the 2017 50 km world champion, Canada’s Alex Harvey who, after another good race, could only finish seventh, 35 seconds behind Cologna. After five World Championships medals, he went home from his third Olympic Games without a medal.

There were two semi-finals, with nine teams in each, the top three teams in each qualifying for the final, joined by the four teams with the next fastest four times. Finland made it to the final, but barely, placing sixth in heat one, and would never figure in the medal race in the final. In the final, Sweden took the early lead, led by Charlotte Kalla. After four legs, Sweden and Germany were virtually tied, with Russia another 1.2 seconds back, as the medals were decided. Kalla tried to make a break on the penultimate leg of the event, but by the final exchange the Russian team had caught up with her, followed closely by the Germans. German Claudia Nystad then tried to take a commanding lead in the final leg, but Anna Haag (SWE) closed the gap with the Russians falling back. With neither Nystad nor Haag able to make a decisive move, it was down to a sprint to the finishing line to determine the gold and silver medals. Coming into the home straight Nystad was the one who pulled away to win by 0.6 seconds from Haag. Russia skied comfortably to the bronze medal, with Italy almost seven seconds back in fourth.

After a quiet first series of bouts controversy reared its’ head in the second round of fights when the result of the match-up between American Errol Spence and Vikas Krishan Yadav of India was overturned when it was decided the referee had failed to issue two warnings to the Indian fighter in the final round.
The quarter-finals also saw an outbreak of bickering over two bouts which were both decided on countback after a tie. Fred Evans, the European champion from Great Britain, scored a contentious victory over Canada’s Custio Clayton whilst Frenchman Alexis Vastine exited the ring in floods of tears when he lost an unpopular decision to Shelestiuk. Inspired by the home crowd Evans then picked up an upset victory over Shelestiuk to book a meeting with Sapiyez in the gold medal decider. Up to the final Sapiyev had been amongst the most impressive performers in the whole boxing tournament and, despite the noise emanating from the home support, he was a class above his British opponent in each of the three rounds and kept up his nations’ record of winning at least one boxing title at each Olympic Games they have attended. For his performances Sapiyev was awarded the Val Barker Trophy for the outstanding boxer of the Games.

In the final Farkas met Poland’s Piotr Stępień, whose only previous international medal was a silver in the 1989 Europeans. As expected it was an easy gold medal victory for Farkas, 6-1. The bronze was won by Unified Team wrestler Daulet Turlykhanov, who had won a silver medal in 1988 as a welterweight.

In 2004 he and his brother Karoly, were arrested after police discovered more than 3,000 marijuana plants growing in their mother’s basement in Budapest. Péter and Karoly escaped from police custody in November 2008 shortly before being sentenced to five years in prison. Karoly pretended to be ill and the two left the court room during the break between the announcement of the verdict and sentencing, and did not return. Karoly was captured almost immediately, but Péter was not rearrested until a year later in Andorra. Their sentences were subsequently extended to seven years.” Zander turned out a bit better and won a silver medal in this class at Atlanta in 1996.

Another youngster, 20-year old Andreas Bauer of  West Germany, was in third place after a jump of 87.0 m, but well behind the two favorites.

Despite dominating the sport since the late 1980s, this continued the Korean gold medal shut-out in the Olympic men’s individual event.

The early years of women’s international biathlon had been dominated by Norwegian and Swedish athletes. But in recent years the Soviet women, or at Albertville, the Unified Team women, had come on strong. The favorite was Norway’s Grete Ingeborg Nykkelmo, the 1991 World Champion and a former cross-country skier. In the end the first women’s Olympic gold medal would go to a former cross-country Olympian, Anfisa Reztsova, who had won two medals in cross-country skiing at Calgary in 1988. She won the sprint despite three missed targets shooting, but her skiing was so powerful that she overcame that. The other two medalists also missed two targets, as skiing predominated in this event. Reztsova would go on to win the 1991-92 World Cup and would repeat in the 1992-93 season. Nykkelmo placed 31st, done in by five shooting misses.

As always, the endurance is critical in the three-day to determine the overall winners, and Great Britain led this phase, with the United States second and Australia third. That put Great Britain ahead going into the jumping, trailed by the USA, the Soviet Union, and Australia. Great Britain finished second in jumping, behind France, to comfortably win the gold medal, with silver going to the United States and bronze to Australia. The Soviets had lost one rider in the endurance phase and when only two of their riders finished the jumping they were eliminated. Eight of the 12 teams finished the event. Jane Bullen on the British team was the first event female eventing gold medalist.

Kim was the defending World Champion, and had only lost twice since 2007, placing third at the 2008 Worlds and second in the 2009 Grand Prix Final. In 2008-09, she won the World Championships, Skate America, and the Four Continents, while in the 2009-10 season she had already won Skate America and the Grand Prix Final coming into Vancouver. In the short program, she opened well, taking a comfortable lead over Japan’s Mao Asada. Two nights later, in the free skate, her performance was the stuff of legend, as she scored 150.06 for a total of 228.56, both world best marks for women in the new scoring system – the previous bests were 133.95 and 210.03 by Kim at the 2009 French Grand Prix. This gave her a huge victory over Asada, who held on for the silver medal, leading her by 23.06 points. Kim was coached by Brian Orser, the 1988 men’s silver medalist.
The bronze medal was won by Canadian Joannie Rochette, but on this day, it shone as brilliantly in the Vancouver sun as any gold medal. Rochette had been runner-up to Kim at the 2009 World Championships and was a six-time Canadian champion, having twice won the Trophée Éric Bombard. A native of a small-town in Québec, on Saturday, only days before the short program, her mother and father flew to Vancouver to watch their daughter compete in the Olympics. On arrival at the airport, Thérèse Rochette developed chest pains and was rushed to a Vancouver hospital where she died soon thereafter from the effects of a massive heart attack. Joannie was scheduled to compete in the short program on Tuesday but it was not certain if she would compete. She elected to skate, honoring her mother, and she placed third in the short with a solid program with no significant flaws. On the night of the free skate, her father, Normand Rochette, watched from the stands as his daughter skated beautifully. She had one small stumble coming out of a combination jump, but she held up both physically and emotionally, to mount the podium in her mother’s memory, the first time a Canadian had won an Olympic medal in the ladies’ singles since Elizabeth Manley in Calgary in 1988. All Canada cheered for her.

The task of defending the nation’s crown fell on Vladimír Andrs and Pavel Hofmann, the 1963 European Champions, but other duos seemed stronger. The Soviet Union, for example, sent Oleg Tyurin and Boris Dubrovsky, who were the reigning European Champions and runners-up at the inaugural World Championships, the latter of which had been won by France’s René Duhamel and Bernard Monnereau. The United States, reigning Pan American champions, sent their single sculling champion from that event, Sy Cromwell, and Jim Storm.
The Americans dominated the field in the opening round, while Czechoslovakia and the Soviet Union won their respective heats, although the latter would have placed fourth and fifth in the Czech and American heats respectively. Switzerland, Germany, and France passed through the repêchage to join these three in the finals, which were won convincingly by an invigorated Soviet effort. The United States and Czechoslovakia had a closer race, but the former had pulled ahead by the end and captured the silver medal, leaving the Czechoslovakians with bronze.

The qualifying teams were selected as follows: host nation (United States), World Cup (Italy, Netherlands, Brazil), Continental Qualifiers (Tunisia, Korea, Russia, Cuba, Argentina), and qualification tournaments (Serbia & Montenegro [Yugoslavia], Bulgaria, Poland).
The two dominant teams in the past four years had been Italy and the Netherlands. Italy had won the 1990 and 1994 World Championships and the 1993 and 1995 European Championships. But they had always been closely pushed by the Dutch team, silver medalists at the 1994 Worlds and both Europeans. The Netherlands had upset Italy in the quarter-finals at the 1992 Olympics and only a few weeks before the 1996 Olympics, defeated them in five sets in the final of the World League tournament in Rotterdam. In pool play, the two teams were drawn together in Group B, and Italy won their match easily in three sets. As expected, they both made it thru to the final, which was a titanic struggle. It went five sets, with the teams alternating set victories. The final set was very close, and Italy got to 15-14 and match point, but the Netherlands scored three straight points to win the gold medal, 17-15. All three medalists came out of Group B, as Serbia & Montenegro (Yugoslavia) defeated Russia in five sets to win the bronze medal, their ever volleyball medal. They missed their team captain, Dejan Brđović, for several matches, including the bronze medal match, as he left the team after his son died from a brain tumor.
In 1985, the Dutch started a program unique in the Netherlands, in which the entire national team would train together, not playing in the standard Dutch competitions. Named after their base (the Bankras hall), the goal of the “Bankrasmodel” was to win Olympic gold in 1992. After some initial success (a surprising fifth-place in 1988), the team fell apart, with various players signing lucrative contracts abroad, and coach Arie Selinger leaving the team. They all rejoined for the Barcelona Games and, after a poor start, upset Italy and Cuba to win a silver medal. With a new coach (Joop Alberda), they became a consistent force, but always finished behind Italy, until the 1996 Olympics. In 1999, Dutch TV viewers elected the gold medal in Atlanta as the “sporting moment of the 20th century.”

The Soviets controversially held out 400 gold medalist Viktor Markin in the opening round, instead running Viktor Burakov. But Buryakov developed a mysterious injury before the final, allowing Markin to run. The final was quite close throughout with no more than 1-2 metres separating the USSR and the GDR. The GDR actually had a narrow lead at the bell, and their anchor was run by Volker Beck, gold medalist in the 400 hurdles. But Markin ran him down on the final lap, and won by slightly over a metre.

Kripps came to PyeongChang as the reigning World Cup holder and World Championship silver medalist. His compatriot, Spring, was third in the World Cup, and splitting the two Canadians was the 2016-17 World Cup winner, Germany’s Francesco Friedrich. The German enjoyed two wins and three seconds in the final five races of the 2017-18 season, and had it not have been for three poor opening results, he could well have been World Cup champion again, adding to his four World Championship gold medals from 2013 and 2015-17.
The defending Olympic champions, Beat Hefti and Alex Baumann of Switzerland (subsequently promoted to first place after the disqualification of the Russian pair Aleksandr Zubkov and Aleksey Voyevoda), did not defend their title. Also, the double Sochi silver medalist Steve Holcomb was not in Korea to add to his medal tally, as he sadly died at the US training camp at Lake Placid in May 2017.
The German, Canadian and Latvian crews all showed they would be forces to be reckoned with during the official training heats, and the British duo of Brad Hall and Joel Fearon, the only Winter Olympian to run 100 metres under 10 seconds, were considered as fancied outsiders. Once the serious competition got under way, however, it was Latvia’s Oskars Melbardis, the third fastest man in official training, who set the pace on the first run, edging out Kripps and Nico Walther of Germany, who had also put in some impressive runs in training. Melbardis, along with brakeman Jānis Strenga, set a new track record of 49.08 sec.
Melbardis slipped to fourth after a 10th place finish in the second heat and was 0.27s behind the heat-winner Walther, who became the new outright leader, up from third. Kripps moved into second, with Germany’s Johannes Lochner in third. The Canadian pair of Spring and Lascelles Brown opened the first two heats with eighth and 13th place finishes to effectively end Brown’s hopes of becoming the first Canadian to win three bobsleigh medals, in what were his fifth Olympics at the age of 43.
While the -11.1C ice temperature in heat two saw slightly slower times, things were back to normal in heat three as Francesco Friedrich put in a brilliant finish at the end of his third run to beat Melbardis’ day-old track record with a 48.96. This run moved him into second place, with Kripps the new leader and Lochner down from first to third, and Melbardis holding on to fourth. Just 13/100ths of a second separated the top five, leaving the battle for the medal positions wide open.
The field was reduced from 30 to 20 pairs for the fourth and final run, with both Germany and Canada each having three teams competing. With five sleds to go, the medal positions were still in the balance, but Melbardis put himself in with a great chance after what would be the fastest run of the heat, 49.21. When Johannes Lochner could not overhaul him, after the slowest of his four runs, the Latvians were guaranteed a medal, but its colour was still uncertain.
The penultimate pair to go were Germany’s Francesco Friedrich and Thorsten Margis, and their combined time of 3:16.86 put them in the gold medal position with only Justin Kripps and Alexander Kopacz to go, trying win Canada’s first 2-man gold medal since 1998. Kripps needed a final run of 49.27 to take gold but failed by 1/100th of a second, which resulted in a tie for the gold medal. The only other time the gold medal was shared in Olympic bobsleigh history was in 1998, when another Canadian pair, Pierre Lueders and Dave MacEachern, shared the title with the Italians Günther Huber and Antonio Tartaglia. Coincidentally, it was Leuders who taught Kripps to become a bobsligh driver.
The shared gold medal brought an end to a memorable 12 months for Friedrich and Kripps. The German beat the Canadian into second place at the 2017 World Championships and in the 2017-18 World Cup, the roles were reversed. Now they were all-square.

In 1908, a 1,600 metre medley relay (200, 200, 400, 800) had been contested at the London Olympics.  The world record for the 4 x 400 relay was 3:18.2 which had been set on 4 September 1911 by the Irish-American Athletic Club of New York.
With four of the five 400 metre finalists, the United States was heavily favored.  There were three heats, and the U.S., Great Britain, and France advanced to the final, with Britain posting the fastest qualifying time - 3:19.0.
The final was no contest as the favored Americans shattered the world record, running 3:16.6.  Britain was hampered when their lead-off runner, George Nicol, pulled up and limped most of his lap, allowing France to garner the silver medal.
Britain’s third runner was James Soutter.  Shortly after the Olympics, in 1913, he forsook track athletics in favor of the gospel ministry and was ordained the minister of the Scots Kirk in Nairobi, the first Scottish minister in Kenya.  He returned to Scotland in 1917 and became minister of the parish of Whitekirk and Tynninghame, East Lothian where he served until he retired in 1949.

Also back in Atlanta was the 1992 silver medalist from Namibia, Frank Fredericks. As always, the Americans were very deep in the sprints, but they had no single outstanding sprinter in 1996, and in fact, at the 1995 World Championships, no American won a medal. The final began with three false starts, two of them by Linford Christie, who was then disqualified. The start was slow because of the concern over false starts, and Donovan Bailey had the slowest reaction time of the finalists (0.174).

The nation was represented by Serhiy Petrenko and Aleksandr Vinogradov at the 1976 Summer Olympics and, especially after their victory in the C-2 500 the day prior to this event’s final, were considered gold medal contenders in this event. Romania had a history of success in this event as well, most recently with Gheorghe Danielov and Gheorghe Simionov, who were normally specialists in the C-2 500, but had been runners-up at the most recent World Championships. The reigning World Champion was Hungary, who sent Tamás Buday and Oszkár Frey, who took bronze in the C-2 500 the day before this final.
The Soviet Union set an Olympic record in the opening heats, defeating Romania and helping to relegate the Hungarian crew to the repêchage, where they not only advanced to the next round, but bettered the Soviets’ Olympic record. Poland’s Jerzy Opara and Andrzej Gronowicz, runners-up in both the C-2 1000 at the 1974 World Championships and the C-2 500 at the Montreal Olympics, won the other heat. Romania posted the fastest time in the semi-finals, besting Hungary in the process, while the Soviet Union and Poland took the other two heats. The final was fairly well spread out, with the Soviet Union, Romania, Hungary, and Poland finishing in that order with room to breathe.

In the 2013-2014 season, Kramer had won all 5,000 m races he contested, including two World Cup races. Kramer’s biggest competitor seemed to be teammate Jorrit Bergsma, silver medalist at the 2013 World Championships and winner of the third 5,000 m World Cup race in the running season. The 2011 World Champion Bob de Jong had missed the Dutch team, but his “replacement” Jan Blokhuijsen had placed second in the most recent World Cup. Outside of the Dutch team, 2010 medallists Lee Seung-Hun and Ivan Skobrev were still highly considered, while the Belgian inline convert Bart Swings was considered to have a shot at a medal as well.
The first top favorite to hit the ice, Sven Kramer battered the leading time of Denis Yuskov. In a stable race, he beat his own track record and the Olympic Record by four seconds: 6:10.76. This time seemed unapproachable, but Bergsma made a brave attempt. Staying within reach of Kramer’s time until 3,800 m, he lost pace in the remaining laps, landing at 6:16.66. Blokhuijsen and Swings, in pair 12, started a little more carefully. At 3,400 m, Swings had to let Blokhuijsen go, who overtook Bergsma’s time at the bell. His 6:15.71 earned him a silver medal, while Swings ended just outside of the medals. The Dutch medal sweep was the first ever in the 5,000 m, and only the second in Olympic history for the Netherlands (the first was in the men’s 10,000 m in 1998).

He won the Asian Games title in 1986 and was runner-up at the 1987 World Cup so he would have been a top contender wherever the Games were held.
In front of a partisan home crowd Kim rose to the occasion and defeated opponents from Mongolia, Zimbabwe, the USA and Bulgaria on the way to a re-match with Andreas Tews, the man who had narrowly beaten him in the final of World Cup, to decide the Olympic championships. The fight was a classic combination of styles with the stylish East German boxing from a distance and scoring heavily with his jabs and the crouching Korean attempting to force through his opponent’s defense and land flurries of punches at close range. Although the computer recorded that Tews landed 87 scoring punches against Kim’s 67 the Korean was favoured by four of the five judges (the sole exception being the American judge) and was duly awarded the gold medal.
Kim turned professional in 1990 and embarked on a career consisting of just eight fights although two of them were unsuccessful world title challenges.

He easily won the gold medal, leading Singapore’s Tiger Tan by 17.5 kg. Tan, born Tan Howe-Liang, was the first Olympic medalist from Singapore. The bronze was won by Abdul Wahid Aziz, which through 2016, remains the only Olympic medal by an Iraqi athlete.
The fourth- and fifth-place finishers, both Poles, had the most impressive Olympic records of any of the competitors in this class. Marian Zieliński was fourth, after winning a bronze medal in 1956 as a featherweight. He would compete at the Olympics in 1964 and 1968, winning bronze medals in this class both times. At those Games, he trailed his countryman, the fifth-place finisher in Rome, Waldemar Baszanowski, who won lightweight gold at both Tokyo and Mexico City.

After a tentative performance in his first bout he was completely untroubled in 
the path to the final and had even the luxury of a walkover in the semi-final.
The combatants in the semi-final that did take place would have been considered unlikely opponents for Savón at the time he won his first Olympic gold in 1992. David Defiagbon had competed in Barcelona for Nigeria as a light-middleweight but by 1996 he had changed nationality to Canadian and had added 20 kgs in weight to fight in the heavyweight division. In contrast American Nate Jones languished in prison for grand theft and larceny for most of 1992. Defiagbon sent Jones stumbling around the ring in round one then picked him off at will for a clear points victory.
Sadly for the crowd at the Alexander Memorial Coliseum Defiagbon’s tactics against Savón were extremely negative and he seemed only to be interested in reaching the final bell rather than winning the fight. This resulted in Savón winning on a landslide 20-2 score line and forcing the Canadian to take 2 standing counts.
Savón returned to win gold in 2000 and become one of only 3 fighters to claim gold medals in 3 successive Olympics. He also won a record 6 world championship gold medals during his career.

Over the past years, three different skaters had won the world title: Erben Wennemars, Shani Davis and Rune Stordal (who didn’t qualify for Torino). Two other skaters had won the season World Cups in the same years: Mark Tuitert (not qualified either) and Yevgeny Lalenkov. Adding to the list, 5,000 m champion Chad Hedrick had bettered the world record earlier in the season.
Ahead of these favorites, in the 17th pair, two outsiders started who had both won World Cup races in the first part of the season. Simon Kuipers had been ill since, and only qualified for the Games in a skate-off, while Enrico Fabris had won the team pursuit days before the competition. Kuipers comfortably led the Italian for most of the race, but Fabris showed an unusually small decline in his lap times (26.6-27.1-27.7) to catch the Dutchman in the last lap, clocking 1:45.97 to beat his own pre-Olympic track record. None of the remaining skaters could match Fabris’s steady race, although some came close. Shani Davis had a 1.3-second lead over the Italian, yet finished at 1:46.13. His compatriot Hedrick was not far behind, with 1:46.22. Fabris’s gold medal made him the most successful male skater at the Olympics, with two golds and a bronze.

The Germans, Willi Eichhorn and Hugo Strauß, were also strong and, with the home advantage, were serious contenders. The two nations met in the opening heats and the German duo clearly dominated, finishing nearly 20 seconds ahead of the Britons, who were third behind Argentinians Julio Curatella and Horacio Podestá. The other two heats were won by Ryszard Borzuchowski and Edward Kobyliński  of Poland and Károly Győry and Tibor Mamusich of Hungary (the 1935 European champions).
With Great Britain losing to Argentina in their semi-final heat (the semi-finals essentially serving as a repêchage, as round one’s winners did not compete), the stage seemed set for an easy German victory. At the beginning, however, it was Denmark’s duo of Harry Julius Larsen and Richard Olsen, as well as Argentina, that led the way; due to faulty steering, it was not until much later in the race that Germany took the lead. Even then, Eichhorn and Strauß struggled to stay ahead of the Danes, but eventually captured the gold medal by a comfortable 3.1 second margin. Denmark settled for silver, while Argentina lodged a protest for obstruction. Although this was not recognized, the nation nonetheless captured its first Olympic rowing medal with its third-place finish.

They were the favorites to win once more, particularly in a home Olympics, but they had not won a World Championship in the event since 2005. That honor was usually carried by the Germans and the French and all members of both teams, except for France’s Michaël D’Almeida, had at least one World Championship victory to their credit. The defending World Champion, however, was Australia, and all three members of the team Matthew Glaetzer, Shane Perkins, and Scott Sunderland, were in London in hopes of capturing the Olympic title.
The qualification round was blazing, with Russia, France, and Great Britain setting consecutive Olympic records, although the British got off to a poor start when Hindes experienced an equipment malfunction and fell while coming out of the start, thus necessitating a restart. The pace did not slow in the semi-finals, where France set an Olympic record one heat prior to Britain capturing a world record. This left these two nations to race for gold while Germany and Australia dueled for bronze. In the final France nearly kept pace with the Britions through the first lap, but the stronger members of the team quickly widened the gap and made themselves untouchable, winning gold with a world record of exactly 42.6 seconds. Hoy’s gold medal tied him with British rower Steven Redgrave for the most Olympic victories; he had previously won the 1km time trial in 2004 and the sprint, team sprint, and Keirin events in 2008. His team sprint silver from 2000 also meant that he had tied the record for the most Olympic medals in track cycling. In the bronze medal match, Germany defeated the reigning World Champions, leaving the top four spots in the event looking exactly as they had four years ago.
The British victory, however, was not without controversy. Following the win, Hindes admitted that his crash in the first round was deliberate, part of the team strategy for bad starts. He had also been in danger of being passed by Kenny, which would have resulted in disqualification. Hindes later retracted his statement while British Cycling noted that, as a non-native English speaker, Hindes has simply misspoken. Both the International Olympic Committee and the International Cycling Union declined to investigate and the French did not initiate a complaint, believing the tactic to be within the rules, if not in good sportsmanship.

Meanwhile at London 2012 at Hadleigh Farms, the course was enjoyed by the riders and was very spectator friendly (rated at 60% visibility). The South African course designer for the Rio 2016 Olympic Games mountain bike course, Nick Floros, created a technically challenging course for the riders, yet one that allowed the spectators to enjoy the competition as much as possible, with an 85% visibility, all while making use of the natural landscape at the Deodoro venue.
The Mountain Bike Centre in Rio was one of three venues that comprised the X-Park (along with canoe slalom and BMX), and was built with legacy in mind, remaining open to the public following the Olympics. The mountain bike course consisted of grassy wide-open stretches combined with man-made obstacles and serious slopes - a marked difference from the more level terrain four years before in London 2012.
The mountain bike races were mass start events on 20 (women) and 21 (men) August 2016. Riders were seeded into a starting grid according to their current Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI) ranking. The riders completed one 0.57 km start loop, followed by six laps of the course for women (29.67 km) and seven laps for the men (34.52 km), where each lap was 4.85 km long. The total number of laps to be raced was announced at the team managers’ meeting on the day before the first race with the aim to ensure that the winning time was within the set parameters.
With the same rules and competition format, the only differences between the World Championships and the Olympic Games is that there are more competitors in the field at World Championships, due to different quotas for each National Olympic Committee (NOC): at the Olympic Games there are a maximum of three men and two women per NOC. There were no rule and competition format changes since the 2012 Olympic Games in London.
The women’s mountain bike race at the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio started at 12:30 pm on 20 August 2016, and consisted of 29 riders from 23 nations. It was 33 degrees Celsius. As aforementioned, the race configuration consisted of one start loop of 0.57 km, plus six laps of the course for a total of 29.67 km. Linda Indergand of Switzerland set the early pace in the six-lap race, coming through first to start the second lap, followed nine seconds later by Poland’s Maja Włoszczowska, Jolanda Neff of Switzerland and Jenny Rissveds of Sweden. Four seconds back from the lead pack was Norway’s Gunn Rita Dahle-Flesjå, followed by World bronze medallist Canadian Emily Batty and Czech Kateřina Nash, the winter/summer Olympian, who were just over 23 seconds back.
On the second lap, Indergand relinquished her lead to the chasers, with Rissveds, Neff and Włoszczowska forming a new lead threesome that took charge going into the second half of the race. Soon Rissveds led the lead group to start lap four, holding a three second advantage over Neff, and four seconds over Włoszczowska. Neff eventually paid for her efforts to keep up with Rissveds, losing contact with the Swedish rider and Włoszczowska.
Going into the penultimate lap, Włoszczowska led Rissveds through the start/finish, with Neff falling further off the lead pace, and a trio made of up Canadians Catharine Pendrel and Emily Batty, along with Nash chasing, nearly a minute later. But Neff continued to fade over the fifth lap, with both Pendrel and Batty passing her, while Nash fell off the pace of the Canadian pair, who were going to be battling each other for the final spot on the medal podium.
Starting the sixth and final lap, Włoszczowska led Rissveds through the line, with Pendrel chasing solo 30 seconds back, and Batty another eight seconds behind. Rissveds, however, rode away from Włoszczowska over the rocky technical sections in the beginning of the lap, and from there the 22-year-old Swedish rider smoothly drove over the finish line, and to the gold medal. Rissveds took the silver. The Canadians, Pendrel and Batty, battled down the home stretch, with Pendrel, who had overcome an early crash that dropped her to 15th place, finishing with the bronze medal, avenging her Olympic heartbreak from 2012, two seconds ahead of Canadian team mate Batty in fourth. The medals were presented by Tricia Smith, IOC member (Canada) and Emin Muftuoglu, Member of the UCI Management Committee.

Most observers, however, would have expected a country from the Communist bloc to take the title and they had at least two nations to choose from. Bulgaria sent its reigning World Champions, Vasil Radev and Daniel Yordanov, to the 1988 Games, while East Germany was always a threat with Uwe Mund and Uwe Heppner, the latter of whom had won a medal at the last four World Championships, including gold in 1983 and 1985. The Soviet Union had won only one World Championship medal in this event since 1975, silver in 1985, and sent Oleksandr Marchenko and Vasily Yakusha. The reigning Commonwealth champions were Pat Walter and Bruce Ford, the latter of whom had won a bronze medal in the quadruple sculls at the 1984 Games.
The heats in the opening round were won by the Soviet Union, the Dutch duo of Ronald Florijn and Nico Rienks, and the Danish pair of Bjarne Eltang and Per Rasmussen, who defeated both East Germany and Bulgaria. The United States, meanwhile, was eliminated in the repêchage. The East Germans regrouped in the semi-finals, winning their heat in the fastest time of the round, but they faltered in the final and finished a distant fifth.  The Netherlands, meanwhile, pulled off an upset by capturing gold, as did the Swiss crew of Beat Schwerzmann and Ueli Bodenmann, who took silver by a margin of 0.28 seconds ahead of the bronze medal-winning Soviets. The Netherlands thus earned its first Olympic rowing title since Jan Wienese had won the single sculls in 1968.

On 7 March 2009, Davis became the first man to beat 1:07 in the event, lowering the world record considerably to 1:06.42. And Davis had been quite untouchable during the running season as well, winning each of the four World Cup races contested prior to the Games. Davis’s status of a favourite was even further increased by the fact that the other skaters behind him had not performed consistently, and the podium was essentially open to about 10 skaters.
Shani Davis also enjoyed the advantage of having drawn the last pair, and could watch his opponents prior to taking the ice himself. When he did, the fastest time had been set by Mo Tae-Beom, the surprising winner of the 500 m. The Korean had posted the fastest splits of the race in his duel with Chad Hedrick. As usual, the 2006 5,000 m champion, posted a strong final lap, but Mo held on to win in 1:09.12, two tenths ahead of Hedrick. While not known for his quick openers, Davis trailed Mo’s early splits by less than three tenths, then pulled away in the final 400 m to win in 1:08.94.

But the event would again be a titanic fight between the two teams. Right from the start they established themselves, with Norway leading on the first leg by just over eight seconds ahead of Italy. Italy’s Giorgio Di Centa fell back on the second leg, dropping his team to fourth, with Norway still leading, by 11 seconds over Germany. But Pietro Piller Cottrer brought Italy back, skiing the fastest leg of the event so far, and making up significant time on Kristen Skjeldal, as Norway entered the anchor leg only a ½-second ahead of Italy.

Shortly after her victory in Rio, Bouwmeester claimed her third world title.

The course began and ended in the Colombes Stadium and run over an out-and-back course into the French country to the northwest of Paris. The defending champion, Hannes Kolehmainen, competed in 1924, although he had not run any of the Finnish trial races. The Finnish Olympic trial was won by Willie Kyrönen with Albin Stenroos second. Also highly considered was the British runner, Duncan Wright. The top American runner was probably Clarence DeMar who had run in the 1912 Olympic marathon, and would eventually win seven Boston marathons.
The race started at 5:23 PM, delayed for two hours because the officials were concerned about the heat that had so affected the cross-country race the previous day. The early lead was taken by Greece’s Alexandros Kranis, but France’s Georges Verger took over the lead at about 20 km. But just before the turnaround, Stenroos took the lead from Verger and powered ahead to an easy victory, winning by almost six minutes. By 27 km. a small pack of DeMar, Finland’s Lauri Halonen, and Italy’s Romeo Bertini had settled into the race for the other medals. Bertini won the silver medal, a minute of DeMar who took the bronze.

The world record was 1:06.2 set by Soviet Nikolay Pankin, who made the final, but he had set that back in 1969, an eternity ago in swimming circles. That record did not do well in the semi-finals in Munich as John Hencken (USA) swam 1:05.68 in the first semi, only to see Japan’s Nobutaka Taguchi better that in the second heat with 1:05.13. In the final the American threesome of Hencken, Tom Bruce, and Mark Chatfield led to the turn with Taguchi back in seventh place. At 85 metres Bruce seemed to have the race in hand, but Taguchi closed quickly to take the gold medal and another world record, 1:04.94. Bruce held on for second with Hencken winning bronze. David Wilkie of Great Britain finished last in the final. In 1973 at the World Championships, Hencken would win gold with Wilkie second, and Taguchi third. Over the next few years Hencken and Wilkie would become the world’s top breaststrokers and battle for superiority among themselves. At Montréal in 1976 Hencken would win gold in this event, with Wilkie the 200 breaststroke gold.

It is a two-person team endurance relay, with one of the riders off the track at any one time. The race was over 200 laps for a distance of 50 km with 20 sprints (every tenth lap) and the first over the line at each sprint received 5 points, with the next three receiving 3, 2 and 1 point respectively. On the 20th and last lap, those points were doubled. If a team lapped the entire field they received 20 extra points and if they were themselves lapped, had 20 points deducted.
Denmark’s Lasse Norman Hansen, the team pursuit silver medallist, and his partner Michael Mørkøv were favourites for the gold medal as they were the reigning world champions. The bronze medallists from the 2020 World Championships, Germany’s Roger Kluge and Theo Reinhardt, were also in the field. The Germans were also the 2019 world champions. The Tokyo 2020 Omnium winner Matthew Walls of Great Britain, and partner Ethan Hayter, were also considered medal prospects.
France’s Benjamin Thomas and Donavan Grondin won the first two sprints but it was the British pair of Walls and Hayter who took control and were in the lead after 10 of the 20 sprints, albeit by a single point from Denmark’s Hansen and Mørkøv. After 14 laps, France held that same slender one-point lead over the Danes as the race was setting itself up for an exciting finish.
Going into the final sprint Denmark led with 41 points, with France on 36, Great Britain on 30. Only France could overtake the Danes but it was Britain who surged over the line first for 10 points and a total of 40. France scored just four points on the last sprint and also finished on 40 but Demark held on to gold with 43 points. Britain took the silver because they crossed the finishing line ahead of France. Denmark’s Lasse Norman Hansen and Michael Mørkøv now added Olympic gold to their World Championship gold while Hansen won his second medal of the Games.

But Năstac had sustained a cut eye in his quarter, and was deemed unfit to fight, so Spinks moved on to the final against the Soviet Rufat Riskiyev, the 1974 World Champion, having had only one fight. Riskiyev had defeated Spinks at a match in Tashkent early in 1976, but in the final, Spinks landed a telling body blow in round three, and the referee had to stop the contest, giving Spinks the gold medal.
Spinks, whose brother, Leon, won the light-heavyweight gold medal in Montréal, turned professional. In 1981 he won the WBA light-heavyweight world title by defeating Eddie Mustafa Muhammad. Michael Spinks would hold a version of the light-heavyweight title through 1985 when he moved up to the heavies and defeated Larry Holmes to win the IBF heavyweight crown, the first light-heavyweight champion to move on to become heavyweight world champ. Spinks fought through 1988, winning his first 31 fights, but he retired after losing a heavyweight title fight that year to Mike Tyson.

Irie had shown glimpses of her ability in her few pre-Olympic international appearances but she was given little chance of winning gold, despite the home “crowd” support. However, Irie made the most of a series of upsets in the second round of fights which saw all four seeded fighters exit the competition in their first contests. The top seed, world champion Lin Yu-ting of Chinese Taipei fell to Nesthy Petecio of the Philippines.
The Japanese fighter won a closely contested semi-final by outlasting British opponent Karriss Artingstall to book a place in the gold medal bout against Petecio, who outpointed Italy’s Irma Testa earlier in the day.

He was also runner-up in the 1996-97 distance World Cup to Finland’s Mika Myllylä, who wsa 1997 World Champion over 50 km, and was trailing in the 1997-98 distance World Cup, behind his teammate, Thomas Alsgaard, who was also the defending champion. The race was held in a heavy, damp snowfall that made conditions difficult. The leader at every checkpoint, with the fastest intermediate splits at all but the closing split, was Myllylä, who won convincingly by 1:31.3 over Norway’s Erling Jevne. Dæhlie was sixth at the 1.8 km split, but got progressively slower as the race went on, eventually finishing a shocking 20th.
At the 1999 World Championships, with Dæhlie retired, Myllylä won the 10 km, 30 km, and 50 km gold medals. He would eventually win 10 World Championship medals and six Olympic medals. In 2001 he seemingly led Finland to the relay World Championship in Lahti, Finland, before his fans. But the team was later disqualified when six skiers where found to have used hydroxyethyl starch (HES), a blood plasma expander that can be used as a masking agent for erythropoietin or its derivatives. The team was disqualified and all the skiers, including Myllylä, were suspended for two years. He tried to come back briefly, but with little success and retired in 2005. Jevne was a distance specialist, who won several gold medals with the powerhouse Norwegian relay teams. Individually his best performances came when he won the 50 km at the 1996 Holmenkollen Ski Festival, and won silver at the 1997 World Championships over 50 km.

The first favoured fighter to fall was the veteran Cuban-born Azeri Lorenzo Sotomayor, a victim of a cut above the eye in his bout with Madiev of Georgia. In contrast, McCormack and Zamkovoy reached the semi-finals with a minimum of fuss. They were joined in the final four by Roniel Iglesias of Cuba, the 2012 light-welterweight gold medallist, and surprise contender Aidan Walsh of Ireland.
Sadly for Walsh, his prospects were ended at his moment of triumph. Celebrating his quarter-final victory, he jumped for joy as his win was confirmed but landed awkwardly and fractured his ankle, causing him to withdraw from the tournament.
The second semi-final saw the 33-year-old Iglesias, thought by most to be passed his best at his fourth Olympics, regain all the glories that seemed to be in the past for him. Using his foot speed and unerring accuracy, he outboxed and cut the Russian to build up an early lead which Zamkovoy could not overhaul.
Iglesias’s resurgence continued unabated in the final. Once again, he jumped out to an early lead and, while McCormack had some success in the final round, the Cuban’s gold medal victory was beyond doubt.

Rinong qualified for the semi-final in sixth place. The world champion Kim Kuk-Hyang finished 25th and was outside the top 18 to make it through to the next round; her best dive brought her just 67.50 points as she was eliminated. Last of the qualifiers was Russia’s Yuliya Timoshinina who landed face first into the pool on her second dive and received just 14 points, never recovering from that, but what an Olympic pedigree she had.

She recovered with two final dives of 81.60 to stay in contention while her team-mate Si Jayjie remained in the gold medal position helped by a brilliant third dive, an armstand back double somersault with one and a half twists, for which she received four 9s from the seven judges and a total of 84.80 as she went into the final 22.30 points ahead of Jessica Parratto with Australia’s Melissa Wu up to fourth.
Canada’s Meaghan Benfeito led after the first round dives in the final with Si and Parratto sharing second place. But after dive two, Si was in the lead with Ren moving up from fourth to second, with Parratto in third and Benfeito relegated to fourth, but then the competition all changed. Ren Qian  took the lead after her third dive, a brilliantly executed inward three-and-a-half somersault, which earned her 94.05, the highest score of the night, and, in the same round, Parratto moved out of contention with the worst dive of the night, which scored just 44.80. Ren’s two final dives were both in excess of 90 points and she achieved four 10s in those two dives. Only Si stayed with her but even she knew it was all over before her final dive as she needed over 100 to win. While the two Chinese divers were pulling away from the field, Benfeito dived consistently to win the bronze medal, albeit 30 points behind Si and 50 points behind Ren, to add to the bronze she won in the synchronised platform event. On winning at 15 years and 180 days, Ren became the youngest medalist at the Rio Games, as she was 120 days younger than Japan’s Mima Ito who won bronze in the women’s team table tennis two days earlier.

Reed and Triggs Hodge were the runners up in the coxless pairs at the last three World Championships, but were pulled from that event to row in the fours because it was believed (correctly, as it turned out) that the British would be unable to defeat the unstoppable New Zealand duo of Eric Murray and Hamish Bond in the pairs. James, meanwhile, was one of the four members of the World Championship-winning boat and was joined by teammate Alex Gregory, also a 2009 World Champion in the event, to round out the quartet.

Not even a desperate push from the Australians at the end, however, could stop the Britons, who took the gold after a well-raced match, leaving their rivals to accept silver. The United States had an impressive run as well in the event, earning bronze by finishing the course over four seconds faster than their nearest competitor.

It was Hungary and Slovakia, however, that were considered slight favorites. Hungary’s crew had Zoltán Kammerer, Olympic gold medalist in the event in 2000 and 2004 and World Champion in 1999. Slovakia had Erik Vlček, runner-up in Beijing and bronze medalist in Athens, and World Champion in 2002 and 2003. Still, the event was unpredictable and many nations who entered possessed credentials that could claim them victory in the tournament.
Slovakia and Hungary started the event looking good by winning their heats and posting two of the three fastest times, with the Czech Republic sandwiched between them. Australia and Germany finished the semi-finals in times faster than any of those nations, meaning that nearly every team in the final had at least some chance of capturing a podium spot. After a false start from Hungary, the Australian team took the lead early on and never relinquished it. Although they were never quite able to escape the pack, they were also never in any real danger of losing their victory, answering every push from the Hungarians at their heels with power of their own. Hungary narrowly captured the silver medal, finishing less than two-tenths of a second ahead of a massive push from the Czech Republic in the final stretch of the course. The Australian victory was a surprising one for, although they had been silver medalists at the last World Championship, they had not performed well at recent World Cup events and were not expected to medal, let alone win the event. The favored Slovakian team, meanwhile, never mounted a true challenge and placed sixth.

The other medal challengers appeared to come from the USA, Italy and Austria.
The first run produced a series of shocks. At the head of the field were two Austrian family pairings and it was the Linger brothers who led from the more experienced Schiegl cousins. Mark Grimmette and Brian Martin, silver medallists in Salt Lake City, crashed out on turn 14 and minutes later the Ukrainian pairing went airborne on the same curve. Oleh Zherebytskiy was flown by helicopter to a hospital in Pinerolo after sustaining a head injury.
The second part of the competition was just as unpredictable as the first. The expected charge from Leitner and Resch failed to materialise and instead they dropped down the field to seventh.  The Schiegls also had a poor run and with only the Lingers to come the Florschütz and Wustlich team held onto the top position. Andreas and Wolfgang Linger needed only to finish within a tenth of a second of the Germans to become Olympic champions but instead they took a further two tenths off their rivals. The first Austrians to win this title since 1964, the Linger brothers had won the 2003 World Championships, but had not figured prominently in a major championship since then.

Switzerland’s Nicola Spirig had already won two of the stages of the ITU World Series and was favored with Jenkins hurt, although Australia’s Emma Moffatt was expected to challenge for gold.
The run was four laps of a 2½ km course, and as the leaders entered the final lap, there was a lead pack of five athletes – Spirig, Jenkins, Lisa Nordén (SWE), Erin Densham (AUS), and Sarah Groff (USA), as Moffatt had crashed on the bike ride and would not finish. Jenkins was dropped first by the leaders as she could not keep pace. Groff held on until about 700 metres from the finish but then was dropped, leaving Spirig, Nordén and Densham to contest the medals. Spirig and Nordén ran shoulder-to-shoulder and gradually dropped Densham within the last 200 metres. The two leaders could not be separated and neither was ever able to get an entire body width in front, as the lead changed hands several times. At the end they were in an all-out sprint, still with nothing to separate them.
As they hit the line, seemingly together, it was unclear who had won. Finally, the finish photo determined that Spirig had won the gold medal, although they were given the same time and the margin was later revealed to be only 0.009 seconds, a ridiculous margin to determine a champion in a 2-hour race.

(29.8 miles).,na,"Tyler Hamilton was the second best American road racer in the early part of the 21st century, following Lance Armstrong. Thru 2001 he had been one of Armstrong’s lieutenants on the US Postal Service team but he left in 2002 to ride for Team CSC. He was renowned for his efforts in the 2003 Tour de France, in which he fractured his collarbone early in the race, but continued to ride despite the pain, winning the 16th stage in a long solo breakaway and placing fourth in GC in Paris. In 2004 he moved to Phonak but this time had to leave the Tour de France after a back injury sustained in a 13th stage fall, and then had to deal with the death of his beloved golden retriever, Tugboat (aka Tugger). On the Vouliagmeni course, Hamilton started out slowly as his earpiece radio was broken and he could not hear the splits. But he finished the race stronger than any rider and bested the time of defending gold medalist Vyacheslav Yekimov by almost 19 seconds, winning the gold medal.
And then the excrement struck the cooling apparatus. Hamilton’s doping test showed evidence of blood doping. But it was not conclusive, and no action was taken initially, so the B sample was frozen. The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) asked for a review of the tests, but with the B sample having been frozen, it was inadequate to test for blood transfusions. Because a doping positive required both the A and B samples to be positive, Hamilton was exonerated and retained his gold medal.
A few weeks later, racing in the Vuelta a España, Hamilton again tested positive for blood transfusions, and this time both the A and B samples were positive. He lost his contract with Phonak, and was banned from cycling for two years, despite appeals to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS), which were rejected. When Hamilton’s ban was about to run out in late 2006, he was then implicated in the Spanish doping scandal, Operación Puerto, when faxes which seemed to be from Hamilton’s wife, Haven, showed evidence of payments for various performance enhancing drugs. Hamilton finally was able to return to competition in approved races in 2008 and immediately won the U.S. National Championship. But the entire episode took a huge toll on him financially and he and his wife divorced after the strain affected their marriage.
In 2009 Hamilton again failed a doping test and was banned for eight years and he retired from competition, of necessity. In May 2011 he admitted to doping during his career. In August 2012 the IOC disqualified Hamilton from the 2004 Olympics after he had written a letter to IOC President Rogge admitting his doping violations. Later in 2012 he published a book The Secret Race in which he detailed his doping history and implicated many professional riders for widespread doping in the professional peleton.

But the Norwegian was unable to keep the pace. He was eventually passed by his opponent, Michael Hadschieff, and finished seventh. Visser’s teammate, Gerard Kemkers, also started faster in the first half of the race, but did not fade like Karlstad, and finished only one second behind the leading time. In the ninth pair, Gustafson was the last medal contender to skate. He trailed Visser’s time for the entire race, and with one lap to go, Gustafson was 0.87 behind Visser, and even slightly behind Kemkers.

The first East German sleds appeared at the beginning of the 1972-73 winter season and immediately began to produce impressive results with the pairing of the converted javelin thrower Nehmer and decathlete Bernhard Germeshausen finishing in the top six of their maiden World Championships despite minimal experience. The pair continued to improve over the next seasons, although a world medal eluded them, but it was still a surprise when they made their breakthrough at the 1976 Winter Games. Austria II led after the first run but Nehmer recorded the fastest times on the three remaining runs and ran out comfortable winners over Zimmerer piloting West Germany I.

Early in 2004, the favorite for the race seemed to be Davide Rebellin, who won three classics races, Flèche-Wallone, Liège-Bastogne-Liège, and the Amstel Gold Race. But as the summer wore on, his form went off a little. Rather than riding in the hilly country outside of Athens, the race was contested in the city, and the relatively flat course was not difficult enough to break apart the professional peleton. Into the last lap, 40 riders remained together, but a foursome of Paolo Bettini (ITA), Sérgio Paulinho (POR), Axel Merckx (BEL), and Erik Zabel (GER) got away together. On reputation, Zabel was the most highly considered, especially as a sprinter, but Bettini and Paulinho got away to win gold and silver. Merckx, the son of Eddy Merckx, chased their break, but did not catch it, but managed to stay away to win the bronze, with Zabel winning the field sprint. Bettini was a solid professional rider. He had won several classics from 2000-2004, and a stage in the Tour de France in 2000, and he would win the World Championships road race in 2006-07.
Four riders, 3 Americans and a Canadian, were retrospectively disqualified from the race following the investigation into the US Postal team doping scandal.

The Chinese gymnast bettered his qualifying score, however, scoring a massive 16.233 points and taking a big lead. Zou’s team-mate You Hao moved into the bronze medal position with a 15.633. With one final gymnast to perform, the second ranked qualifier, Lukas Dauser of Germany, it looked like another 1-2 for China, but the German had something to say about that and his 15.700 saw him move into the silver medal spot, which relegated You to fourth.

Nobody had stood out in the interim, as the nine medals at the 1953-55 World Championships were won by nine different athletes. In the cross-country steeplechase riding, Hall got off to a good start, placing fourth. The leaders were two Americans, George Lambert and Jack Daniels. But they fell back in the épée fencing. Hall placed fourth with the sword and moved into a big lead after two phases, with 1,924 points, leading two Finns, Väinö Korhonen and Olavi Mannonen. The three would fight it out for the medals for the rest of the event. Hall struggled in the shooting, finishing equal 24th, while Mannonen and Korhonen would tie for fifth, and they moved ahead, Korhonen taking the overall lead over Mannonen, with Hall now fourth, also trailing Hungary’s Gábor Benedek, the 1952 silver medalist.
Hall’s best event was swimming and he placed second in the 300 freestyle, finishing only behind the Soviet Union’s Ivan Deryugin. But Mannonen, Korhonen, and Benedek placed 15th, 16th, and 18th respectively, and Hall moved back into a 41-point lead over Korhonen. In the cross-country run, Hall placed eighth, but of the contenders, only Mannonen finished ahead of him, and just barely in seventh place. It was not enough and allowed Hall to defend his gold medal, with Mannonen placing second, and Korhonen third.

In this event, 32 boarders started with 16 advancing to the single-elimination match racing rounds. The favorite was Sweden’s Richard Richardsson, who had won the 1999 World Championship. The qualifying was led by Swiss boarder Gilles Jaquet, with his teammate, Philipp Schoch, barely making the elimination runs, finishing 15th. In the match racing, the slope was very icy, and in only one run did both boarders finish cleanly. In the first round, Schoch recorded a major upset, defeating Alexander Maier, brother of top alpine skier Hermann “The Hermannator” Maier. Against Schoch, Alexander Maier fell in the first run, and did not finish the second run. The final eventually matched Schoch and Richardsson. Schoch had never made the podium at a major international competition, and Richardsson was expected to win easily, and he won the first run by 0.24 seconds, wearing the helmet of Fritz Strobl, who had won downhill gold in alpine skiing a few days earlier. But on the second run, Richardsson almost fell several times, did not finish, and the gold medal went to Philipp Schoch. Schoch’s brother, Simon, also competed, placing 25th in qualifying. They would return in 2006, and make it to the final together, where Philipp Schoch would defend his title.
The bronze medal came down to America’s Chris Klug against France’s Nicolas Huet. Huet was the reigning World Champion, but was the last qualifier. In the first round against Jaquet, he advanced when Jaquet fell twice. Klug won both races to earn the bronze medal, but had a scare before the second run when the buckle on his left boot broke. A quick fix with duct tape solved the problem for him. For Klug, it was a minor obstacle compared to his previous health issues. In 1993 he was diagnosed with primary sclerosing cholangitis, a liver disease that leads to liver failure. After seven years on the transplant list, he received a liver transplant in 2000. He was back training within two months of that operation and is the only Olympic medalist to have competed after being a transplant recipient.

The other two team members were Brittany Schussler, who had been on the podium at the Berlin World Cup, and the star of the 2006 Games, Cindy Klassen, who had been injured in 2009 and appeared to be past her prime. With the 2008 and 2009 World Champion, Anni Friesinger-Postma out of shape due to an early-season injury, the biggest threat to the Canadians were 2007 World Champion Ireen Wüst (NED) and Martina Sáblíková (CZE), who had recently expanded her domain from the long distances to the 1,500 m.
Friesinger’s rink record of 1:58.66 was first broken by Annette Gerritsen, followed by Nao Kodaira and Margot Boer, the latter setting it to 1:58.10. Then it was Ireen Wüst’s turn, the 3,000 m champion of the Torino Games. She had seen some poor results in the past seasons, Wüst had recorded many good results in sprint, all-round and distance competitions.

While the 1933 and 1934 winners, Tom Askwith of Great Britain and Herbert Buhtz of Germany, were not present, their nations were ably represented by Humphrey Warren and Gustav Schäfer, the former of whom had been runner-up at the 1933 Diamond Sculls. Also in contention was Czechoslovakia’s Jiří Zavřel, the 1935 runner-up. The favorite, however, was probably Switzerland’s Ernst Rufli, who had won the competition in 1935 and 1936. In the opening round, however, Rufli’s time was second to Schäfer’s, although both won their heats by a substantial margin (nearly 21 seconds in Rufli’s case). Warren and Zavřel were in the same heat, but ended up at opposite ends of the ranking, with Zavřel 16 seconds behind Warren’s winning time. The victor in a weak fourth heat was Roger Verey of Poland.
In the semi-finals Schäfer and Rufli again won their heats easily but, despite six of the eight semi-finalists qualifying for the final, Verey and Warren failed to advance; Verey was unable to finish in Schäfer’s heat, while Warren was last in Rufli’s competitive heat, which included Austrian Josef Hasenöhrl and Canadian Charles Campbell. Warren’s time of 8:08.8, however, would have been good enough for second place in Schäfer’s heat. With Zavřel having been eliminated in the repêchage, it looked as if the final would be a race between Germany and Switzerland, but Rufli struggled and placed only fifth. Schäfer thus had an easy victory, finishing well ahead of silver and bronze medalists Josef Hasenöhrl of Austria and Dan Barrow of the United States. The following year Hasenöhrl won the Diamond Sculls and was later killed at the end of World War II in Luxembourg.

Norwegian Bernt Evensen, who had won Olympic medals of each colour already, competed against Irving Jaffee (USA), who had just missed the podium in the 5000 m. The Norwegian led from the start, but Jaffee never trailed by more than three seconds. In the final laps, the American slowly crept closer. With 100 m to go, he was still behind, but with an excellent sprint, he nudged his skate over the finish line first. This was a major upset.
The times of Evensen and Jaffee already indicated the ice conditions were poor, and they were getting worse by the minute. Thaw had set in due to the Swiss Föhn-wind, and puddles of water were forming on the ice by the second race. The third pair saw co-favorite Roald Larsen forfeit when his split times were half a minute behind the leaders. Armand Carlsen, the Norwegian who had bettered the World Record nine days ago (17:17.4) did complete his race, but his time of 20:56.1 was much slower than all others. A clear indicator of the situation was that Carlsen was half a minute slower than Lithuanian Bulota, whom he had beaten by over two minutes in his World Record race. The fifth pair between Andersson of Sweden and Blomqvist of Finland did get underway, but when lap times went over 50 seconds, the referee ended competition. With temperatures having reached 25ºC, there was no chance of the race being resumed the same day. The race results were annulled.
The Americans (and Canadians) protested against this, pointing to poor weather circumstances during the 500 and 5000 m races the previous day. They would accept a postponement but not cancellation. The Swiss organizers then briefly announced Jaffee as the champion, although this message was accompanied by the ambiguous note that “another competition should be held before the close of the Winter sports program”. Their decision was overturned by the International Skating Union, who had the final say in the matter. The American protest was disallowed on grounds that they had submitted it too late, and the race remained cancelled. Briefly, there was hope for a re-run, but when the weather remained warm, most of the competitors left Switzerland, leaving the 10000 m without a winner. Jaffee was somewhat satisfied being congratulated by the Norwegians competitors, who had come to his hotel. He would have his revenge in four years.
Some observers pointed to the Sankt Moritz hotels as the main culprit for the cancellation of the 10000 m. Not wanting to damage their business, they had pressed for the Games to be held late in the season, risking higher temperatures. However, weather records showed that the Föhn had never set in this early in winter.

It was Germany’ third silver in the event after 2006 and 2010, and their first Olympic cross-country skiing medal since relay bronze at Sochi in 2014.
ROC and Germany pulled away from the field early on. Stupak made the first attempt to break, but Sauerbrey ran an incredibly strong second lap and was able to catch up at the first exchange. She wasn’t even part of the World Cup team at the beginning of the season.
Hennig and Nepryayeva were able to keep up the pace, and distance themselves more and more from the other teams. On the penultimate climb, Nepryayeva was able to pull away a little before the next exchange. In the first chasing group were favorites Sweden, with Ebba Andersson, and Norway, with Therese Johaug. Norway had a slight problem after their first runner Tiril Udnes Weng fell, but Johaug pushed Norway into third place, 22.8 seconds behind Victoria Carl.
Carl initially had to let Tatyana Sorina past, but she fought back, as the Russian couldn’t maintain the high pace from the beginning. Carl handed over to Krehl in first place for Germany. The lead over Russia was five seconds, but behind them Norway and Finland, around 15 seconds back, were putting on the pressure.
Krehl, leading at the start of the final leg, could not shake off the Russian sprint specialist Stepanova, who pulled away on the penultimate climb to anchor ROC to a stunning gold. Sweden and Finland came a little bit closer from behind, but Krehl was able to save a small lead of 5.2 seconds to the finish holding off the fast-finishing Jonna Sundling, and Krista Pärmäkoski.
Sweden looked destined to miss out on the medals for most of the race, especially after a disappointing third leg from Frida Karlsson, which saw them slip from third to fifth. However, a strong finish saw Sundling edge out Pärmäkoski in a dramatic final sprint for bronze. Defending champion Norway was shut out of the medals, finishing a disappointing fifth.

The bronze medal went to Agnieszka Czopek, the first swimming medal ever won by a Polish swimmer.
Despite this era of simon-pure amateurism, David Wallechinsky describes in The Complete Book of the Olympics that Schneider later revealed that she had received 20,000 East German marks for her victory, while Davies was stripped of her amateur for receiving $40 for appearing on a television program.

If there was a threat to Chen then it seemed it might possibly come from Mexico’s Paola Espinosa or from her own team mate Hu Yadan but realistically it was Chen’s title to lose.

In the running season, World Cup races had also been won by Dustin Molicki, Derek Parra and Petter Andersen. The latter had shared his victory with Jakko Jan Leeuwangh, who didn’t even make the Dutch team, as had Martin Hersman and Erben Wennemars, also World Cup medalists earlier in the season.
Not among those favorites was Jochem Uytdehaage, whose selection at the Dutch Olympic Trials had been somewhat controversial due to his lack of previous achievements at the distance. But with an Olympic gold medal from the 5,000 m in the pocket, the Dutchman skated the best 1,500 m of his life. With the best final lap of the competition, he broke Lee Gyu-Hyeok’s world record and lowered it to 1:44.57. Of the pre-race favorites, only one man was able to beat this time. Having finished second behind Uytdehaage in the 5,000 m, Derek Parra now took home the gold. A former inline skating World Champion, he had switched to speed skating in 1996 for a chance to compete in the Olympics. Having been an alternate in 1998, his results slowly improved, winning his first international prize at the 2001 World Single Distance Champions; a silver medal in the 1,500 m. He confirmed his status in that event by winning a World Cup race in November 2001, his only international win prior to his Olympic title.
The duel for the bronze was an interesting one, between Søndrål and Joey Cheek. Primarily a sprinter, Cheek had taken off incredibly fast, leading Parra’s splits by four tenths at the bell, and Søndrål by a full 1.75 seconds. As Cheek struggled on the final lap, Søndrål made up for the difference, beating the American by just 0.08 at the finish line.

It was elected to let the heat winners and the three fastest losing boats compete in the final, giving a six-boat final. However, the course only was laid out for four boats, so the heat winners protested and refused to compete.

Kostadinova had been in the lead since the 12th shot and was still in the lead by 0.5 points going into the last shot, but with only a 9.0 from her final shot, her weakest shot of the final, she was overtaken by Batsarashkina who scored a 10.4 to win gold, to go one better than the silver won in Rio. Batsarashkina’s gold was also the first gold medal for the team Russian Olympic Committee and it ended a series of three consecutive wins by China in this event.

Everybody then expected the 50 km. to be a duel between the defending Olympic champion Veikko Hakulinen and the consistent Swede, Sixten Jernberg, which proved to be correct. Jernberg, with two Olympic silver medals already in his pocket, took the command from the start. Starting five minutes behind his arch rival, he had a clear, but not decisive lead at the halfway point, 35 seconds faster than his Finnish rival.

Both of these men had won one of each type of medal at the last three World Championships, but Kolbe had a better all-time record of World Championship titles with five against Karppinen’s two and had also earned a victory in the Diamond Challenge Sculls at the Henley Royal Regatta in 1987. Also in contention was Thomas Lange of East Germany, who came from a nation with a strong rowing tradition and was the reigning World Champion. The reigning Pan American champion, Jesús Posse of Uruguay, was also present in Seoul, as was the 1988 winner of the Diamond Challenge Sculls, Australia’s Hamish McGlashan. Another interesting entry was Dirk Crois of Belgium, who had won silver in the 1984 Olympic double sculls.

Ponor came out next, putting forth a valiant effort to catch up to Raisman, but in the end the American was untouchable and Ponor settled for silver with 15.200 points. No other competitor scored above 15.000, leaving Aliya Mustafina of Russia to capture bronze, her fourth medal of the Olympics after gold on the uneven bars, silver in the team all-around, and bronze in the individual all-around.

Ryun was no longer the dominant runner he had been in 1966-67 and was actually pushed as the top American by Marty Liquori, who had the top time in the world for 1,500 metres in 1971. But Liquori injured his leg and could not even contest the US Olympic Trials. Also a top miler 1972 was Kenyan Ben Jipcho, who had sacrificed himself in the 1968 final to help Keino win gold. He was no longer considered simply a domestique for Keino, but he too was injured and did not compete at München. A few weeks after the US Olympic Trials, Ryun ran 3:52.8, the third fastest mile ever, showing his fitness. The Olympic 1,500 would have three rounds. Ryun and Keino were drawn in the fourth heat of round one. Keino ran near the front, as he often did, while Ryun was in the back of the pack. At 1,000 metres, Ryun’s heel was clipped by Ghana’s Billy Fordjour, and both fell to the track. Ryun got up a few seconds later but was hopelessly behind and did not qualify for the semi-final. As he crossed the line, Keino met him and tried to console him. The US Olympic Committee appealed, claiming Ryun was tripped, but it was not allowed and he was out of the competition.
In the final the way seemed open for Keino to defend his gold medal. Among the 10 finalists, his main competition seemed to be New Zealander Rod Dixon, and the erratic Finlander, Pekka Vasala. His teammate, Mike Boit, also qualified but he was better known as an 800 runner. The pace in the final was slow, but Keino moved to the lead just after 700 metres. He then fired off a 55.1 lap, trying to break down the other runners, but they stayed in contact, the slow early pace leaving them plenty of run. Off the final curve, Vasala moved to Keino’s shoulder and outsprinted him to win the upset gold medal. Keino placed second with Dixon getting the bronze medal.

Torma’s charge to the title was nearly ended in the 2nd round by the skull of his Canadian opponent. Angered by what he considered the unsportsmanlike behaviour of Gerald Blackburn before the fight, Torma bludgeoned his opponent throughout but the coup-de-grace, a left hook, fractured a bone in his hand. The defensive skills of Torma proved sufficient to bring him to the final and a meeting with Hank Herring of the USA.
In a disappointing Olympic Games for the American team, Herring was the only boxer to reach a final but he couldn’t turn silver into gold and Czechoslovakia celebrated their first Olympic boxing title. Torma was born in Hungary and moved to Czechoslovakia after the war. He went on to win the 1949 European title and retired after career of 997 fights with just 60 losses. He won 13 Hungarian and 10 Czech titles. He returned to the Olympic arena twice more but was eliminated at the quarter-final stage on both occasions.
Alessandro D’Ottavio of Italy, the bronze medal winner, was most successful as a professional, winning his national light-heavyweight title whilst Gunnar Hansen, a first round loser, became a legendary figure in Norwegian boxing and was awarded the Olympic Order in bronze for his achievements in and out of the ring.

Wassberg had the advantage of starting behind most of his rivals, with the exception of Zimyatov, starting 1½ minutes behind Wassberg.
The race turned out to be one of the most thrilling duels in the history of 50 km cross-country skiing, with the two Swedes playing the main roles. It was a duel between experience represented by Wassberg and youth represented by Svan. After 7 km Wassberg had a five second lead, while at 19.7 km he had increased his lead to 15 seconds. The Swiss Andi Grünenfelder, starting half a minute ahead of Wassberg, had followed in the Swede’s heels from around 10 km, was in third position, 33 seconds behind, but now struggling to keep Wassberg’s pace. At 32 km Svan struck back, and had a seven second lead over his teammate. Wassberg had on his heels a row of strong skiers that had started ahead of him: the two Finns Aki Karvonen and Harri Kirvesniemi and the Norwegian Jan Lindvall. The trio was able to hang on to Wassberg for almost the rest of the race, but Grünenfelder, still in third place, fell behind. At the last official intermediate point, 44.7 km, Svan was still in the lead, but now with only a one second margin to Wassberg. Karvonen, Kirvesniemi, Grünenfelder and Lindvall followed, but they were far behind the Swedish duo and had to settle for the fight for bronze. Svan was still skiing well, but Wassberg then increased his speed and crossed the line 4.9 seconds ahead of his young rival, the narrowest victory margin in the Olympic 50 km race until mass start was introduced for the distance at the 2006 Games in Torino. Finland’s Karvonen secured the bronze medal, followed by Kirvesniemi. Due to his strong finish, Lindvall passed Grünenfelder on the final stage of the race and advanced to fifth.

Vehovar, meanwhile, had an excellent second run, but it was still 0.43 seconds shy of Fix’s mark and thus the Slovenian had to settle for silver. Becker, meanwhile, improved his score sufficiently to snatch the bronze medal, while Wiley was 34th in the second portion of the tournament and thus placed in fifth on the basis of his original mark.

At the first changeover in the final the USA were out of the medals in fourth and, although over the next two legs they improved, they were still trailing Russia and Germany and a shock defeat appeared likely.
However the two European nations had top loaded their best swimmers whilst the American trump card Gary Hall, Jr. was to swim the anchor leg for the home team. Hall took two seconds off his main rivals and vaulted his team to a clear victory. Their only disappointment was that they failed, by a third of a second, to break the world record.
For Hall this was the first gold medal of the five he won during his career and meant that he followed his father, also Gary Hall, as an Olympic champion.

Both Buaas and Hight needed their second run to qualify. The final was dominated not by Bleiler, as expected, but by Hannah Teter, who posted the top score on both runs.

Australia, winner of the 1983 Champions Trophy won all their matches in the other group. However, both pool winners were unable to make it through the semi-finals, both losing 1-0. The gold medal match was a replay of the 1972 final, between Pakistan and West Germany. As 12 years earlier, the Germans took the lead, but Pakistan quickly tied and held on until full time. The first Olympic hockey final to go into overtime was finally decided by Kalimullah of Pakistan.
Remarkably, the third hockey gold for Pakistan had strong ties with the two earlier ones in 1960 and 1968.

Mark Spitz was to swim the butterfly leg, the third leg, for the American team in the final. He had already won six gold medals in Munich, having won the 100 freestyle the day before. The United States’ team was the overwhelming favorite and the only way they could lose, it was thought, was to false start or take off early on an exchange. Unsurprisingly, however, East Germany led on the opening backstroke leg, as Roland Matthes, the top backstroker in the world, set a world 100 metre backstroke record with 56.30, as American Mike Stamm was 1.67 seconds back in second place. But Tom Bruce made up the margin on the breaststroke leg, giving Spitz a slight lead, as he and East German Hartmut Flöckner started the butterfly leg almost together. So much for that race. Spitz beat Flöckner by over two seconds in the butterfly, and anchor freestyler Jerry Heidenreich poured it on for the US, winning for four seconds over East Germany in a world record 3:48.16.
For Mark Spitz it had been a pretty good Olympics. Seven events. Seven gold medals. Seven world records. His Olympic total from 1968 and 1972 increased to 11 Olympic medals and 9 gold medals. The day after the medley relay, Palestine terrorists from the Black September group would attack the Israeli Olympic team in the Olympic Village, eventually killing 11 of them. The Olympics and world sport would never be the same. Mark Spitz was Jewish and quickly left Munich, fearing for his fame and his heritage.

The lead was then taken over by the unlikely figure of Pavol Hurajt, a Slovakian who had competed at the top level for a decade but whose only previous podium finishes at World Cup level had come six years earlier. With a flawless shooting display Hurajt was the leader from around the half way stage and maintained that lead until after the final shooting phase.

None of the other teams in the group won more than three of their five matches. Spain finished as runners-up in the group on goal difference, with Argentina third. Despite China defeating New Zealand 3-2 in their final group match, it was not enough for China to qualify, and New Zealand advanced to the quarter-finals ahead of China on goal difference.
The surprise of the quarter-finals was the defeat of Australia by India, Gurjit Kaur scoring the only goal of the game from a penalty corner. In another close encounter, holders Great Britain defeated Spain in a shoot-out (2-0), following a 2-2 draw in their match. There were much easier wins for Argentina (3-0 against Germany) and the Netherlands (3-0 against New Zealand.)
The first semi-final was a repeat of the 2016 final when the Netherlands played Great Britain; however, this was a very one sided contest, Felice Albers and Marloes Keetels scoring two quick goals for the Netherlands in the second quarter. Further goals from Maria Verschoor, on a penalty corner, and a second goal from Albers put the Netherlands in control. Giselle Ansley managed to score a consolation goal for Great Britain before Frederique Matla converted a penalty corner in the final quarter to make the winning score 5-1. The second semi-final was a much closer affair, and a shock looked possible when India scored in the second minute, through a penalty corner by Gurjit Kaur, but goals from two penalty corners scored by Noel Barrionuevo ensured that Argentina progressed to the final by a score of 2-1.
As with the men’s competition, the bronze medal match was a thriller. Following a goalless first quarter, Great Britain went into a 2-0 lead with goals by Ellie Rayer and Sarah Robertson. India hit back, however, with two goals from penalty corners by Gurjit Kaur, and then went into the lead in the closing minute of the quarter when Vandana Katariya scored to give India a 3-2 lead. Britain equalised through Hollie Webb-Pearne in the third quarter and went into the lead through Grace Balsdon from a penalty corner, so the 2016 winners Great Britain finished with the bronze medal.
The final was a more one-sided affair as the Netherlands won gold for 4th time. All the goal action occurred in the second quarter. Goals from Margot van Geffen and two from Caia van Maasakker, all from penalty corners, gave the Netherlands a commanding 3-0 lead. Agustina Gorzelany pulled a goal back for Argentina in the last second of the quarter. Following this the Netherlands were in control and rarely looked like conceding, winning the match 3-1, continuing their record of having won a medal at each Games since 1996.

9000633,"Singles, Women",2018 Winter Olympics,60,Figure Skating,/editions/60/sports/FSK,21 – 23 February 2018,"Gangneung Ice Arena, Gangneung Olympic Park, Coastal Cluster, Gangneung",30 from 20 countries,Total of points from short program and free skating.,na,"The ladies singles at the 2018 Olympic Winter Games was held on 21 February (short program) and 23 February (free skate) at the Gangneung Ice Arena with 30 women from 20 nations.
Prior to the start of the 2018 Olympic Winter Games, the competition for gold was thought to be a coronation for Russian Yevgeniya Medvedeva as she would skate unchallenged to the top of the podium based on her previous season – until toward the end of 2017, when she broke her foot. That opened the door for fellow Russian teenager, 2017 World Junior champion Alina Zagitova.  The Canadians also had a few contenders to offer a legitimate challenge to the Russians having had two women on the podium at the 2017 World Championships – silver medalist Kaetlyn Osmond, who was also the 2014 Olympic team silver medalist, and 2014 Olympian Gabrielle Daleman, reigning World bronze medalist. Both were members of the gold medal winning Canadian team in the first week of the Games.
The glamour event of the Winter Olympics was once dominated by American women, who had accounted for 19 of a possible 45 Olympic medals in the ladies singles from 1952 through 2006. The Americans won no medals at the Olympics of 2010 and 2014, and had only made the podium once in the last 11 World Championships, which was Ashley Wagner’s home-soil silver in 2016. The American’s were missing her in PyeongChang after she finished fourth at the US Olympic Trials.
The short program was dominated by the rising Russian teenage stars. Zagitova had edged her rival and training partner, two-time World champion Medvedva, to top the ranking with a world record 82.92 points to Medvedva’s 81.61 points. Both left all three of their jumping passes for the second half of their program, which earned them bonus points. Osmond finished in third with 78.87 points, her season’s best score.
In the free skate, Zagitova skated to “Don Quixote”, with all 11 of her jumps back-loaded in the second half of her program on “tired legs” thus producing a 10% bonus per jump. She lead the scoring with 156.65 points, just two points shy of setting a second world record at the Games. Her combined score of 239.57 points was enough to capture the gold medal, just 1.36 points ahead of reigning World champion Medvedeva, who skated to the music of Tolstoy’s “Anna Karenina” for the silver (238.26 points).
At 15 years and 281 days of age, not only did Zagitova became one of the youngest figure skating Olympic champions ever (Tara Lipinski was 15 years 8 months in 1998), she was also the first athlete who was born in the 21st century to win a gold medal.
Osmond, who finished 13th at the 2014 Olympic Winter Games in Sochi, who skated to music from “Black Swan,” scored 152.15 points in her long program for a combined score of 231.02 points to capture the bronze medal. Canada hadn’t won an Olympic medal in women’s singles since Joannie Rochette claimed bronze at the 2010 Vancouver Games.
At the medal ceremony, the two Russians watched the Olympic flag being raised in their honour (instead of the Russian flag), and heard the Olympic hymn played (instead of the Russian anthem).

1021,"500 metres, Men",1968 Winter Olympics,38,Speed Skating,/editions/38/sports/SSK,14 February 1968 — 10:00,"L'Anneau de Vitesse, Grenoble",48 from 17 countries,na,na,"The defending champion was the United States’ Terry McDermott, who had not competed outside the United States since the 1964 Winter Olympics. Although speed skating had always been contested by all-around skaters, by the late 1960s it was becoming more common for skaters to specialize either as sprinters or distance skaters. One such skater was German Erhard Keller who had competed at the 1966 and 1967 World Championships, but came to the fore as a sprinter in early 1968, winning the 500 at the World Winter University Games in January, and later in the month, breaking the world record at Inzell with a time of 39.2. Keller was the favorite with McDermott an unknown factor. The early leader came out of the third pair, Norway’s Magne Thomassen, who had won the 500 at the 1964 European Championships and finished in 40.5. Five more pairs went thru, and Keller then presented himself in the ninth pair, posting a 40.3 to take the lead. The lead seemed safe, mostly because it was a warm day and the ice was melting, making conditions very difficult for the later skaters. It most affected Terry McDermott, who went off in the 24th, and final, pair. Inexplicably, though no other skater in the last five pairs bettered 41.6, McDermott finished in 40.5 to tie Thomassen for the silver medal. Keller was gracious in victory, stating, “What [McDermott] did today was just sheer guts. If he had started in the earlier heats while the ice was still good, I’d have lost. It’s as simple as that.” But Keller was no fluke, as he would continue to win sprints over the next five years. He won the 1971 World Sprint championships, and won 500 distance titles at the 1969 and 1970 European Championships, the 1970 World Winter University Games, and in 1972, he would return to the Olympics and defend his gold medal.

A team event over this distance had been contested in 1900.  The distance was rarely run internationally, and neither America nor Britain had contested a 5,000 metre or 3-mile championship as of 1912.
Finland’s Hannes Kolehmainen had won the 10,000 metres the day before the first round of this event but he was not pressed in winning heat four to advance to the final.  In the final, Kolehmainen and France’s Jean Bouin quickly pulled away from the field.  For the remainder of the race, until the final straight, Bouin led with Kolehmainen on his heels.  Finally, after repeated attempts to pass Bouin, Kolehmainen pulled ahead only 20 metres from the finish.  The two leaders shattered the previous world record, as nobody had previously broken 15 minutes for the distance.
In September 1914, both Bouin and the bronze medalist, Britain’s George  Hutson were killed in World War I.

All fighters losing to the finalists in each pool advance to repêchage tournament for the bronze medal.,na,"Joel González of Spain had stepped up a division since winning the flyweight gold medal at London 2012 and was optimistic about winning a second gold, particularly after winning silver in the 63kg class at the 2015 World Championships. A strong favourite for the featherweight title, however, was Turkey’s Servet “The Cheetah” Tazegül, who won in 2012 and was the reigning European and World 68kg Champion, but there were plenty of others to pick from. Seeded one place above Tazegül, in fourth place, was Russia’s Aleksey Denisenko, who the Turk beat in the 2015 world final in what was described as one of the all-time great taekwondo matches and one many would like to see repeated as the 2016 Olympic final.
The number one seed, and 2015 63kg world champion, was Belgium’s Jaouad Achab, a flamboyant fighter who was great to watch despite being a bit too light in this 68kg category. The experienced South Korean Lee Dae-Hun was number two seed and was a silver medallist in 2012 behind the Spaniard González. The third seed Saúl Gutiérrez of Mexico was a 63kg bronze medallist at the 2015 worlds and he was tall, which is a big advantage for attempting head kicks.
Unlike the first day of completion, when the favourites fell by the wayside in the early part of competition, the 68kg class went much to form with Gutiérrez being the only one of the top six seeds to fall in the first round. The fans got the re-run of the Tazegül – Denisenko contest in the quarter-final but, unlike the World Championship final, it was far from a classic as the Russian ran out a 19-6 winner on the points gap rule in the second round.
In the first repêchage, Tazegül, the now deposed defending champion and number five seed, was defeated by 13th seed Edgar Contreras of Venezuela in the golden point sudden-death after a 4-4 tie. The first of the bronze medal matches saw Contreras against González hold out for a 4-3 win. The other bronze medal match was between the number one and two seeds, Jaouad Achab and Lee Dae-Hun, and it was a great contest which Lee won 11-7, but the scoreline does not tell the full story of a match that saw the lead change hands several times in the first two rounds.
In the gold medal match, the fourth seed Denisenko had impressed all day with his wide array of skills, whilst the tenth seed Jordanian Ahmad Abughaush had become a favourite of the fans with his footwork and variety of kicks; thus the final was between two men of different contrasts. The Jordanian opened up a one point lead in round two after a scoreless opening round, but that one point was all that separated the two men at the end of the round. Abughaush built up a lead of 7-2 and then 10-2 in the third round by which time it looked over and despite a late flourish from the Russian, Jordan won their first ever Olympic medal in any sport, thanks to Abughaush’s 10-6 win.

70829,"Individual All-Around, Men",2004 Summer Olympics,26,Artistic Gymnastics,/editions/26/sports/GAR,14 – 18 August 2004,"Olympiako Kleisto Gymnastirio, Olympiako Athletiko Kentro Athinon Spiros Loues, Maroussi",98 from 31 countries,na,na,"The format was different in 2004, with only 24 men advancing to the final round from the team qualifying, with no more than two allowed from any nations. Qualifying scores did not carry over to the final round. Previously, there were 36 finalists, with three allowed from each nation. This format had been used at the 2003 World Championships, although it had actually been used at the 1993 Worlds as well, but the format reverted to the 36/3 rule from 1995-2001. American Paul Hamm had won the all-around at the 2003 Worlds and came to Athinai as the favorite. He would eventually win the gold medal but in the most controversial men’s gymnastic event ever.
Hamm led the qualifying round, and he took an early lead in the final round. On his fourth rotation, however, the vault, Hamm missed his landing, scoring only 9.137 points and dropping to 12th place. He and his coach conferred and decided if he could score 9.8s on the final two rotations, he might be able to salvage a bronze medal. He then performed one of his best parallel bars routines ever, scoring 9.837 to move back into fourth place. The leaders after five rotations were the two Koreans, Kim Dae-Eun and Yang Tae-Yeong. Yang’s fifth rotation had been on parallel bars, on which he scored 9.712, but this would ignite the controversy.
Kim opened the final rotation on the floor exercise and scored 9.650 to remain in the lead, especially when Yang missed a grip on a pirouette on the high bar and scored only 9.475. Hamm then followed Yang on the high bar and nailed the routine, thinking he had secured the bronze medal, but when his score of 9.837 was posted, he had won the gold. At least it seemed he had.
Then the arguments began. The Koreans protested that on the parallel bars, Yang’s start value had been re-assigned as 9.9 instead of the 10.0 they felt it deserved. They approached the head judge, George Beckford, of the United States, who waved them off and discounted the complaint, stating that the start value was correct. The Korean officials then appealed to the A-panel judges, Bultrago Reyes of Colombia and Benjamin Bango of Spain. They reviewed the notes and spotted an error. Yang’s listed elements had included a Morisue (double back to upper arms) while it was actually a Belle (giant to double back to upper arms), and the difference would have increased his start value by 0.10 points, or up to the 10.0 the Koreans were claiming.
The Koreans claimed that Yang should be given the gold medal but the Americans also noted that Yang had made a mistake on his parallel bars routine, performing 4 hangs, although only 3 were allowed, and he had not been penalized for this. Had this error been noted, he would have had a 0.2 penalty and would have had a lower total score, even if the start value were corrected.
The Korean Olympic Committee disregarded this argument, stating that other gymnasts were not penalized for this, and then protested to the Fédération Internationale de Gymnastique (FIG), which refused to hear it, stating that it was after the competition, and noting that their rules required all protests to be filed during the competition. Two days later the FIG Executive Committee reviewed the case and released a statement noting that Yang’s start value should have been 10.0, but did not change the results, although they suspended the three judges responsible.
Bruno Grandi, FIG President, then wrote a letter to Paul Hamm, sending it via the US Olympic Committee, in which Grandi urged Hamm to return the gold medal and give it to Yang. Grandi wrote, “I wish to remind you that the FIG Executive Committee has admitted the error of judgement made on the Parallel Bars and suspended the three responsible judges, two from the A panel and the FIG Technical Committee member. Indeed, the start value of the Korean gymnast Yang Tae Young was given as 9.9 instead of 10. As a result, the true winner of the All-Around competition is Yang Tae Young. If, (according to your declarations to the press), you would return your medal to the Korean if the FIG requested it, then such an action would be recognised as the ultimate demonstration of Fairplay by the whole world. The FIG and the IOC would highly appreciate the magnitude of this gesture. At this moment in time, you are the only one who can make this decision.”
The US Olympic Committee was not pleased with this letter from Grandi and refused to forward it to Hamm. Their response to Grandi included the following, “Your letter states ‘the IOC would highly appreciate the magnitude of this gesture.’ You should know that upon receipt of your letter, we immediately contacted the International Olympic Committee and its President, Dr. Jacques Rogge, which expressed its displeasure over the fact the FIG would even consider placing an athlete in such an untenable position and strongly stated they do not support the letter or its contents. Mr. Grandi, it is important to remind you that your own Federation rules, and your own public statements, clearly indicate that Mr. Hamm is the Olympic gold medalist in the 2004 Individual Men’s All-Around. We share and support that viewpoint. The statement in your letter that ‘the true winner of the All-Around competition is Yang Tae Young’ is not only inconsistent with your rules and public statements, it is incorrect and undermines the very spirit of the Olympic Games. As stewards of the Olympic movement, we all share a responsibility to protect, and not sacrifice, the interests of athletes. We encourage you and other individuals within FIG, who saw this as an appropriate remedy, to begin taking that responsibility more seriously. Once again, we urge you to immediately retract this unacceptable request.”
The Korean officials and Yang were not yet done. They then appealed the decision to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS). A hearing was held in Lausanne, Switzerland on 27 September 2004 at which Hamm and the US Olympic Committee appeared. On 21 October the CAS announced their decision which supported Hamm, allowing him to keep the gold medal. The ruling noted, “An error identified with the benefit of hindsight, whether admitted or not, cannot be a ground for reversing a result of a competition…. However, quite apart from the consideration that no one can be certain how the competition in question would have turned out had the official’s decision been different, for a Court to change the result would on this basis still involve interfering with a field of play decision. Each sport may have within it a mechanism for utilizing modern technology to ensure a correct decision is made in the first place (e.g. cricket with run-outs) or for immediately subjecting a controversial decision to a process of review (e.g. gymnastics) but the solution for error, either way, lies within the framework of the sport’s own rules.” They also noted that the Korean protest was not made before the end of the competition, as required by FIG rules.
So the final result was 1) Paul Hamm (USA); 2) Kim Dae-Eun (KOR); 3) Yang Tae-Young (KOR). Pretty simple, eh?

He was one of the hottest favorites for the 30 km Olympic gold in Sapporo, but started rather slowly and was lying in seventh place after 10 km, almost half a minute behind the leader, his teammate Fyodor Simashov, who was the bronze medalist at 15 km at the 1970 World Championships. In second place, four seconds behind Simashev, was another Soviet skier, Vladimir Dolganov, followed by the Norwegian Johs  Harviken, another four seconds behind. But now Vedenin started his move. At 20 km he was in the lead, 11 seconds ahead of the Norwegian Pål Tyldum, who had advanced from sixth to second position. Gunnar Larsson from Sweden had moved from fifth to third, and Harviken was close behind, still among the medal contenders. Dolganov had dropped to sixth and Simashev to seventh, seemingly out of the medal struggle. Vedenin finished strongly and won the first ever Olympic cross-country gold for a Soviet man with a margin of over 54 seconds. The fight for the other medals was very tight between the two Norwegians and Larsson. Harviken, starting half a minute behind his Swedish rival, had a strong finish and beat Larsson’s final time by just over one second. Tyldum, starting last of all the competitors, was able to stay ahead of his countryman and won the silver medal, defeating Harviken by seven seconds. The West German veteran Walter Demel, starting in his third Winter Olympics, finished strongly to finish in fifth place.

Ties broken by lightest bodyweight.,na,"Zhou Jun, like most Chinese weightlifters at the 2012 Summer Olympics, was the favorite for the gold medal in her division, the women’s featherweight. As a 17 year-old rookie with no major international medals to her name, however, she was far from a lock and was expected to be challenged by several competitors including Zulfiya Chinshanlo of Kazakhstan, World Champion in 2009 and 2011, and  Cristina Iovu of Moldova, the reigning European Champion. Zhao’s most distinguished opponent, however, was possibly Aylin Daşdelen of Turkey, four-time European Champion (2002, 2003, 2010, 2011) and thrice runner-up (2004, 2009, 2012), runner-up at the two most recent World Championships, and fourth-place finisher at the 2004 Games (although some of these feats, including her previous Olympic appearance, came in the lightweight category).
Zhao failed in her first three snatch attempts at 95 kg, further opening up the competition for the Olympic crown. The snatch competition went to Iovu with 99 kg, followed by Hsu Shu-Ching of Chinese Taipei, a bronze medalist at the most recent World Championships, with 96 kg, and Chinshanlo with 95 kg. Approaching the end of the event, Iovu moved into the gold medal position with a 120 kg lift in her second attempt, while Hsu failed at her first attempt of 123 kg, which would have tied their total lifts and placed Hsu in first by virtue of her lower body weight. Hsu was then successful in her final attempt, putting her in the gold medal position. Daşdelen, who had been in a three-way tie for fourth with 91 kg, failed at her first attempt of 124 kg in the clean and jerk, but Chinshanlo, the world record holder in the clean and jerk with 130 kg, lifted 125 kg with ease to slide into first place. Iovu then attempted to lift 125 kg, which would have put her well into the lead, but failed and faced being knocked off the podium entirely with Chinshanlo already in the gold medal position and two lifts left from Daşdelen.
Daşdelen needed a 129 kg lift, three kilograms higher than the previous Olympic record set by 2008 champion Prapawadee Jaroenrattanatarakoon of Thailand, just to tie Chinshanlo, although the Turk’s higher body weight would still have relegated her to silver. The Turk failed at this weight on her second attempt, apparently injuring her elbow in the process, and did not appear for her third try, which eliminated her from the competition. Chinshanlo, already assured of the gold, set a world record with a 131 kg lift in her second lift, the first broken record of 2012 Olympics. Her third attempt, this time at 135 kg, failed, but this was irrelevant: Chinshanlo had distinguished herself not only as a world record holder, but as a true Olympic champion.
Controversy brewed almost immediately after her victory, however, when Chinese media began insisting that Chinshanlo was actually a Chinese national named Zhao Changling who had been loaned to Kazakhstan for a five year period beginning in 2008. Chinshanlo denied this, but drew scrutiny in October 2012 when the Chinese media claimed that she was in the process of preparing documents to return to China. She again refuted this, saying that she only planned to visit a former coach, but rumors swirled that Chinshanlo’s objective was to train worthy competition in other countries, as China had done in the past by loaning out its table tennis players.
That was how the event and the results seemed to have ended. In 2015, however, the IOC began re-testing samples from the 2008 Beijing and 2012 London Olympics, using newer, more advanced testing techniques, in an effort to find those who had used performance enhancing drugs (PEDs), but in whom it could not be detected at the time of those Olympics. This was one of the many events affected. Every women’s weightlifting event at the 2012 London Olympics, except flyweight (≤ 48 kg), was affected by positive re-tests.
In October 2016 original gold medalist Zulfiya Chinshanlo (KAZ) lost her medal for a positive re-test for oxandrolone and stanozolol. In November 2016 original bronze medalist Cristina Iovu (MDA) lost her medal for a positive re-test for turinabol (dehydrochloromethyltestosterone). The medals were re-assigned as follows: Gold – Hsu Shu-Ching (TPE); Silver – Citra Febrianti (INA); Bronze – Yuliya Paratova (UKR). Febrianti received her medal at a ceremony in Indonesia in September 2022.

Ties broken by lightest bodyweight.,na,"As winner of the last two World Championships, and runner-up in the previous one, Wu Jingbiao of China was a clear favorite for the gold medal in the men’s bantamweight weightlifting event at the 2012 Summer Olympics. His closest competitor was thought to be Valentin Xristov of Azerbaijan, reigning European Champion and bronze medalist at the most recent World Championships. Before either weightlifter even had a chance to compete, however, they had already lost the gold medal. Wu and Xristov, competing in the “A” group, were unable to reach the bar set by Om Yun-Chol of North Korea in the “B” pool, which was usually reserved for participants outside of the top ten. Om, who had never medalled in a major international competition, became the fifth man ever to lift three times his own bodyweight with a lift of 168 kg in the clean and jerk, beating the Olympic record by 1 kilogram and tying the world one, both set by Halil Mutlu of Turkey. Although he would only have the joint sixth-highest lift in the snatch after all competitors had gone, his total lift was never surpassed.
Wu did not attempt to challenge Om on his first lift. Having won the snatch portion with a weight of 133 kg, he needed a lift of 160 kg, the same as Om’s first lift, to move into gold medal position. He called for 156 kg, enough to move into second place, but even in this he was unsuccessful until his second attempt. There was a potential for Khalil Maaoui of Tunisia to challenge for gold as well, as he had lifted only one kilogram less than Wu in the snatch, but he withdrew from the clean and jerk before his attempt. Xristov, who had been relegated to bronze following Wu’s lift, failed at 158 kg, and was surpassed by Vietnam’s Trần Lê Quốc Toàn, who lifted 159 kg in his second attempt. Xristov, with a 2 kilogram advantage in the snatch, responded with a 159 kg lift of his own that went unanswered by Trần, who failed at a final attempt at 162 kg. Wu failed in his attempt at 161 kg, which would have been sufficient for the gold, meaning that no one was able to top even Om’s first lift in the clean and jerk.

Surprisingly, however, it was Spain who had the fastest time in the opening round, despite East Germany being in the more difficult heat that included the Soviet Union. Nonetheless, the East Germans won their heat ahead of a lacklustre effort from the Soviets, who were even bested by an unheralded Polish crew.

Alf was still competing by the 1984 Sumer Olympics, but Frank had retired, meaning that the remaining Hansen brother had to find a new partner, which he did in the form of Rolf Thorsen. This duo had found some success, winning the 1982 World Championships, coming runner-up in the 1983, and earning bronze in 1981, but Alf was never as dominant as he had been with Frank. East Germany, meanwhile, had won the World Championships in 1981 and 1983 with different lineups but was not present in Los Angeles. Canada, victors at the most recent Pan American Games, was represented by Tim Storm (a 1979 champion) and Peter MacGowan, as Robert Mills, one of the two reigning champions, was participating in the single sculls and the other, Philip Haggerty, did not attend the 1984 Games.
The opening heats went to Andreas Schmelz and Georg Agrikola of West Germany, the reigning World bronze medalists, who had the fastest time overall, and the Belgian duo of Dirk Crois and Pierre-Marie Deloof, which was somewhat surprising as Belgium had never won a medal in this event at the World Championships, and only Crois had international experience as a senior. Even more surprising was the elimination of Hansen and Thorsen in the repêchage, which left the final wide open. The pair from the United States, Bradley Lewis and Paul Enquist, took advantage of this and pushed forward to win the first Olympic rowing gold medal for the United States since 1964. The Belgian duo captured silver while Yugoslavia’s Zoran Pančić and Milorad Stanulov,the 1980 Olympic runners-up, earned bronze. Along with Ann Haesebrouck’s bronze in the women’s single sculls, Belgium’s second-place finish was one of its first two Olympic rowing medals since Michel Knuysen and Bob Baetens took silver in the coxless pairs in 1952.

The overwhelming favorite was Mark Spitz who had announced plans to win seven gold medals in seven events at the 1972 Olympics. Since 1967 he had set eight world records in the event, and was considered unbeatable in this one. After recording the fastest qualifier in the morning Spitz streaked to the wall on the first lap, opening a lead of 1.45 seconds in the first 50 metres over teammate Gary Hall. Hall actually stayed close on the second lap, Spitz reaching the halfway mark in 57.79, and the third lap. But by the final 50 Spitz was too strong and he powered home to win by over two seconds, setting a world record of 2:00.70. Hall was a comfortable silver medal winner, with American Robin Backhaus completing a sweep for the US. One down for Spitz. Six to go. Forty minutes later, Spitz would swim in the final of the 4 x 100 freestyle relay, winning his second gold medal. The game was on.

In the Paris-Toulouse-Paris, the drivers drove from Vincennes to Montgeron, where they departed for the timed part of the race at 3:07 in the morning, with two-minute intervals between the contestants, covering a course from Paris to Toulouse and back, whose distance is variably mentioned at 1,347 to 1,443 km. The race took place in three stages over three days – Paris-Toulouse, Toulouse-Limoges, Limoges-Paris. Fifty-five (55) vehicles started the three Paris-Toulouse-Paris events, from 78 entrants, but only 21 finished, with 9 cars, 9 motorcycles, and 3 small cars (voiturettes) making it to the finish line, although only 18 had a time recorded.
Paris-Toulouse-Paris was one of the major races that year, second only to the first Gordon Bennett race. The major events of the previous years had been divided between René De Knijff, who won Paris-Bordeaux 1898, and Tour de France Automobile in 1899; and Fernand Charron, who won the 1898 Paris-Amsterdam-Paris, the 1899 Paris-Bordeaux, and the 1900 Gordon Bennett race. Charron did not compete at the Paris Exposition due to illness.
The winner was Alfred Velghe, competing as Levegh, who finished more than one hour ahead of Arthur Pinson. Velghe received a prize of 8,000 francs and a gold medal for winning, from a total purse of 30,000 francs. He was one of the pioneer car racers in France, who started that avocation in 1898, and always raced as Levegh, an anagram of his surname. When Velghe/Levegh won the race, he lit up a victory cigar.
Velghe’s nephew, Pierre Boullion, later used the same pseudonym during his racing career. Pierre Levegh is mostly known for the infamous accident at the 1955 24-Hours of Le Mans, when his crash caused the death of more than 80 spectators and himself.

Matos led late in the second round, when he took an injury time-out. But while recovering, he was disqualified by Swedish referee Chakir Chelbat, who felt that Matos had taken too much time. This was not well received by Matos or his coach, Leodis González, who vociferously protested the call. Matos then kicked Chelbat in the face before he had to be escorted out by security. Matos’s disqualification was upheld, and he and his coach were further given lifetime bans from the sport for their behavior.
After that episode the final was anticlimactic. Nikolaidis took an early lead, but Cha evened the match in the final round and then won the gold medal with a late kick.

After surviving a close encounter with the host nation, the Italians proceeded to the final by easily overcoming the United States, 45-39. The Chinese, however, didn’t make it past their first match. They were upset by the Japanese (seeded 7th), with Kenta Chida deciding the match with his 10-3 win over Ma Jianfei. The Japanese then encountered the Germans in the semi-finals, which turned out to be a thriller. The Asians had a 3 point lead going into the last bout, which saw 2008 silver medallist Yuki Ota pitted against 4-time World Champion Peter Joppich of Germany. Joppich closed the gap to 40-40, forcing overtime, and twice seemed to have scored the winning touch. Video replay decided otherwise, however, and Ota eventually scored the winning touch. The final began well for Japan, but individual world champion Andrea Cassarà reversed this in his bout against Chida. Although Japan never lost touch, Italy remained in control, with Andrea Baldini deciding the match in their favor and defending their 2004 title, as the event wasn’t held in Beijing. For Japan, it was their second-ever Olympic fencing medal, the first one won by Ota in 2008.

She came to the Mexico City Olympics as the favorite, having won the 1966 World Championships, although Soviet Nataliya Kuchinskaya was close at the 1966 Worlds in Dortmund, Germany. In Mexico City, it was not close, as Čáslavská won easily over Kuchinskaya’s teammate, Zinaida Voronina, the wife of Mikhail Voronin, who was also second in the men’s all-around in 1968. Kuchinskaya won the bronze medal. To top things off for her, at the end of the 1968 Olympics, Čáslavská got married after the competition ended, marrying Josef Odložil, who won a silver medal in Mexico in the 1,500 metre run.
However, Čáslavská almost did not compete at the 1968 Olympics. In April 1968 she had signed the “Manifesto of 2000 Words,” which opposed Soviet involvement in Czechoslovakia. In August 1968, the Soviet Union invaded Prague to put down Czechoslovak protests. Čáslavská was warned she could be arrested and fled to the mountains, where she trained on her own in the fields and forests. She was eventually allowed to compete at the Olympics, but the Soviets did not forget. She never was able to obtain a coaching job in Czechoslovakia, and remained unemployed. She was told to renounce her support of the manifesto, but continually refused. She later coached the Mexican team from 1979-81 but on her return to Czechoslovakia, the restrictions on her were kept in place. After the fall of the Eastern Bloc in 1989, Čáslavská’s brave support of her principles became an asset, and she eventually became President of the Czech Olympic Committee and a member of the IOC.
Life was not much better for Zinaida Voronina, though for far less noble reasons. She and her husband won 10 gymnastics medals in Mexico City, but Zinaida later turned to alcohol abuse, her husband divorced her, she lost custody of her son, and she was only able to obtain work as a manual laborer, a job she also lost because of her alcoholism. Voronina eventually died in 2001, when only 53-years-old, due to alcohol-related causes.

In 1982 he was the Commonwealth and European Champion at 1,500 and in 1983, he won the inaugural World Championship in the 1,500 metres. The three British favorites were joined in Los Angeles by the top US miler since Jim Ryun, Steve Scott. Scott finished second to Cram at the World Athletics Championship, but led the 1983 world mile list with 3:49.21, set at the ISTAF Meet in Berlin on 17 August. The only significant miler who would not be in Los Angeles was South African Johan Fourie, third on the world-list for the year, but who could not compete because South Africa was still banned from international sports.
Though the Soviet Union led an Eastern European boycott of Los Angeles, in retribution for the 1980 American-led boycott, that hardly affected the 1,500 because the big British three and Scott were all available. All four made it thru the two rounds and presented for the final. Coe had earlier won the 800 metre gold medal, while Ovett was felt to be struggling with asthma problems. Scott and Cram qualified comfortably. After a first lap in 58.85, Scott moved to the front on the backstretch, trying to push the pace and take kick out of the Britons. He led thru 800 in 1:57.06, but then was passed by Spain’s José Manuel Abascal, who led at the bell. Coe and Cram were on his shoulder. Coe took control on the backstretch and powered ahead to victory. He ran the last 200 in a stunning 26.1, holding off Cram (silver) and Abascal (bronze). His time of 3:32.53 finally bettered Kip Keino’s Olympic record from 1968. Ovett could not finish the race because of his respiratory problems.

Hungary won the water polo title at the 1926 meet, followed by Sweden and Germany. Germany and Hungary were in Amsterdam for the 1928 Olympics but for some reason, Sweden did not participate. Germany and Hungary advanced to the final of the single-elimination tournament, with Germany upsetting the Magyars, 5-2 in overtime, for the gold medal, Hungary taking silver. This was the first of 12 consecutive Olympics at which Hungary would earn a water polo medal.
The defending Olympic champions France advanced to the third-place tournament, after losing in the semi-finals to Hungary. France won three matches to take the bronze medal, shutting out Argentina 8-0 in the final match of the consolation event. The details of how the third-place tournament was contested are confusing. It was apparently to be held by the Bergvall System, in which all those losing to the winner and runner-up contested a tournament for 3rd-place. But that system was not followed precisely and even Dutch and French newspapers mention that the organizers did not know how to follow the Bergvall System.

He would be opposed by two Soviet lifters, Trofim Lomakin and Arkady Vorobyov. Vorobyov had won silver at the 1950 World Championships, lifting the same total as Stanczyk, but losing on bodyweight. In the end this event degenerated into a Cold War contest, with American and Soviet officials arguing about the legality of each other’s lifts. Stanczyk took the lead after a 127.5 kg press, which the Soviets contested, but the judges ruled in Stanczyk’s favor. All three lifted 127.5 kg in the snatch, leaving Stanczyk in the lead entering the clean & jerk, but he was bested by Lomakin in the clean & jerk, who lifted 165.0 kg to Stanczyk’s 160.0 kg.
Vorobyov attempted to win gold with 170.0 kg, but on his initial approach to the bar, lifted it only a few inches and dropped it. This started a commotion as the officials argued if this counted as a lift. Vorobyov tried again and lifted the weight overhead and then released it, only to have two judges reject the lift. He left the stage and went to the dressing room, but his coach returned to tell him he was being awarded another lift. He had to dress, warm-up, and hurry out to the platform, and he failed badly on the final attempt, as the Soviet officials continued to argue that his previous lift had been clean. After all the arguing, the podium positions were Lomakin 1st, Stanczyk 2nd, and Vorobyov 3rd. Vorobyov would move up in class and win gold as a middle-heavyweight in 1956 and 1960.

Formerly known as Heather Richardson, she had married the 2014 Olympic champion in the 10,000 m, Jorrit Bergsma. Apart from the 2017 World title, Heather Bergsma had also won all six World Cup races she raced in, as well as the overall title and a 2nd place in the World Sprint Championships. In the Olympic season, though, Bergsma showed less form. She did win one World Cup, but that was due to a fall by Nao Kodaira, winner of the Olympic 500 m in Pyeongchang. Kodaira had in fact won the other three races she had participated in, and had also claimed the world record, lowering it to 1:12.09. Various other skaters had shown strong performances, including Vanessa Herzog, Jorien ter Mors, Marrit Leenstra and Miho Takagi.
Ter Mors was the first of these favorites to skate. She trailed former world record holder Brittany Bowe going into the final lap, but then produced a 28.50 lap - the fastest final lap of the field - to finish in 1:13.56 (Olympic and Track Record). Allrounder Takagi also had a fast final lap (28.74), but didn’t have the same sprint speed and came home in 1:13.98. Kodaira then viciously attacked the leading time, but lost her half-second advantage going into the final lap, with a final time of 1:13.82. In the final pair, both Leenstra and Bergsma were vitually beaten at 600 m, as neither of them was faster than Ter Mors there, and they placed outside of the medal ranks. It was Ter Mors’s third career gold medal after winning the 1,500 m and team pursuit in Sochi. Later in the Olympics, she would also win a bronze medal in the short-track relay, becoming the first female Winter Olympian to win medals in two sports at the same Games.

He was Norwegian Champion nine times in the period 1974-1984, and to the great satisfaction of his home crowd he won the 1982 World Championship in Oslo. Sandberg’s best Olympic placing was fourth in 1980, but he decided to go for a medal in the 1984 Olympics before ending his career. His closest rivals were expected to come from East Germany and Finland. East Germany had not been able to fill the gap after the great Ulrich  Wehling retired, and Konrad Winkler, World Champion from 1978, ended his career after winning silver in the 1982 World Championships behind Sandberg. Their best was expected to be Uwe Dotzauer, bronze medalist in 1982. Finland’s Rauno Miettinen, now aged 34 and competing in his fourth and last Olympics, had silver medals from the 1972 Olympics and from the 1978 World Championships as his best international championships performances. He also strongly hoped to end his career as Olympic champion. However, Jouko Karjalainen, the 1980 silver medalist, was considered as Finland’s best card. He was an excellent cross-country skier, and if he could do reasonably well in the jumping event, he could challenge for Olympic gold.
Sandberg started well in the ski jumping, winning the event ahead of the relatively unknown Soviet skier, Sergey Chervyakov, with West Germany’s Thomas  Müller in third place. Miettinen placed sixth and Karjalainen was still in position for a medal, placing 15th out of the 28 competitors. Dotzauer jumped to 12th place and was a disappointment.
In the cross-country event, Karjalainen started one minute behind Sandberg as next-to-last of the 28 competitors, and had to beat his Norwegan rival by approximately 2:15 to pass him in the final classification. At 9 km he passed Sandberg on the cross-country track, but during the last six kilometers Sandberg gave away only 20 more seconds. Karjalainen won the cross-country race by a comfortable margin, but Sandberg placed second and could celebrate as the Olympic Champion. Karjalainen was an easy silver medalist and another Finn, 21-year old Jukka Ylipulli, was a surprise bronze medal winner after placing fifth in both the jumping and cross-country event. Miettinen ended his career by placing fourth, and West Germany’s Müller, third in the jumping event, was fifth, far better than expected.  Soviet’s Chervyakov dropped from second after the ski jump to 12th, but his 19-year old teammate, Ukrainian Aleksandr Prosvirnin advanced from 13th to sixth place, the best Soviet placing in Nordic Combined in twenty years.
Sandberg ended his last season impressively, winning the Nordic Combined World Cup for the 1983/84 season and finally winning another World Championship gold medal as a member of the Norwegian team in the Nordic combined team event in Rovaniemi, Finland in March. The Nordic combined team event had been held for the first time at the 1982 World Championships in Oslo.

The Rio silver medalist Denis Ablyazin, also of the ROC, was ranked fifth in qualifying. Competition was extremely close, with 0.05 points separating the first three and less than one point between the first and seventh placed gymnasts.
The first to perform was Adem Asil of Turkey, and he did his medal chances a great deal of good with a first vault that scored 15.266 points, the only 15-point vault of the final. His second vault, however, was a disappointing 13.633 and he ended up in sixth place. Davtyan, starting fourth, put himself in the lead with a total score of 14.733. Korea’s Sin Jae-Hwan then overtook him with a second vault of 14.833, which gave him a total of 14.783. Ablyazin was the seventh man up and his second vault of 14.800 put him level with Sin. The last man to go was Carlos Edriel Yulo, who was hoping to become the Philippines first Olympic gymnastics medalist and needed to score 15 with his second vault. He only managed 14.866, however, for fourth place. Sin won the tie break by virtue of his best vault being 14.833 to Ablyazin’s 14.800.

In the opening round, however, it was the British crew of Garry Herbert and brothers Jonny and Greg Searle who posted an Olympic record time, a surprising feat considering that the trio had rowed together in this discipline less than a dozen times. The other heats were won by Italy and Poland, the latter of whom was represented by Piotr Basta, Tomasz Mruczkowski, and Bartosz Sroga, the most recent World runners-up. In the semi-finals, the Britons demonstrated that their opening performance was no fluke by improving upon their Olympic record, while the Italians took the other heat. In the final, the Italians pulled to the front immediately and took on a huge lead, which seemed to indicate that they had simply been saving their strength for the medal round. In the last 500 metres, however, the Britons, who had been in third, undertook a powerful drive and quickly overtook the Romanian crew that had been in second place.

It was the first medal for the 34-year-old Torres in his fourth, and probably last, Olympic appearance, whereas the 22-year-old Jorge was competing in his second Games.

But missing was the current world record holder, Karen Muir of South Africa, who could not compete because her nation was banned from the Olympics because of its policy of apartheid in sport (and elsewhere), and would remain banned until 1992. America’s Kaye Hall, second at the 1967 Pan Ams, was expected to contend and medal. In the semi-finals Tanner bested Hall and posted the fastest qualifier. In the final, Hall made the turn first in 30.9, with Tanner on her shoulder, and America’s Jane Swagerty in third. And that is how they would finish, as Tanner could not catch Hall, who won an upset gold medal.

She was almost 35-years-old in Tokyo but was still formidable and was a co-favorite with German Malaika Mihambo, the 2019 World Champion. Two other top challengers were Serbian Ivana Španović, who had two Diamond League wins in 2021, and the USA’s Tara Davis, the 2021 NCAA Champion from the University of Texas.
All the favorites qualified although Mihambo needed three attempts to get an automatic qualifier. Španović led qualifying with a second attempt of 7.00 metres.
As the fifth jumper in the final Mihambo took the lead in round one with a jump of 6.83 metres, but the next jumper, Nigerian Ese Brume, surpassed her with 6.97. In round three Reese equalled Brume’s 6.97 mark but took the lead with a better second effort – 6.81 to 6.67. Mihambo had recorded 6.95 in round two. Brume went ahead in round four with a better subsidiary mark, jumping 6.88, just past Reese’s fourth round attempt of 6.87, but Reese responded in round five with 6.95 to retake the lead based on best second attempt.
Mihambo, Brume, and Reese were the last three jumpers in round six, in that order, and Mihambo moved out to 7.00 metres to take the lead. Neither Brume nor Reese could improve on their earlier marks which left Mihambo with the gold medal, Reese the silver, and Brume the bronze.
Mihambo had completed a triumvirate of triumphs in the event, with gold at Tokyo, at the 2019 Worlds, and the 2018 European Championships. Reese repeated as silver medallist, giving her three medals in the events, in addition to her London gold. For Nigeria it was the third Olympic medal in the event, after Chioma Ajunwa’s gold in 1996 and Blessing Okagbare’s silver in 2008.
