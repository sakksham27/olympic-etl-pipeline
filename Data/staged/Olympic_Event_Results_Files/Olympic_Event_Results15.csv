As with all Alpine skiing events in Sochi the competition took place in the Rosa Khutor Alpine Center. The downhill part was not shortened but held on exactly the same piste as the downhill race two days later. The last three winters saw only seven World Cup Super Combined events organized with only three different winners: Tina Maze (3), Lindsey Vonn (2), and Maria Höfl-Riesch (2), with the Super Combined scheduled for Sochi in 2012 cancelled due to heavy snow. The reigning World champion from 2013 was Höfl-Riesch, while Anna Fenninger won in 2011 with Maze bringing home silver both times. This winter saw only one World Cup Super Combined, which was won by Marie-Michèle Gagnon in Austrian Zauchensee, but with a Super G instead of a downhill, which favors technical skiiers. As Vonn was unable to compete after tearing her right ACL twice in 2013 (the first time at the World Championships in Schladming), the only two big favorites left were Maze and Höfl-Riesch.
Skiing first in the downhill phase Italian Francesca Marsaglia set a time of 1:43.96 and held onto the lead until the seventh skier to start, Lotte Sejersted (NOR), produced a best time of 1:43.85. Lara Gut (SUI), arguably more of a downhill and Super G specialist, then produced a leading time of 1:43.15 to give herself a chance to medal. The only skier to better this time was Julia Mancuso (USA) who skied the course in 1:42.68. Defending champion, Maria Höfl-Riesch (GER), produced a time of 1:43.72 for fifth place and keep her chances of a medal open.
With the top 30 going in reverse order, Šárka Strachová (CZE) was to produce the fastest slalom run of 50.10 seconds, but a 25th place in the downhill section meant she finished ninth overall. Michaela Kirchgasser (AUT), more of a slalom specialist, produced the second quickest slalom for a combined time of 2:36.41, and led as several skiers came in behind her – eventually she would finish seventh. Ragnhild Mowinckel (NOR) and Dominique Gisin (SUI) briefly held the overall lead, until Austrian Nicole Hosp produced a fine run to give her an overall time of 2:35.02. She held onto the lead until Höfl-Riesch produced the third fastest slalom, to take the overall lead with 2:34.62. Gut tried to put in a performance, but was unable to finish the course, so leaving Mancuso the last of the medal contenders. Although only 13th fastest in the slalom, this was enough to give her a combined time of 2:35.15 for the bronze medal.
The first six finishers represented six different nations. As the day before in the men’s downhill, ski manufacturer Head won gold (Höfl-Riesch) and bronze (Mancuso), while Hosp earned silver with Fischer. Höfl-Riesch defended her title and followed in the footsteps of Janica Kostelić who won this event in 2002 and 2006. In total Höfl-Riesch became the sixth Alpine skier (and fourth women) to defend a gold medal.

The three clearly raced as a team, taking turns leading until the final two kilometers, when Johaug and Bjørgen pulled away from their teammate. Obviously the Norwegians left their waxing problems from the early days of Sochi far behind, sweeping the medals in an event no Nordic country had ever won. Approaching the last hill and then coming into the stadium, Johaug could not challenge Bjørgen’s lead in the sprint, finishing 2.6 sec behind the winner. Steira, a slightly surprising medal winner, came in on third place another 23.6 sec behind Johaug but well ahead of the fast finishing Kerttu Niskanen from Finland. One of the favorites, Poland’s Justyna Kowalczyk, the defending gold medalist, had to retire halfway through the race due to an injury after being hit by another skier.
In winning, Bjørgen equaled her gold medal count at Vancouver. Her sixth gold medal also equaled the Olympic Winter Games record of Soviet speed skater Lidiya Skoblikova and Russian cross-country skier Lyubov Yegorova. With her additional three silver medals and one bronze medal, Bjørgen became now the most successful woman in Olympic Winter Games history, although her 10 medals equalled the female Winter best by Stefania Belmondo (ITA-CCS) and Raisa Smetanina (URS-CCS).

But at the 1991 Pan-American Games, the USA was defeated by Brazil and Cuba.  The 1992 tournament appeared more wide open, with the break-up of the Soviet Union.  The USSR had won the 1989 European Championships, but at Barcelona, there was no Russian team, but a combined team representing many of the former Soviet Republics – the Unified Team (EUN).  In the tournament, the USA easily won Group B, going undefeated.  The Unified Team finished second in Group A, losing to Cuba.  The semi-finals saw the USA play the former Soviet team, and stunningly, the Unified Team won, 79-73.  The Unifieds then defeated China in the final to win the gold medal, with the United States defeating Cuba for the bronze medal.

In fact it was thought that the Americans could sweep the event, with Ginny Duenkel, already a bronze medalist in Tokyo in the 100 back, and Terri Lee Stickles. Ramenofsky led the final through 175 metres, when she was caught by Duenkel who gradually pulled away from her teammate. Duenkel held on to upset Ramenofsky and win the gold medal, with Stickles completing the American sweep by outlasting Australia’s Dawn Fraser. Duenkel posted 4:43.3, a personal best for her by 3/10ths of a second, but well off Ramenofsky’s world record of 4:39.5.

His performances in the early rounds did little to dent American enthusiasm and when France’s Laurent Boudouani upset Song Gyeong-Seop of Korea it appeared Gould would advance to the final comfortably when the two met in the semi-final. Boudouani had other ideas and, being the bigger man, bullied the more skillful American around the ring to take the decision.
Opposing the Frenchman in the final was Robert Wangila, the African champion from Kenya. Wangila was the complete antithesis of Gould - a powerful built fighter with a massive punch. After some initial sparring the Kenyan connected with Boudouani’s jaw on the two minute mark and sent him sprawling to the canvas. The Frenchman saw out the round and another big punch knocked him down again in round two and the referee stepped in to save further punishment. As of 2012 Wangila remains the only Kenyan to have won an Olympic title outside track & field athletics.
Both finalists launched professional careers albeit with very different outcomes. Wangila based himself in Las Vegas and had won 22 of his 26 bouts when he faced David Gonzales in July 1994. After being stopped in the seventh round of a brutal fight he collapsed in his dressing room and slipped into a coma. He never regained consciousness and died three days later. His body was returned but an argument between his wife and parents over whether he had converted from Christianity to Islam delayed his funeral until a court rendered its’ verdict. Two years after Wangila’s death Boudouani began a reign as the WBA light middleweight champion.

Liam Heath and Jon Schofield of Great Britain, who had the home town advantage and the last three European Championship titles, could not be counted out either.
By posting the fastest times in the heats and semi-finals, however, and at a relatively comfortable distance away from the rest of the field, the Russian duo of Aleksandr Dyachenko and Yury Postrigay quickly established themselves as the teams to beat for Olympic gold. Postrigay was a rookie, although he came fourth with a different partner in the event at the 2010 World Championships, whereas Dyachenko had World Championship medals across three different events from 2009, 2010, and 2011. In the final the Russians were even more dominant, winning the race an impressive three-quarter lengths ahead of the second place Belarusians; there was not a single opportunity for anyone else to pull ahead. Heath and Schofield had to settle for bronze, while Hybois and Jouve were left out of the medals entirely with a fourth place finish. The Russians’ margin of victory in the event, the largest of the four new canoe sprints at over seven-tenths of a second, was a fitting close to the exciting Olympic canoeing program at the 2012 Games.

Dimas’ gold medal was the first individual one by an American man since Dallas Bixler had won the same event in 1932. Behind Dimas, Unified Team member Hryhoriy Misiutin and German Andreas Wecker tied for the silver medal.

Competitors losing to the finalists entered repechage tournament for bronze medals.,na,"Russia’s Buvaysar Saytiyev had won the gold medal in this class in 1996 and 2004, and was a six-time World and six-time European Champion. His star had dimmed a bit, however, and he was not chosen for the 2007 World Championships, which were won by Makhach Murtazaliyev. Saytiyev and Murtazaliyev wrestled off for the spot at Beijing, won by Saytiyev. Saytiyev made it to the finals in Beijing, where he faced Uzbeki Soslan Tigiyev. Tigiyev won the first period but Saytiyev dramatically recovered to win the last two periods and the gold medal. At London in 2012 Tigiyev appeared to add a bronze medal to his Beijing silver, but he would be disqualified for a doping positive for methylhexaneamine. Saytiyev’s gold medal in Beijing made him the only Olympic wrestler to win three gold medals in the same class, but not consecutively.
That was how the event and the results seemed to have ended. In 2015, however, the IOC began re-testing samples from the 2008 Beijing and 2012 London Olympics, using newer, more advanced testing techniques, in an effort to find those who had used performance enhancing drugs (PEDs), but in whom it could not be detected at the time of those Olympics. This was one of the many events affected.
In October 2016, Soslan Tigiyev (UZB) was revealed to have a positive test for turinabol (dehydrochloromethyltestosterone), and was disqualified, losing his bronze medal. Belarussian Murad Gaydarov was upgraded to a silver medal while Romanian Ștefan Gheorghiță received the bronze medal. Tigiyev’s brother, Taymuraz Tigiyev, who competed for Kazakhstan, had also originally won a silver medal in 96 kg freestyle, but was also disqualified in October 2016 for turinabol. Soslan Tigiyev would later originally win a bronze medal in this class at London in 2012, but in November 2012, that was also removed when he also tested positive for turinabol.

The round three match, in which Yumin defeated Brüchert on points, proved to be decisive and gave the gold medal to Yumin, with Brüchert taking silver, and Arai bronze. For all three medalists, this was their only Olympic appearance. Dukov, who placed fourth, would later win a silver medal in 1980 at Moskva as a featherweight. Yumin won World titles as a featherweight in 1977-79 but failed to make the Soviet team for Moskva.

Stepanov was winning his fight against Ireland’s Freddie Gilroy, despite having been warned by the referee for fouling his opponent, when he turned his head to stare at the referee and was knocked out.
From the quarter-finals the draw neatly split into a section of European boxers and a section from the rest of the world. Gilroy’s progress was checked at the semi-final stage by Wolfgang Behrendt of Germany who had only recently moved up in weight from flyweight whilst Song Sun-Cheon became the first Korean Olympic boxing finalist when he dispatched Claudio Barrientos of Chile in the other semi-final. By defeating Song, Behrendt became the first boxer from the GDR to win an Olympic title although it should be pointed out that East and West competed in a combined German team in 1956.
Éder Jofre of Brazil lost in the quarter finals in Melbourne but went on to a glittering career as a professional and is acknowledged as one of the greatest fighters of all time. He reigned as world bantamweight champion for five years then returned after a four year retirement to win the featherweight world crown. Jofre retired with a record of 72 wins, 2 losses and 4 draws in his 78 fight career.

18000320,"Combined, Men",2020 Summer Olympics,61,Sport Climbing,/editions/61/sports/CLB,3 –  5 August 2021,"Aomi Urban Sports Park, Koto, Tokyo",20 from 15 countries,na,na,"The first ever sport climbing event held at the Olympics started in the late afternoon of 3 August 2021. The field contained the reigning 2019 world champion in combined, Tomoa Narasaki, as well as the silver and bronze medallists Jakob Schubert, and Rishat Khaibullin. Schubert was also the 2018 world champion, with Sean McColl winning the World Championships in 2012, 2014, and 2016. All combined world champions in the history of this sport participated in Tokyo. They were Adam Ondra (2009-10, and 2015), Schubert (2011-13 and 2018), McColl (2014 and 2016), and Narasaki (2017 and 2019). Additionally, all combined World Cup winners from the last eleven editions were present in Tokyo, as were all European champions in the sport’s history: Schubert (2015), Jan Hojer (2017), and Aleksey Rubtsov (2020). As a result, the competition was wide open with no clear favorite.
The qualification started with the speed element, but without the reigning world record holder Veddriq Leonardo (INA), who managed to climb the standard wall in 5.20 seconds in May 2021 but did not qualify for the Olympics. The fastest after two rounds was Bassa Mawem with Narasaki second, and Bassa’s brother Mickaël Mawem third. The reigning speed world champion Ludovico Fossali only finished 13th.
The second element was bouldering, where Mickaël Mawem was the only climber to reach three of the four tops to place first. He was followed by Narasaki, the reigning 2019 World champion in bouldering, and Ondra, while Bassa Mawem finished 18th. After the first two events, Mickaël Mawem led the qualification with three points followed by Narasaki with five points and Bassa Mawem on 18.
The last qualification event, the lead, was won by Schuber, followed by Colin Duffy, Alberto Ginés, and the reigning 2019 world champion in lead, Ondra. The qualification was won by Mickaël Mawem, on his birthday, with 33 points (3x1x11), with Narasaki second with 56 points (2x2x14). The top eight qualified for the final, and with a good performance in lead (fifth place), Nathaniel Coleman jumped from 13th place after two events to eighth to secure the last spot in the final. Bassa Mawem qualified in seventh, but he ruptured his bicep tendon and was unable to participate in the final.
As the regulations did not provide for a substitute athlete, the final was held with seven athletes two days after qualification, and this had an influence on the opening speed part of the final. Unlike in the qualification, the speed element in the final operated on a knockout system. Bassa Mawem had won the speed in qualification, and Ondra was the lowest placed finallist in the speed qualification (18th) and consequently they were paired together. This caused controversy, however, because Ondra received a walk-over and would be placed at least fourth in what was his weakest discipline.
The winner of the speed was Ginés, who won his quarter-final against Duffy after his opponent produced a false start, and then beat Ondra in the semi-final. In the final, Narasaki slipped away as he tried to skip the third hold, a move he did not create but, due to him making it popular, it became known as the “Tomoa skip”. Because of his slip, however, there were calls jokingly, to rename it the “Tomoa slip”. Narasaki had the weakest performance of all finallists, with a time of 7.82, as he gave the win to Ginés, while Coleman and Schubert, as expected, placed sixth and seventh, respectively, but their preferred elements were still to come.
Coleman won the bouldering as the only climber to reach two tops. He was followed by Mickaël Mawem and Narasaki, while Ginés finished seventh as the only athlete not to manage to reach any top. This saw the field close together after two events with Coleman, Mickaël Mawem, and Narasaki all having six points followed by Ginés with seven points, Duffy (20), Ondra (24), and Schubert in last place with 35 points.
The starting order for the lead was not according to these standings but according to the results in the lead in the qualification, which meant that Narasaki had to start first and Schubert last, but this had no influence on the competition as the athletes were not allowed to watch their opponents or to receive any outside advice. The third starter in the lead final was Coleman, who went into the lead only to be overtaken by the next starter, Ondra. Next up was Ginés who placed between them in second place, and he in turn was overtaken by the penultimate starter Duffy. With these standings, Ginés was in the lead with 21 points followed by Coleman and Ondra with 24 each, and Narasaki and Duffy both with 30. This meant that the last starter Schubert could go for bronze if he could win the final element, while every other result would give him seventh place overall only. On the other hand, if Schubert finished second or third between Ginés and Ondra, gold would go to Ondra. At the end, Schubert was the only finallist to reach the top of the route and clearly finished first overall to give himself bronze with Ginés taking gold and the silver being won by Coleman, who only got into the final as the eighth and last qualifier.

There were no heats, as the thirteen runners started together, with twelve men on the line, and one, unknown soul forced to start behind the front line.  Herman Groman went into the lead at 70 metres, and quickly opened a gap.  The field immediately sorted itself out into two groups.  At 200 metres Hillman, who had been running third, took the lead, while Joseph Fleming left the second pack and joined the main group.  Into the last turn, George Poage tried to pass but was cut off by Fleming and Frank  Waller.  The final sprint involved Hillman, Waller, Groman, Fleming and Meyer Prinstein, as Poage fell back.  Hillman powered ahead to win by about three yards over Waller, with Groman on Waller’s heels and Fleming and Prinstein finishing almost together, another two yards back.
Though Percival Molson failed to place, he would achieve his fame later, but it would cost him his life.  Molson, the great-grandson of John Molson, founder of Molson Breweries of Canada, attended McGill, from which he graduated in 1900, after serving as president of his senior class and gaining every athletic honor the university could offer.  When World War I broke out, he joined the Princess Patricia’s Canadian Light Infantry, and fought for them at the Battle of Mount Sorrel in 1916.  He was wounded during the battle and returned home, receiving the Military Cross for his efforts.  He insisted he be allowed to rejoin the company and on 5 July 1917, while fighting on the outskirts of Avion, France, he was hit by mortar fire while attempting to rescue a fallen friend.  Both were killed.  In his honor, the main athletic stadium at McGill University is known as the Percival Molson Memorial Stadium.

The delayed competition was planned to be completed in a single day, but the competitors protested and the third and fourth runs were held on the 15th. The first three runs were all won by Fiske’s crew, creating a four second gap for the final run. The Red Devils took back some time in the final descent, but not enough to keep Fiske from his second consecutive title. Eagan’s performance, a gold medal in both the Summer and Winter Olympics, has not yet been equalled by any Olympian. Fiske overcame a natural advantage held by Homburger, whose construction firm, Smith, Golder, & Homburger of Saranac Lake, had been enlisted by Stanislaus Zentzytzki, and Homburger consulted on the final design of the run, although it was eventually built by the firm of Leo A. Malone of Lake Placid.

The 2001 World Cup champion was Croatian Janica Kostelić, who had overcome significant knee problems to get to that level. During a training run in December 1999, she had sustained a multi-ligament knee injury and the resultant surgery kept her out until the 2000 season. After winning the World Cup, she had undergone a series of knee surgeries in the summer of 2001, and was still recovering as she came into Salt Lake City. Better in the slalom than the downhill, the weather delay helped her as she was able to take the lead by placing first in the slalom, ahead of Martina Ertl, the 2001 World Champion. The downhill was won by Austrian Renate Götschl, who had been fourth in the slalom. It moved her up to second place, but Kostelić placed third in the downhill, to hold onto her lead and take the gold medal. It was her first ever Olympic gold medal, but during the 2002 Winter Olympics, she would win three golds and four medals. Her four Alpine gold medals at one Olympics was a record for any alpine skier of either gender.

The Barcelona course was point-to-point, starting in Mataró, northeast of Barcelona, and finishing in the Olympic Stadium. The route followed the seacoast for the early part of the race. But the finish was brutal, ascending Montjuic, a small mountain in Barcelona where the Olympic Stadium was located. The rise was about 150 metres (480 feet), and came at the end of 42+ kilometers (26+ miles) of running.
The race started at 6:30 PM, but it was a bright, sunny day, with temperatures approaching 27° C. (80° F.). Because of the heat the pace was slow and the pack stayed together, with 30 runners still leading thru 20 km. The defending champion, Gelindo Bordin, was in that group, but dropped out shortly thereafter with a groin strain. By 30 km. the race had come down to a group of five – Kim Wan-Gi and Hwang Yeong-Jo, both of Korea, Koichi Morishita and Takeyuki Nakayama of Japan, and Germany’s Stephan Freigang. This group would constitute the top four places, with Kim Wang-Gi dropping back eventually and finishing 28th. By 35 km. Hwang and Morishita had separated themselves and together to the base of Montjuic. Up the mountain, Hwang slowly pulled ahead and entered the stadium in the lead. He held on to win the gold medal, Morishita in second, 22 seconds back, and Freigang earning a bronze medal. The winning time, 2-13:23, was the slowest since 1968, and on a sea-level course, since Abebe Bikila’s win in Roma in 1960.
The men’s marathon finished just before the start of the Closing Ceremony. Because of the late start for the race, any runners finishing after 2-45, or at about 9:15 PM, could not finish in the main stadium, and the final runners to finish the race were re-directed to an alternate finish line on the warm-up track outside the Olympic Stadium.

The sixteen events contested in the “Championnat International de Gymnastique” were as follows: 1) Horizontal Bar – Compulsory; 2) Horizontal Bar – Optional; 3) Parallel Bars – Compulsory; 4) Parallel Bars – Optional; 5) Rings – Compulsory; 6) Rings – Optional; 7) Pommelled Horse – Compulsory; 8) Pommelled Horse – Optional; 9) Floor exercises – Compulsory; 10) Floor exercises – Optional; 11) Long horse vault – Compulsory; 12) “Combined” high jump – Compulsory; 13) Long jump – Compulsory; 14) Pole vault – Compulsory; 15) Rope climbing – Compulsory; and 16) Weight lifting 50 kg. 10 times – Compulsory.
Scoring for the first ten events was from 0-20, depending on the quality of the exercises, as follows, per the 1900 Official Report: 20 – Perfect; 18-19 – Very good; 15-17 – Good; 12-14 – Fairly good; 9-11 – Acceptable; 6-8 – Mediocre; 3-5 – Poor; 1-2 – Very Poor; 0 – No try made.
In the athletics events, which were commonly held at the turn of the century in combined events in gymnastics, the athletes were apparently scored for “style” points while attempting to perform at a certain standard.  In the long jump, the standard was to jump 5.00 metres.  In the pole vault, the standard was to vault 2.20 metres.  In the combined high and long jump, they were required to jump over a rope held at a height of 1.25 metres and set at 1.00 metre from the take-off.  In rope climbing, the gymnasts were asked to climb a 6.00 metre tall rope.  In the 20th event, or the weightlifting, the gymnasts were given 2 points for each time that they could lift the 50 kg. overhead to arms height, to a maximum of 10 times, or 20 points.
Le Gymnaste and the 1900 Official Report made several comments about the nationality of the gymnasts.  They stated that no Russians had entered but 12 or 14 Germans would be present.  They also noted that only a few Swiss would compete, because the Swiss championships were to be held the next week, preventing many of them from traveling to Paris for the contests.  Of note, Joseph Martinez, who finished 7th in the Olympic event, eventually also finished 3rd at the Swiss championships.  Also mentioned was that only one Italian competed, that being Camillo Pavanello from Sampierdarena.  Interestingly, Le Gymnaste commented that four (4) Algerians were competing, all from Oran, and none from Algiers.  Algeria was a French colony until 1962, but these four athletes – Jean Martinez, Jean Castiglioni, Lévy, and Koubi – could be considered the first African Olympians.
The events were held outdoors and it was very hot, with temperatures between 35° and 40° C. (95°-104° F.).  The event was closed by a dinner for all contestants held on 31 July at The Restaurant de la Lune à l’Exposition.

Lindstrom broke Myyrä’s world record with 66.62 (218-7) in October 1924.

The last non-Korean World Champion was Simon Fairweather of Australia, who was champion back in 1991.

Fairweather qualified eighth in Sydney in the ranking round, which was led by three Koreans, Jang Yong-Ho qualifying first. Because of the rapid turnover on the Korean team, none of the Koreans were among their recent World Champions, although second-placed O Gyo-Mun had been an individual bronze medalist in Atlanta. But Jang went out in round three while the other two Koreans lost in the quarter-finals. Fairweather advanced to the final, his only close match in the semis against Dutch archer Wietse van Alten, which he won 112-110. Fairweather won his gold medal by defeating upstart American Vic Wunderle in the final, 113-106.

Špotáková answered with 69.22 (227-11), also a PR and national record, but settled into second place and they held those positions thru the first three rounds. In round four Abakumova hammered the spear out to 70.78 (232-3), making her the second-longest performer in history. But Špotáková came thru in the final round with 71.42 (234-4), less than a foot short of the world record, held by Cuba’s Osleidys Menéndez, who placed fifth with only one valid throw. The bronze medal went to Germany’s Christina Obergföll, silver medalist at the 2007 Worlds, who had opened with 66.13 (216-11) but then struggled with four fouls.
That was how the event and the results seemed to have ended. In 2015, however, the IOC began re-testing samples from the 2008 Beijing and 2012 London Olympics, using newer, more advanced testing techniques, in an effort to find those who had used performance enhancing drugs (PEDs), but in whom it could not be detected at the time of those Olympics. This was one of the many events affected.
In September 2016 Mariya Abakumova (RUS) had a positive re-test for turinabol (dehydrochloromethyltestosterone) and was tentatively disqualified. However, she appealed this to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS), but the appeal was rejected by the CAS in July 2018.

The leader in that event starts off, and then every skier after him would start behind by the time margin from the sprint. Only the top 60 finishers from the sprint were eligible to start, but in reality, many of the lower finishers would elect not to start this race. For the men, only 57 eventually started in Salt Lake City. The pursuit had been contested at the World Championships since 1997.
The favorite was Ole Einar Bjørndalen, who had already won the 20 km and 10 km sprint in Salt Lake City, and thus started with a 29-second lead. Also to be considered was France’s Raphaël Poirée, who had won the seasonal World Cup in 1999-2000 and 2000-01, and would win again in 2002, but he had finished a disappointing ninth in the sprint, and would start 1:06 behind Bjørndalen. Sven Fischer had been second in the sprint and started only 29 seconds behind. In the end it was a fairly easy victory for Bjørndalen, who was not seriously challenged in winning his third gold medal in Salt Lake City. Fischer shot poorly in this section, missed four targets, and dropped back to 12th place. Poirée came on very strong and gained 23 seconds on Bjørndalen to move up to the silver medal position. The deciding move came at the final shooting range, when Poirée missed only once, and German Ricco Groß missed twice.

Meanwhile at London 2012 at Hadleigh Farms, the course was enjoyed by the riders and was very spectator friendly (rated at 60% visibility). The South African course designer for the Rio 2016 Olympic Games mountain bike course, Nick Floros, created a technically challenging course for the riders, yet one that allowed the spectators to enjoy the competition as much as possible, with an 85% visibility, all while making use of the natural landscape at the Deodoro venue.
The Mountain Bike Centre in Rio was one of three venues that comprised the X-Park (along with canoe slalom and BMX), and was built with legacy in mind, remaining open to the public following the Olympics. The mountain bike course consisted of grassy wide-open stretches combined with man-made obstacles and serious slopes - a marked difference from the more level terrain four years before in London 2012.
The mountain bike races were mass start events on 20 (women) and 21 (men) August 2016. Riders were seeded into a starting grid according to their current Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI) ranking. The riders completed one 0.57 km start loop, followed by six laps of the course for women (29.67 km) and seven laps for the men (34.52 km), where each lap was 4.85 km long. The total number of laps to be raced was announced at the team managers’ meeting on the day before the first race with the aim to ensure that the winning time was within the set parameters.
With the same rules and competition format, the only differences between the World Championships and the Olympic Games is that there are more competitors in the field at World Championships, due to different quotas for each National Olympic Committee (NOC): at the Olympic Games there are a maximum of three men and two women per NOC. There were no rule and competition format changes since the 2012 Olympic Games in London.
The men’s mountain bike race at the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio started at 12:30 pm on 21 August 2016 and consisted of 49 riders from 32 nations. It was 23 degrees Celsius. As aforementioned, the race configuration consisted of one start loop of 0.57 km plus seven laps of the course for a total of 34.52 km. 2015 World road champion, Slovakia’s Peter Sagan put in a notable opening lap, moving from the back of the field into the lead group by the end of the first lap, but a flat tire at the beginning of the second lap ended his Olympic medal dream. It was then Switzerland’s Nino Schurter who took the early lead with Spaniard Carlos Coloma, but defending Olympic champion Jaroslav Kulhavý of Czech Republic soon joined them as Coloma lost pace. The two-time Olympic champion (and five-time World champion), France’s Julien Absalon faded to two minutes back as the leaders set a scorching pace.
Starting the fifth of the seven lap race, Schurter and Kulhavý had 30 seconds lead on the two-man chase of Coloma and Maxime Marotte of France, while Switzerland’s Mathias Fluckiger was chasing in fifth, more than a minute behind. The lead duo held an initial gap of more than 30 seconds over the first group behind them, who by this time appeared to be racing for bronze.
Schurter dropped Kulhavý as they approached a technical rock section, opening a gap that he would hold until the finish. The Swiss rider started the final lap with a 33-second gap over Kulhavý, while Marotte and Coloma were 1:19 behind. Schurter continued to open his gap over the final lap, holding a 44-second lead on Kulhavý with half a lap to go until the finish, and 1:50 over Coloma and Marotte.
Schurter won the gold 50 seconds ahead of Kulhavý, who won the silver. It was Coloma in for the bronze medal, 10 seconds ahead of Marotte in fourth. The two-time Olympic champion Absalon finished eighth. The medals were presented by Denis Oswald, IOC member (Switzerland) and Brian Cookson, President of the UCI Management Committee.

Schmid was the clear leader in the last race, and Matt was not far behind him. Del Bosco and Grønvold battled it out for the bronze throughout the race, with the former gaining the edge shortly before the end of the course.

The pack reeled them in on the fourth lap, but the three Japanese still led through nine laps. The pace was steady and the field was together for 4,000 metres. At 5,000 metres Kenyan Sally Jepkosgei Kipyego went to the lead and increased the pace. When she pushed the sixth kilometre in 3:00.02 the field spread out, with only Dibaba, her two Ethiopian teammates, Kipyego, Cheruiyot, and Bahrain’s Shitaye Eshete in the lead group. At 8,000 metres the group was four, with Werknesh Kidane (ETH), Kipyego, Cheruiyot, and Dibaba left to contest the medals. Dibaba bided her time but with 600 metres left went to the front, and surged ahead, pulling away to defend her gold medal with almost a six-second margin. Kipyego was the only one who tried to go with her, and she would win the silver, four seconds ahead of Cheruiyot’s bronze placement.
The victory made Dibaba the first woman to defend the 10K gold medal, although her cousin, Derartu Tulu, had won the event in 1992 and 2000. One week later, Dibaba would attempt to repeat the 5/10K double, but could finish only third in the 5K. In that race, Cheruiyot would win another medal with a silver. The pace was fast enough in this race that Dibaba’s 30:20.75 was the fastest time of the year and 13 of the top 14 would record either a PR or a yearly best, with Eshete setting a national record.

Grotheer agreed that China was an up-and-coming force in skeleton, with the women also having posted creditable results after two runs. Zhao Dan was fourth going into Heat 3. Germany, which was so strong in the sliding sports of bobsleigh and luge, finally won its first medal in men’s skeleton when
Christopher Grotheer and Axel Jungk finished 1-2 for gold and silver.

However, to prevent individual nations from dominating with over-representation, no more than three gymnasts from any one country could advance to the individual final. The total score consisted of 50% of the team all-around score and the performances on all four apparatuses in the individual final. The defending champion was Soviet Lyudmila Turishcheva who had also won the 1974 World Championships. She had been challenged since the 1972 Olympics by her countrywoman, Olga Korbut, who was always the crowd favorite, but could never defeat Turishcheva. There were two other challengers for the title, the new young Soviet Nelli Kim, and a 14-year-old Romanian, Nadia Comăneci, who had upset Turishcheva at the 1975 European Championships. Comăneci had won other significant meets recently, the 1975 pre-Olympic tune-up in Montréal and the America’s Cup in March 1976.
Comăneci took the new paradigm of women’s gymnastics, started by Korbut at the 1972 Olympics, and extended it, adding new dangerous acrobatic moves that often shocked the crowds. She received perfects 10s during the team competition for her performance on the balance beam and uneven bars. They had not been expected, so the scoreboards in the Montréal Forum had not been designed for this, and they were displayed to the spectators as 1.00. She would eventually earn seven scores of 10.0 in Montréal, and Kim would receive two. Comăneci took a big lead after the team all-around and then kept extending it on every apparatus, winning the gold medal by 0.60 points over Nelli Kim, a huge margin in modern gymnastics. Turishcheva added a bronze medal to her gold from 1972, while Korbut placed fifth. Comăneci would continue to dominate gymnastics in the coming years, with Kim her biggest rival, until she won only a controversial silver medal at the 1980 Olympics, when the judging seemed to favor the hometown Soviets.
Finishing in 37th place in Montréal was Soviet Elvira Saadi, who had actually placed seventh in the team qualifying, but could not compete in the final because she was the fourth-placed Soviet. This new system allowed the Netherlands’ Monique Bolleboom to advance to the individual all-around final, although she had been only 62nd of the original 86 gymnasts.

Mexico champion Mohammad Nassiri had also won the world title in 1969 and 1970. The 1971 title had been claimed by Gennady Chetin, fourth at the previous Olympics. Imre Földi, who’d missed the 1968 gold on bodyweight only, had been victorious at the 1970 and 1971 European Championshps. The defending bronze medallist, Henryk Trębicki, had not won any titles since Mexico, but had been a regular podium visitor.
In the press, both Földi and Nassiri tied the Olympic Record, making 127.5 kg in their third lifts. In the snatch, Nassiri fell behind, failing twice at 105.0 kg, while Földi raised 107.5 (as well as Chetin and Trębicki). The snatch was won by Japan’s Koji Miki, whose competition lift was 112.5 kg. But in an out-of-competition attempt to break the world record, he improved his own mark from 113.5 kg to 114.0 kg. While Miki played no role in the overall classification, Földi enjoyed a 5 kg lead over Trębicki, with Nassiri and Chetin tied for third. In his first clean & jerk, Nassiri cleared 142.5 kg, 5 kg better than Földi. He next set out to raise 152.5 kg, which would give him the lead. But both his remaining lifts were faulty, while Földi assured his victory by improving to 142.5 as well, making for an overall world record total of 377.5 kg. Meanwhile, Chetin passed Trębicki for the bronze medal.
The lifter placing 12th, Soviet-born Israeli Ze’ev Friedman, would become one of the victims of the kidnapping by the Palestinian Black September group. Friedman was killed in the firefight at Fürstenfeldbruck Air Base, in a failed attempt to rescue the hostages.

At the World Cup in Hamar, in December 1993, he had improved his own world record to 35.92, becoming the first man to go below 36 seconds. He nearly copied that race the next day, skating 35.96. In addition to a few more World Cup wins, he had won both 500 ms at the World Sprint Championships just weeks before the Olympics, winning the overall title as well. His previous rival, 1988 and 1992 champion Uwe-Jens Mey had retired, but he did face strong opposition from Japan and Russia. Of these, Sergey Klevchenya and Yasunori Miyabe had also won World Cup races, with the Russian finishing second at the World Sprint Championships.
With all favourites skating early in the program, Jansen was drawn in the inner lane of the second pair. This meant he had the final outer curve, considered an advantage. Still, he was unable to keep his speed, Jansen needed to correct and briefly touched the ice. He finished in 36.66, already the second time behind Liu Hongbo, and his Olympic dreams seemed over. This left chances for the others. Manabu Horii narrowly beat Liu’s leading time with 36.53. Then Klevchenya took the ice. He eliminated co-favorite Miyabe in a direct confrontation, also lowering the Olympic Record to 36.39. The only outsider left then was Klevchenya’s compatriot, Aleksandr Golubev. Known for his quick starts, he departed in 9.58, the best opener of the field. Unlike his races at the World Sprints, Golubev held on the pace and crossed the line a bit sooner than Klevchenya (36.33). The 1-2 by Golubev and Klevchenya meant the first Olympic speed skating medals won by Russia as a separate nation.

Don Dickison and Todd Hallett of Canada were the most recent victors in the Double Sculls Challenge Cup at the Henley Royal Regatta. The opening heats were won by Zwolle and Rienks, the Austrian duo of Arnold Jonke and Christoph Zerbst, who had won the 1990 World Championships, Germans Peter Uhrig and Christian Händle, and Australians Steve Hawkins and Peter Antonie, who posted the fastest time in the round. In the semi-finals, the Austrians recorded the quickest run, beating the Dutch duo by over half a second, the Australians captured the other heat, and both the Canadians and the Germans were eliminated. The final was a hard-fought affair between the Austrians and the Australians, but the latter pulled away near the end and captured the gold medal, leaving the former to settle for silver. The defending champions finished much later, but remained on the podium by taking bronze. It was Australia’s first victory in Olympic rowing since Merv Wood had won the single sculls in 1948 and, as for Austria, it was the nation’s first Olympic rowing medal of any color since Alfred Sageder and Josef Kloimstein had taken silver in the 1960 coxless pairs event and remains, as of 2012, its most recent one.

In the opening round, Vili struck first with 20.56 (67-5½), a new PR for her. And that would win the gold medal. Mikhnevich answered in round two with her best mark, 20.28 (66-6½), but that was only good for the silver. Ostapchuk struggled early and barely qualified for the final three throws. In round five, she got off 19.86 (65-2), good for the bronze medal.

He was also the 2009 and 2011 World Champion in the horizontal bar, but would not go unchallenged in his quest for a sixth Olympic gold medal. His compatriot Zhang Chenglong, World Champion in 2010, was also competing, as was Emin Garibov of Russia, the reigning European Champion, and Epke Zonderland of the Netherlands, the 2011 European Champion and world runner-up in 2009 and 2010. Zonderland had also appeared in the finals of the 2008 Olympics, the first Dutch man to appear at the Games since 1928.
In the qualification round, Zonderland came out on top, with Zhang close behind and Danell Leyva of the United States, the 2011 World Champion in parallel bars and the bronze medalist in the London Olympic individual all-around, in third. Garbov and Zou finished further down, in sixth and seventh respectively, but still survived to the finals. In the finals Zou went fourth with the highest difficulty routine of the event, 7.900.

Fabian Hambüchen of Germany, 2007 World Champion, three time European Champion (2005, 2007, 2008), and bronze medalist at the 2008 Olympic Games, managed to pass Zou’s point total with a less difficult routine, but a much better execution score, the highest of the night. He did not stay long on the top of the podium, however, as Zonderland went next with an outstanding performance that ranked as difficult as Zou’s, but with better execution. Zonderland’s routine included three successive difficult flight elements, Cassica-Kovacs-Kolman, and he became the first person to successfully perform them, having attempted (and failed) at the 2012 European Championships. The final two gymnasts had no answer for this and Zonderland became the Netherlands’ first Olympic champion in gymnastics since the women’s all-around team in 1928, the only other time the nation had medalled in the sport. Hambüchen took home silver and Zou, after being crowned Olympic champion five times, settled for bronze.

After three relatively easy victories McTaggart found himself facing European champion, Harry Kurschat of Germany, in the Olympic final. Kurschat was perhaps a little lucky to have progressed from the semi-final by winning an unpopular split decision victory over Ireland’s Tony Byrne but his luck ran out against McTaggart and it was the Briton who had his hand raised in victory at the end of the three rounds.
McTaggart’s performance earned him the Val Barker Trophy as the most stylish boxer of the Games and a hero’s welcome in his hometown of Dundee. An eye defect robbed him of the opportunity to turn professional and he would twice return to the Olympic arena, winning bronze in 1960 and going out early in 1964. One notable boxer to miss these Games was Darweesh Mustafa Nassim who had won a silver medal for Egypt at the 1955 European Championships. The Suez crisis made his participation impossible.

Her winning time in 2002 was also the world record, and she had additionally won the 2003 World Championships. Clara Hughes was a former cyclist, having medaled in the 1996 Olympics. Returning to her first sport, speed skating, she won a third Olympic bronze in that sport in 2002. An expert in the longest distance on the women’s programme, Hughes had won the World Championships in 2004.
Two other medal contenders were not skating in Torino. 2002 runner-up Gretha Smit had made the Dutch team, but could not race as Dutch performances in the Olympic 3000 m meant that only two Dutch skaters could race. Polish skater Katarzyna Wójcicka later revealed she had been offered more than €40,000 to forfeit her place in the race in favor of Smit, although this was later denied by both Smit and her coach Ingrid Paul. The reigning World Champion, Anni Friesinger of Germany, was also missing from the starting list, citing exhaustion after four Olympic races.
The race followed the draw closely, with the best times coming from the last two pairs. The Czech flagbearer, junior skater Martina Sáblíková had hoped to win her country’s first ever Olympic speed skating medal in her favorite event. She was pegged against Cindy Klassen, who had already won four medals during the Games, including a gold medal in the 1500 m. As expected, Klassen started very fast, leaving Sáblíková far behind. The fast pace left Klassen exploding in the final laps, seeing her 5-second lead decrease rapidly in the last two laps. In the end, she managed to stay less than a second ahead of Sáblíková.
The final pair was one of the more exciting races of the Olympics. Pechstein sprinted away from known slow-starter Hughes. As both trailed Klassen’s fast split times, Hughes gradually picked up. At 4 km, Pechstein appeared to make a decisive move, but Hughes countered and first led the race at 4,600 m, albeit only by 0.15 seconds. With both skaters still two seconds behind Klassen’s time, Hughes outsprinted Pechstein for the gold, with the German finishing fast enough to also beat Klassen for the silver.

In the opening round, Yugoslavia had the fastest time, but it was obvious to most observers that the United States remained dominant.
In a rare occurrence during the round one repêchage, Canada and Sweden finished so closely that the photo-finish could not distinguish between them, and thus the jury allowed both crews to advance. The United States and Great Britain won the semi-finals, while Australia, the Soviet Union, and Germany rounded out the final following the repêchage.

At the major invitational, in Götzis, Austria, Clay won in 2006, ending the streak of Šebrle, who had won from 2001-2005. But going into Beijing Clay was favored, partly because Šebrle was at less than his best from injuries, and partly because he had been outstanding at the US Olympic Trials, which he won easily.

Wielema and Harrison, swimming in lanes four and five respectively were level as they approached the wall but Harrison’s finish was better and the decision of the judges was to award the gold to the South African.  It was a desperately close finish and not all of the officials were in agreement. Wielema herself believed she a quick glance to see where her rival was may have cost the vital fraction of a second needed for her to win. Dutch disappointment was compounded when Jean Stewart  of New Zealand beat Joke de Korte  to the bronze in another extremely close finish and also when Ria van der Horst  was disqualified by making an illegal turn. Harrison won four medals at the 1954 Commonwealth Games before retiring at the age of just seventeen while Wielema was both European champion and Dutch Sportsperson of the year for the year 1954.

The pre-Olympic favorite was likely Britain’s William  Applegarth, who had won the AAA earlier in 1912.  But the world record for 220 yards on a straight had been set at 21 1/5 by Ralph  Craig at the 1910 IC4A Championships, and he won the eastern U.S. Olympic trials.  After winning the 100 metres three days earlier at Stockholm, Craig was favored.
The six semi-finals advanced the winner of each heat to the final, with Applegarth and Germany’s Richard Rau joining four Americans, including Craig, to compete for the gold medal.  In the final, Applegarth led coming off the turn but was soon passed by Craig and Donald Lippincott.  The finish was close but Craig held off a fast-finishing Lippincott to win the sprint double.  Lippincott added the 200 silver medal to the bronze medal he had won in the 100.

Tom Dumoulin (Netherlands), Australia’s 2019 world champion Rohan Dennis, and Remco Evenepoel (Belgium), runner-up to Dennis at the 2019 Worlds, were all considered as potential Olympic medallists. The top two ranked UCI road cyclists Primož Roglič and Tadej Pogačar of Slovenia had to also be in contention after their recent run of successes. Also, worth watching was Italy’s Filippo Ganna, the 2020 world time trial champion.
The leader at the first split at 12.7 km was the last man to set off, Filippo Ganna, but he led Roglič by 0.59 sec. At the 15 km split, the Croat was in the lead but by an even smaller margin, 0.04 sec. over Wout van Aert, runner-up to van Ganna at the 2020 Word Championships. Roglič extended his lead to just over eight seconds at the halfway mark, at which stage Tom Dumoulin was second with Ganna still in third.
The next split saw Roglič increase his lead to over 30 seconds with Rohan Dennis second and Dumoulin in the bronze medal position. As Dennis skipped back on the penultimate split, Roglič was looking unbeatable with a 42 second lead over Dumoulin and Ganna in second and third place. The former ski jumper, and two times winner of the Vuelta a España, Roglič, posted a winning time of 55:04.19 (48.157 k/ph) and was over a minute ahead of Dumoulin and Dennis, who had pushed Ganna out of the bronze medal position, and into fifth place, with Switzerland’s Stefan Küng finishing fourth.

Henricks reinvented himself as a sprinter in 1953 and soon embarked on a spectacular run of success over the 100 metres or imperial equivalent. He won three gold medals at the British Empire and Commonwealth Games in 1956 and was successful on visits to the USA and Japan as well.
As such, Henricks was the favourite for the title in Melbourne and he lived up to his billing by setting a world record on his way to the Olympic championships. It was, however, a far closer race than anyone had predicted with Henricks being chased by teammate John Devitt until the very end.
Gary Chapman took bronze to compete a clean sweep for Australian on the medal podium – the first time ever Australia had swept any Olympic event. Henricks also had the honour of being the first Australian man to win Olympic gold on home soil.

The six final round teams were Yugoslavia and the Netherlands (Group A), the United States and Spain (Group B), and West Germany and Australia (Group C). In the medal pool, Yugoslavia and the United States won their first three games and faced each other in a match to determine the first two places. The United States was off to a 5-2 lead late in the third quarter, but they could not score again, and Yugoslavia came back to tie the match, 5-5, giving them the gold medal on goal differential.

Working as a bar singer in Las Vegas, under the name “Nikki Newland”, and fighting to overcome clinical depression, the short track demonstration inspired her to return to the sport. Known as an aggressive skater, Turner fell in the first turn of the final, causing a re-start. The unheralded Hwang Ok-Sil took the lead in the second attempt, soon to be overtaken by Turner. She was still in front at the final stretch, but Li was approaching quickly in the final metres. The two touched skates, but Turner was able to push over the line first.
While in training for the 1994 Winter Olympics, fourth place finisher Monique Velzeboer crashed into an unprotected barrier at a French training track, and became a paraplegic. Working from a wheelchair, she has since become a noted freelance photographer.

At the 1967 Pan American Games she won three individual gold medals, in both individual medleys and the 200 butterfly. In Mexico City she was entered only in her two best events, the IMs, and she came through, easily winning two gold medals. On 20 October she won gold in the 200 IM, with the 400 final set for 25 October. She had won the 200 by over four seconds but that paled in comparison to her dominance in this event. Winning by almost 14 seconds, the largest margin in Olympic women’s swimming since before World War II, at the finish Kolb was half-a-pool ahead of the silver medalist, her teammate Lynn Vidali. East German Sabine Steinbach, who had been touched out for bronze in the 200 IM, placed third over the fast closing American Sue Pedersen.

These two squads won their heats in the opening round, with the Hungarians posting the fastest time by 0.36 seconds. In the final, however, East Germany was the stronger crew and won gold by a margin of over one second. Hungary, meanwhile, came in for silver comfortably ahead of Bulgaria, who took bronze. Two members of the East German team, Anke Nothnagel and Birgit Schmidt, had already won the K-2 500 and thus became double Olympic champions, while the latter was also the runner-up in the K-1 500.

But with the former Soviet Union competing in 1992 as the Unified Team, only one athlete could represent them in this class, and Kosorotov was passed over for Khakhaleishvili. He and Ogawa were the two favorites, with the edge given to the Japanese. Ogawa did not disappoint early, winning his four pool matches, all in less than three minutes, two by ippon. Khakhaleishvili had been less impressive, winning his first match by ippon, but then needing the time limit to win his next three matches. But the final was dominated by the Georgian, as Khakhaleishvili threw Ogawa twice with tani-otoshi to win the gold medal in 1:04 by waza-ari-wasete ippon. France’s David Douillet won one bronze medal, but would soon become the dominant judoka in this division, winning the 1996 and 2000 Olympic titles, and three World Championships in 1993 and 1995, winning both the heavyweight and open classes in 1995. Ogawa continued judo through the 1996 Olympics, where he placed fifth, also winning bronze medals at the 1993 and 1995 World Championships.

This proved a masterstroke by the US officials as Lee proved to be the outstanding boxer in any of the weight divisions in Helsinki and was a worthy winner of the Val Barker Trophy for the best boxer at the Games. Lee was a graduate of Howard University and did not follow the usual career path for an American Olympic boxing champion and refused to turn professional. Instead he spent a lifetime working in adult education whilst also moonlighting as a judge in professional boxing.

At the five international 3,000 ms held in the 1987-1988 season, five East Germans had divided the medals. Three of them had won a race, and all three of them were racing in Calgary: Gabi Zange, Karin Kania and Andrea Ehrig. In fact, these three women had occupied the podium at the 1984 Olympics, when Ehrig had beaten Kania and Zange for the title. In the present season, Kania had won the World Cup races in Berlin and Butte, while Ehrig had won in Davos and at the European Championships. Zange had won the World Cup in Calgary, en passant breaking the world record and lowering it to 4:16.76. That record had been in the hands of Yvonne van Gennip, who had skated 4:16.85 in Heerenveen the previous season. But van Gennip had suffered from various injuries in the past months, and had recovered only just in time for the Olympics.
The race started dramatically, with Ehrig racing against Kania. The latter took off at an insane pace. Barely half-way through the race, Kania had a five-second advantage on Zange’s world record. Unsurprisingly, she hit the wall, and barely made it to the finish line, needing almost 40 seconds for the final lap. Ehrig, in the meanwhile, had been able to keep her pace, setting a world record of 4:12.09, well below the old mark. Zange herself, riding in the third pair, approximately matched her own world record (4:16.92), which was enough to beat Kania, but not Ehrig. Van Gennip was behind the leading times for the entire race, but not by far. With her final lap, she made up for the 0.63 second deficit, and crossed the line in 4:11.94, for a very surprising gold medal. It would be the first of her three Olympic titles in Calgary, matching the feat of her compatriot Ard Schenk in 1972.

Lindman was hampered by a poor start in shooting, finishing only 15th, and although he moved up with a fifth-place in swimming, he stood only seventh after two phases. Thofelt maintained the lead after fencing, finishing fourth with the épée. German Helmuth Kahl placed second in fencing and moved into second place overall. Lindman again struggled, finishing 22nd with the sword, and now in ninth place, his chances for gold, or even a medal, seemed remote. But he moved up into a tie for fourth place after the cross-country run, as Thofelt and Kahl continued to lead, despite mediocre running performances. After four phases, the places were Thofelt 1st with 33, Kahl 2nd with 40, Willem van Rhijn (NED) 3rd with 43, and Lindman tied with Italy’s Eugenio Pagnani in fourth with 45 points.

Kahl won bronze, the first medal ever won in modern pentathlon by a non-Swede. Thofelt would return to the Olympics in modern pentathlon in 1932 and 1936, but did not medal.

The silver went to Guatemalan Erick Barrondo, making this the first Olympic walk podium without a European, as Spain’s Miguel Ángel López placed fifth.
Chen took the lead from the start, leading at the halfway point with Wang in 40:08, but Chen poured it on over the last 10K, negative splitting with a final 38:38, and what Track & Field News described as a withering final lap in 7:31. The leaders were quite young, with Chen winning the day before his 20th birthday, while Wang was 20, and Barrondo and Cai only 21-years-old. Barrondo’s medal was the first ever Olympic medal for Guatemala.
The Chinese walk improvement was credited to Sandro Damilano, their Italian coach and the brother of 3-time Olympic medalist Maurizio Damilano. He stressed technique to the Chinese, who had earlier been known for frequent disqualifications but had long overcome that. One major surprise in the 20K walk was the poor showing of the Russian walkers.

This was one of the many events affected.
In January 2015 two Russians, Valeriy Borchin and Vladimir Kanaykin, were “disqualified” for biological passport offenses. Kanaykin had actually already been disqualified with three red cards, so effectively he was disqualified from having been disqualified, while Borchin, who did not finish in London, was thus disqualified from not finishing. In August 2017 the third Russian competitor, Andrey Krivov, who originally finished 37th, was also disqualified for a biological passport offense.
The three Russian walkers in the 50 km race were also all disqualified on re-testing. All Russians walkers were coached by Viktor Chegin, who was infamous for his athletes testing positive for PED usage, which more than 35 of them did between 2005-15. On 17 February 2016, Chegin was banned for life from athletics coaching by the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA).

It was the wind that was to play its part in one of the biggest shocks of the Rio diving competition with the elimination of World Champion He Chao. A disastrous third dive that was affected by the wind resulted in him scoring just 27.75 points and, despite a brilliant 91.00 with his next dive, he could not salvage his Games and was eliminated. It was his fellow countryman Cao Yuan, however, who dived third and set the benchmark with a six-dive total of 498.70. It was not until the 27th man out of 29 took to the board that Yuan’s lead was challenged, when Mexico’s Rommel Pacheco put in the best dive of the day for a 96.90, and a total of 488.25 put him in second place with Kristian Ipsen of the United States in third. The Jamaican Yona Knight-Wisdom qualified in 11th place. The defending champion Zakharov qualified in 18th and denied Britain’s Freddie Woodward a place in the semi-final. Ahmad Amsyar Azman of Malaysia finished 29th, and last, in the preliminaries but it may well have been different if his sixth and final dive had not resulted in him belly-flopping into the pool and scoring just 9.75.
Cao Yuan of China, Pacheco and Russia’s  Yevgeny Kuznetsov topped the semi-final qualifiers with Cao nearly 20 points clear. Zakharov crashed out after finishing in 18th and last place after his fourth dive, when he entered the water on all fours and failed to score. Despite three bad dives in the semi-final, Britain’s synchronised gold medallist Jack Laugher qualified in 12th and last place. Consequently, he was first to dive in the final. But what a difference a few hours made, as he had three dives in excess of 90 points for a tally of 523.85 that was there for all to beat. It was a long and anxious wait for the Briton as he waited for diver-after-diver to overtake him. After 11 men had dived the nearest anyone got to him was Patrick Hausding, the German outsider who produced a stunning fifth dive that yielded the highest score of the final, 98.80, but he was still nearly 25 points behind Laugher. There remained just one man to dive, the leading qualifier and London 2012 10-metres synchronised gold medallist Cao Yuan. Laugher had been trailing Yuan after each round and the Chinese diver needed 73.20 to take gold and, as his worst dive so far had been 85.00, it was unconceivable that he would lose. He saved his best for last and his 96.90 matched Laugher’s fifth dive and he beat the Briton by nearly 24 points .

But the plane crash of the American figure skating team near Brussels, while travelling to the 1961 World Championships, had decimated the US figure skating program. The 1961 Worlds were cancelled but in 1962-63, no American man made the podium, the best finish being fifth in 1963 by Scott Ethan Allen. There was no odds-on favorite in this event in Innsbruck. The last two world titles had been won by two Canadians – Don Jackson in 1962 and Donald McPherson in 1963. At the 1962 Worlds, Jackson had stunned the crowd with one of the great free skate performances ever, including the first clean landings of a triple Lutz and triple Salchow. The slight favorite was France’s Alain Calmat. Calmat had been third at the 1960 Worlds, and runner-up in 1962-63, but was European Champion in 1962-63. In the school figures, Manfred Schnelldorfer (FRG) pulled ahead, followed by compulsory specialist Karol Divín (TCH), who had also been second in 1960. Calmat was third, followed by the surprising Allen in fourth place. Schnelldorfer won the free skate as well, to win the gold medal. Calmat, later Minister of Spors in France, placed only fifth in free skating, but moved up the silver medal, and was even ranked first overall by two judges. Allen placed fourth in the free skate, but hung on to win a surprising, and inspirational, bronze medal for the US team. Described in some sources as “the young millionaire’s son,” he was waving to the audience during his free program, which resulted in a warning. Divín dropped to fourth after placing ninth in the free program.

Delfino then beat reigning champion Mangiarotti for the silver medal. All three men would return as part of the victorious Italian team in Rome with also adding the individual gold.

Only one event was held, a fancy diving competition on springboard.  A St. Louis doctor, Dr. George Sheldon, won the competition, defeating Germany’s Georg Hoffmann fairly easily.  The controversy in this event occurred in the battle for the bronze medal.  The American, Frank Kehoe, and a German, Alfred Braunschweiger, tied for third with 11.33 points.  The Germans protested this result, thinking that Braunschweiger had easily outperformed Kehoe.  A “dive-off” for third place was scheduled but Braunschweiger refused to compete and Kehoe was awarded the bronze medal.
The German commissioner to the World’s Fair, Dr. Theodore Lewald, had donated a trophy for the winning diver, but he was so incensed at the outcome that he refused to award it to Sheldon.  The controversy occurred because the Germans thought that they did fancier dives than the Americans, although the Americans protested that the Germans had poorer entries into the water.  The Germans, noting that the event was called a fancy diving contest, thought that was immaterial.  On 29 September, James Sullivan announced the ruling that the protest had not been allowed, although the decision had been made two weeks earlier. The Germans protested again, and this was, at first, overruled.  But two years later, the official result was announced as a tie for third place, although this was never accepted by the Americans, and the final result is disputed.
In many older sources this event is often described as a platform diving event, but that is incorrect. Photos show that it was held off a springboard, and diving historian Bob Clotworthy (1956 springboard gold medalist) has also maintained for several years that this was a springboard event.

All four of the favorites also advanced through the semi-final pools, with Russia placing first ahead of Italy in their pool. In the other pool, Hungary and Yugoslavia won one match each, had one win carried over, and when they met, they tied 4-4, with Hungary winning the pool by goal differential.
In the final round, Hungary and Yugoslavia would not meet, their match score carrying over from the semi-finals. Hungary defeated Italy 3-1, and the Soviet Union 5-2, while Yugoslavia defeated the Soviets 2-0, and Italy 2-1. This gave Hungary the gold medal by goal differential in the final round, with Yugoslavia second and the Soviets winning bronze. These same four teams had finished 1-4 at the last three Olympic Games (1956-64), and in 1952 the medalists had been Hungary, Yugoslavia, and Italy.

They protested the American racing style, which in their eyes made the competition “a parody of what a fine and fair speed race should be”. Their observation that races were skated at a slow pace to be decided in the final laps was shared by the organisation. For the 10000 m, each skater had to take the lead once, and lap times had to be 45 seconds or faster. Although this was intended to improve quality of the races, it just made things worse.
The first heat was won by Canada’s Alex Hurd, but he was disqualified later, following protests by Norway and Finland. Hurd had exceeded the minimum lap time during the race, as had third-placed Edwin Wedge (USA) and fifth-placed Shozo Ishihara (JPN). The second heat saw Bernt Evensen taking the lead, but he was fouled by Frank Stack of Canada, who passed the Norwegian on the inside. Evensen did manage to finish, and his protest against the Canadian was upheld by the referee. At this point, all four Norwegians had qualified for the final, giving them a great opportunity for teamwork.
However, the Canadians then protested, wanting the disqualifications of Hurd and Stack lifted. A formal meeting was held to discuss the situation, but no changes were made. The Canadians pressed on, and a compromise was reached in which the three disqualified skaters from the first heat, including Hurd, would be allowed to skate in the final. This did not satisfy the Canadian delegation, and Patrick Mulqueen (chairman of the Canadian NOC) then threatened to withdraw his country’s delegation from the Games. The other nations eventually gave in, and the referee decided that the heats would be re-run the next morning, and the final was moved to 8 February.
The skaters themselves had not been present at these meetings, and upon finding out the heat results had been annulled, they protested, led by the Americans and Norwegians. It took an hour before they could be persuaded to compete - according to the Norwegians the Americans were slipped dollar bills by the town mayor so they would skate. Remarkably, the results were the same as  in the original races (not counting the disqualifications), but this meant six North Americans faced two Europeans in the final.
For 24 laps, the race was slow-paced, only to explode in the final lap. Jaffee took the lead, but the pack was close and there was a lot of pushing. Hurd and Schroeder fell in the final curve, while Jaffee sped away towards the finish line. In an attempt to throw himself at the finish line, he fell but stayed ahead of Ivar Ballangrud, Frank Stack and Edwin Wedge, who also hit the ice in an attempt to move into bronze medal position.

His last, and final world record, was 15.54 (51-0), set at a meeting of the Olympic Club in San Francisco on 21 August 1909.  He was still dominant, winning the AAU title in 1909 and 1910, but that was his last major title.

Pat McDonald was far behind at that point.  He led Group Three of the qualifying, but posted a mark of almost ½-metre behind Rose - 14.78.  In the final, McDonald took the lead with his first put, setting a new Olympic record of 15.34.  Rose could not improve his qualifying mark and had to settle for the silver medal.

But he had several strong contenders, among them the American Buddy Edelen, who in 1963 had broken the world record with 2-14:28 in the Polytechnic race in Britain, and had also won the Košice marathon in Czechoslovakia in 2-15:09.6. Britain had two top marathoners in Basil Heatley and Brian Kilby. Japan was led by Toru Terasawa, who had won the 1963 Fukuoka Marathon, and broken the world record early in 1963 at the Beppu Marathon.
But there was only Bikila. The race began at 1 PM, and was contested over a very flat straight out-and-back course. Bikila ran in the lead pack right from the start. By the turnaround point, this time running in shoes, he was leading by 15 seconds, and from there to the finish, he simply extended the lead, winning by over four minutes. Heatley finished second, but had been third entering the stadium. Third went to a native son, not Terasawa, but rather Kokichi Tsuburaya, who was passed by Heatley on the final turn in the stadium. Brian Kilby finished fourth, and Buddy Edelen, hampered by a sciatic nerve injury, placed sixth.
Tsuburaya was crushed that he had been passed on the track by Heatley in front of the Japanese crowd. He vowed to improve and pushed himself in training, but it resulted in multiple injuries. Finally, in early January 1968, he committed suicide by slashing his carotid artery with a razor blade. The note he left said simply, “Cannot run anymore.”

His only major challenger was expected to be world leader Ivan Tikhon of Belarus, but he was pulled from the Games after re-testing of drug samples from the 2004 Olympics and 2005 Worlds, where he had won silver and gold, respectively. Slovenia’s Primož Kozmus, the defending gold medalist, was left as Pars’ major remaining gold medal contender. One other contender was Poland’s Paweł Fajdek, but he did not get past qualifying, just missing with a sector foul of 78+ metres.
Kozmus opened with 78.97 in round one to take an early lead, but on the next throw, Pars went into the lead with 79.14, a lead he would never relinquish. Kozmus fouled his next two throws, and in round three, Pars hammered the ball out to 80.59, which was the eventual gold-medal winning mark. Kozmus improved his mark in round five with 79.36 but stayed in second. Japan’s Koji Murofushi, the 2004 Olympic and 2011 World gold medalist, moved into third in the third round with 78.71 and that held on for a bronze medal. The podium was the same as at the 2011 Worlds, but the order was different, as Murofushi had been first there, with Pars second and Kozmus third.
That was how the event and the results seemed to have ended. In 2015, however, the IOC began re-testing samples from the 2008 Beijing and 2012 London Olympics, using newer, more advanced testing techniques, in an effort to find those who had used performance enhancing drugs (PEDs), but in whom it could not be detected at the time of those Olympics. This was one of the many events affected.
Four athletes in this event were disqualified after they were found to have used turinabol (dehydrochloromethyltestosterone). The top finisher to be DQed was Russian Kirill Ikonnikov, who originally finished fifth. Also disqualified were Dilshod Nazarov (TJK / 10th), Oleksandr Dryhol (UKR / 34th) and Pavel Krivitsky (BLR / 28th), who topped off his turinabol with a stanozolol chaser.

They had been training on the country’s only track near the Latvian town of Sigulda, and consequently most lugers from the USSR were Latvians. They especially came to the forefront in the women’s competitions. In 1977, Vera Zozuļa won a silver medal at the World Championships, upgrading her performance to first place the next year. At Lake Placid, she was clearly the best in competition, winning each of the four runs. Behind her, fellow Latvian Ingrīda Amantova battled with reigning World Champion Melitta Sollmann, Ilona Brand (both DDR) and two-time European Champion Elisabeth Demleitner (FRG) for the remaining medals. After three runs, Amantova and Brand were in medal positions, but both had a relatively poor final run, and Sollmann moved up to silver medal position, while Brand dropped off the podium.

Geisenberger’s dominance of the sport was such that she won 15 of the 19 races she had contested over last two seasons and had never placed outside the top two. She set the standard on the first run with the only time below 50 seconds (49.891), comfortably ahead of American Erin Hamlin , reigning champion Tatjana Hüfner and Tatyana Ivanova of Russia. In the second run Hamlin and  Hüfner changed places, although Geisenberger was dominant, again posting the only sub-50 second time (49.923) to lead by a large margin (by luge standards) of 0.766 seconds over her countrywoman. Ivanova had a disappointing run to push her down to 7th but, also for the home nation, Nataliya Khoreva was fourth fastest and moved up to 4th place.
The third and fourth runs were more of the same, Geisenberger, Hüfner and Hamlin setting the three fastest times in each run and finally finishing in that order. Again Geisenberger went under 50 seconds in her third run (49.765) and, by her standards, had a conservative fourth run of 50.189. Her margin of victory over second placed Hüfner was a staggering (by luge standards) 1.139 seconds, with the American a further 0.238 second behind. For Hamlin, this was the first ever medal won by a woman luger from the United States.
In May 2016 WADA (World Anti-Doping Agency) commissioned a report, the McLaren Report, to look into allegations of systematic Russian doping and a cover-up to avoid positives at the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics. The report was released in two parts, in July and December 2016, and confirmed the allegations. In 2017 the IOC formed a commission to investigate this, headed by IOC Member Denis Oswald, and usually referred to as the Oswald Commission. In late October 2017 the Oswald Commission began to release its findings. On 22 December 2017 Tatyana Ivanova, the original seventh-place finisher, was disqualified as a result of the Oswald Commission findings.

The event was run along the Viale Oceano Pacifico, with 32 teams racing the three laps over a 33.33 km. course from Roma to Ostia and back. This event began the 1960 Olympic cycling program. Although it started at 0900, the day was hot, with temperatures reaching 34° C. (93° F.). Italy dominated the race, winning by over two minutes from Germany, which had all East German riders. Italy was led by the eventual runner-up in the individual road race, Livio Trapè, while the GDR team was led by Gustav-Adolf Schur, who had been world amateur road champion in 1958-59. The Soviet Union won the bronze medal, led by Viktor Kapitonov, who would outsprint Trapè to win the road race gold medal.
Unfortunately, the story of the race was the death of the first Olympian in competition since the 1912 Olympics, when Portugal’s Francisco Lázaro died during the marathon. The Danish team was in mid-race when one of the riders, Knut Enemark Jensen, began to ride erratically. He had difficulty keeping on the wheel of his teammates and finally, after several minutes of this problem, collapsed off his bike. He was taken to hospital and died a few hours later. The official verdict was initially given as a victim of sunstroke (heat stroke), although other reports mention that he had sustained a fractured skull during his fall. Media reports noted that the Danish team doctors admitted giving Jensen Roniacol, a vasodilator, and initial reports attributed his death to drugs. However, the post-mortem examination was never directly released and drugs as a cause of his death has never been proven, but in Davis Maraniss’s book Rome 1960: The Olympics that Changed the World, he noted, “Decades later a Danish journalist tracked down Doctor Alberto Marpiori, one of  the Italians who had performed Jensen’s autopsy. The doctor said that he remembered the case well as it was the first time his institute had found evidence of doping. He said several substances, including amphetamines, were found in Jensen’s system.” Jensen’s death, along with the later death of Tom Simpson in the 1967 Tour de France, were two of the high-publicity factors that pushed the International Olympic Committee to institute drug testing at the 1968 Olympics.

In the semi-final of the 2019 World Championships, Krasniqi was defeated by Funa Tonaki from Japan. Further honours, however, including the European title in 2021, earned her the top-ranking spot. In her four bouts, Krasniqi did not require the Golden Score once. She won the first two by Ippon (full point), against Lin Chen-Hao from Chinese Taipei after just 19 seconds. After losing to Mönkhbatyn Urantsetseg for bronze at the 2021 World Championships, Krasniqi took revenge and defeated the three-time Olympian and 2013 World Champion from Mongolia in the semi-final by Waza-ari (half point) for an O-soto-gari. In the final, she again met the home favourite Tonaki, world champion in 2017 and runner-up in 2018 and 2019. Krasniqi prevailed via Waza-ari with an Uchi-mata (Inner thigh throw). By winning silver, Tonaki claimed the first medal for Japan at the Tokyo Olympics. She had eliminated reigning Olympic champion, Paula Pareto of Argentina, in the quarter-final.
Bronze went to Mönkhbatyn and Dariya Bilodid from Ukraine, maybe the most successful judoka in this class since Rio with two titles at both the World Championships (2018, 2019) and the European Championships (2017, 2019).

Besbes, eight times gold medalist at the African Championships, and bronze medalist at the 2015 World Championships, did at least advance to the quarter-finals, but Xu and épée legend Logunova both lost their first bouts. London 2012 gold medalist Yana Shemiakina from Ukraine also failed to make the quarter-final.

The 33-year-old from Budapest had never won a title at the Olympics, World or European Championships before. She enjoyed her most successful seasons in 2010 and 2011 when she won the World Cup series in both years. In the semi-final in Rio Szász defeated Rembi with a score of 10–6. In the second semi-final Fiamingo stopped Sun Yiwen’s advance with a narrow 12–11 victory. The gold medal bout was also close. The Italian started as the dominant fencer, but couldn’t shake off Szász, who always stayed in touch. The Hungarian came from behind, trailing 12–11 at the start of the final three minutes. Subsequently, she scored four points against only one by Fiamingo to secure her victory by 15–13. China’s Sun defeated Rembi to win the bronze medal by another narrow 15–13 scoreline.

The favorite was the Irishman, John Daly, while the top American runner, Jim Lightbody, was contesting his first steeplechase.  After one lap, Daly led by 10 yards over Harvey Cohn, with Lightbody in second, another 10 yards back.  After two laps, Daly had opened up a 40-yard lead, and he still led going to the last lap, though the margin is given variously as either 15 or 60 yards.  At this point, Daly balked at the water jump, and must have virtually collapsed, for not only was he caught by Lightbody on the last lap, but Lightbody pulled away to win by about 100 yards.  Arthur Newton, who had never contended, finished third, another 30 yards behind Daly.
Jim Lightbody attended the University of Chicago and represented the Chicago AA.  Although he won three gold medals at the 1904 Olympics, he was relatively unknown prior to that time.

Although these two competitors were the favorites to win gold, there were other less likely contenders in Sydney. Derek Porter of Canada, for example, was the reigning Pan American champion, Olympic runner-up, and World bronze medalist, as well as the 1993 World Champion, and there were many other seasoned veterans at the Games such as Václav Chalupa, Jr. of the Czech Republic, Jüri Jaanson of Estonia, and Sergio Fernández of Argentina.
Waddell posted the fasted time in the opening round, with Porter, Müller, and Germany’s Marcel Hacker, victor in the 1999 Diamond Challenge Sculls at the Henley Royal Regatta, winning the other heats. Fernández, meanwhile, was eliminated in the repêchage. Chalupa suffered the same fate in the semi-finals in a heat won Müller, while Waddell again took the round in the fastest time. The New Zealander’s success continued in the final, where he won the gold medal by a margin of over a second and a half. The next three finishers, however, had just over half a second between them and battled down to the line for the remaining podium spots. When the waves settled, Müller had just barely held on to silver, by 0.28 seconds, while Hacker had managed to steal bronze from Porter by 0.27 seconds. One other notable participant was Andris Reinholds of Latvia, who became the first Olympic rower to be disqualified from the Games for doping, as he tested positive for nandrolone. Even though he was eventually relegated to the B final, his participation might have had a small impact on the event, for he helped eliminate Fernández by winning his repêchage heat.

In 1960, he had bettered the world record five times, moving it up to 2.22 (7-3¾) at the US Olympic Trials. The next best jumper on height was Soviet Valery Brumel at 2.17 (7-1½). The two other Soviet jumpers, Robert’ Shavlaq’adze and Viktor Bolshov, were considered slight threats, as was defending champion Charlie Dumas, but Thomas may have been the heaviest favorite in any athletics event at Roma. In the final, he led early, clearing 2.00, 2.06, and 2.09, with passes at 2.03 and 2.12. At 2.12 (6-11½), Shavlaq’adze and Bolshov had first jump clearances, and Brumel went over on his third attempt. Bolshov was leading as he had not yet missed. That was a PR for Shavlaq’adze who had previously jumped only 2.11 (6-11). At 2.14 (7-0¼) the three Soviets and Thomas got over, but only Shavlaq’adze did so on his first attempt moving into the lead. With the bar at 2.16 (7-1), Shavladq’adze cleared on his first attempt to win the gold medal, Brumel having one miss. Thomas and Bolshov failed to make the height and Thomas had to settle for the bronze medal.

157551,"Coxless Pairs, Men",1908 Summer Olympics,5,Rowing,/editions/5/sports/ROW,28 – 31 July 1908,"Henley Royal Regatta Course, Henley-on-Thames",8 from 3 countries,1½ miles,na,"The European championship had always been won by a Belgian or Italian pair, although with coxswain, but neither nation entered a pair. At Henley, the event for coxless pairs is The Silver Goblets and Nickalls Challenge Cup. It was won in 1906-1907 by Banner Johnstone and Ronald Powell, and in 1908 by Harold Barker and Albert Gladstone, but neither pair entered the Olympic event. Johnstone and Gladstone competed at the Olympics for Leander in the winning eight-oared crew, while Barker competed for the gold-medal winning Leander four.
The Olympic final came down to the two British pairs, both representing the Leander Club. Fenning and Thomson opened on 38 strokes and opened 3/4 length lead by the time they passed Temple Island. They continued to pull away and were never really challenged.
The silver and bronze medalists listed below are controversial. It seems likely that only gold medals, and no silver or bronze medals, were given. The rules, as given in the 1908 Official Report (p. 528), note, “The Winners or Winner of the events will each receive the British Olympic Council’s Gold Medal for the Olympic Games of 1908.”  And on another page of the 1908 Official Report (p. 37), one finds under Rowing, “Prizes: - Gold Olympic Medals to the winners in each Event.”  There is no mention of silver or bronze medals in either place. In the results section of the 1908 Official Report (p. 358). the four rowing events are listed, with only the winners listed under gold medals. No silver or bronze medal placements are listed.
Because of the set-up of the Henley course, only two crews or sculls competed at any one time. Thus the semi-finals and finals consisted of only two crews or single scullers. Certainly the losing finalist would seem to be considered the “silver medalist” although we do not know if those rowers actually received such a medal. In addition, it would seem natural, and consistent with other Olympic sports with head-to-head formats, such as boxing and tennis, to consider the losing semi-finalists as “bronze medalists.”
Olympic statisticians vary on the listing of these results. Erich Kamper, in Encyclopaedia of the Olympic Games, listed the losing semi-finalists in the single sculls and eights as finishing third, but he did not list the losing semi-finalists that way in the coxed pairs or coxed fours. Both Volker Kluge (Die Olympischen Spiele von 1896 bis 1980) and David Wallechinsky (The Complete Book of the Summer Olympics) consider all the losing semi-finalists as finishing in 3rd place. But in his more recent book, Olympische Sommerspiele: Die Chronik I, Kluge did not describe the losing semi-finalists as bronze medalists.
However, in keeping with our Guidelines (see Updates–>Guidelines), we have considered the losing finalists as silver medalists (2nd place) and both the losing semi-finalists as bronze medalists (3rd place). In those guidelines we note, “we consider all participants being placed first, second or third in the final standings to have received gold, silver or bronze medals respectively.”

Also considered were the 2010 silver medalists from China, Pang Qing and Tong Jian, who had been 2010 World Champions. The German and Chinese teams had to overcome the home crowd and history, as a Russian or Soviet pair had won this title at every Olympics since 1964, except for 2010.
The short program went as expected with Volosozhar and Trankov leading comfortably over Sawtchenko and Szolkowy, with Pang and Tong in fourth place, behind the relatively unknown Russian team of Kseniya Stolbova and Fyodor Klimov, who had been recent runners-up at the European Championships but whose only semi-major title had been winning the 2013 Winter Universiade.
In the free skate Volosozhar and Trankov won easily, winning the gold medal by a huge margin over their teammates, Stolbova and Klimov, who moved up to the silver medal by placing second in the free skate. Pang and Tong placed third in the free skate but could not move onto the podium as Sawtchenko and Szolkowy repeated their bronze medal.
Volosozhar and Trankov had already won gold medals in the team trophy competition in Sochi, so they became the first figure skaters to win two gold medals at one Winter Olympics. They also became the first pair to win an Olympic gold medal in front of their home crowd since Germans Maxi Herber and Ernst Baier at Garmisch-Partenkirchen in 1936. The two medals for Russia marked the 9th time in the last 13 Winter Olympics that Russian or Soviet pairs had won two Olympic medals in the event.

France got off to the lead on the opening leg, swum by Mehdy Metella, but the second US swimmer was some guy named Michael Phelps, and after 200 metres, he had given the USA a full second lead, which even France’s redoubtable Florent Manadou, swimming their third leg, could not overcome.

They soon found the sights inadequate.  The rules specified the prone position for this match, with no artificial support.  The officials ruled that the ground was obviously not artificial and that the shooters therefore could rest their rifles on the ground.  Strangely, only the Swedish team seemed to know about this, and they took full advantage of the knowledge, resting both the left hand and forearm and the butt of the rifle on the firing line.  The English raised quite a fuss about this, but lost and went on to win by shooting ability, 762 to the Swedes’ 748, with the United States four points behind, for a third out of the six teams.”
The event is listed as “Miniature Rifle, Any Position” in the 1912 Official Report, as with the individual event, but as prone is by far the most stable position, it is likely that all competitors shot in the prone position.

The sled had been left overnight in a garage and was found badly damaged in the morning.  Though the press cried foul it was eventually discovered to be the result of a clumsy parking manoeuvre rather than anything sinister.
When the event began it became apparent that the two Swiss bobs were in a class of their own. Having placed 1-2 when the World Championships visited the same track the previous winter it became a simple matter of whether the relative youngster Felix Endrich could overcome the 39-year old veteran of the Garmisch Olympics, Fritz Feierabend, pilot of the 1947 World Champion sled.
The gold medal was decided on the first day on competition when Endrich’s team built up a lead of over two and a half seconds. Feierabend closed the gap on second day but the damage was already done and Endrich and brakeman Fritz Waller were crowned as champions.The battle for the bronze medal was also closely contested but was decided in favour of the number two USA team ahead of Belgium.

After failing to make the 2012 Kenyan Olympic team, he moved to the road and quickly became almost unbeatable at the marathon. From 2013-16 he won six major city marathons, winning all except the 2013 Berlin Marathon, and breaking 2-05 four times. He came to Rio as a clear favorite, but Olympic marathon favorites have not usually fared well.
The heat and humidity on the last day of the Olympics kept the pace slow, as is usual in the Olympic marathon. At 30K Kipchoge picked up the pace and strung out the field, leaving only two runners by his side with 10 km remaining, American Galen Rupp, silver medallist in the London 10K, who had only run his first marathon at the US Olympic Trials, and Ethiopian Feyisa Lilesa. Kipchoge surged again at 35K and Rupp could not maintain the pace, with Lilesa struggling to stay close. With 6 km remaining Kipchoge was alone, the gold medal decided if disaster did not strike. It did not and the Kenyan won the gold by 1:10 over Lilesa, who was 11 seconds ahead of Rupp, who was closing the margin, but ran out of ground.
In early May 2017, Kipchoge ran a trial race, staged by Nike, in an attempt to break the 2-hour barrier for the marathon. The two other participants in the race were Ethiopian Lelisa Desisa and Eritrean Zersenay Tadesse. The event was held on the Monza race track in Italy, with designated pacers entering the event planned stages. The runners ran behind a pace vehicle, designed to keep them on the ideal pace, but it also provided drafting protection, one of the factors keeping the event from being eligible for record consideration. Drinks were handed to the runners, as needed, by helpers on bicycles, another move that made it ineligible for a record. Finally, all three marathoners wore newly designed, special Nike shoes, and there was some question about their legality for record purposes. In the end, only Kipchoge came close to the barrier, running a “fastest on record” time of 2-00:25, although it was not considered for a world best time, because of the problems noted above.
By the late 2010s Kipchoge had stamped himself as the dominant marathoner in the world and many considered him the greatest ever, perhaps rivalled only by Abebe Bikila. From 2013-19 Kipchoge ran 13 marathons, winning all but the 2013 Berlin race, in which he finished second. At Berlin in 2018 he set a world record of 2-01:39, and in 2019, at the London Marathon, his winning time of 2-02:37 was the second fastest marathon ever.

With the 56 kg class being discontinued after the Rio Games, this was now the 61 kg class and was the “heaviest” lightest weight ever contested. Between 1920-36 it was 60 kg, and between 1948-2016 the lightest weight was at weights between 52 and 56 kg.
There were two clear favourites in China’s Li Fabin and Indonesia’s Eko Irawan. Li was the reigning 2019 world champion, and won silver behind Irawan in 2018. Li was also the winner of the last two Asian Championships in 2019 and 2020 (held in April 2021), and was the reigning world record holder in snatch (145 kg) and total (318 kg). Irawan, competing in his fourth Olympics, was world champion in 2018 and the gold medallist (in the 62 kg category) at the 2018 Asian Games, when China was suspended by the International Weightlifting Federation. Irawan was also the world record holder in clean & jerk with 174 kg. Other participants included Thạch Kim Tuấn, gold medallist at the 2010 Youth Olympics and world champion in 2017 (both 56 kg class), Seraj Al-Saleem, season best 286 kg, and silver medallist at the last Asian Championships, Igor Son, qualification best 286 kg, and silver medallist at the last World Championships, and Shota Mishvelidze, qualification best 293 kg, silver medallist at the 2021 European Championships. The gold medallist at the last European Championships, Stilyan Grozdev, was not present in Tokyo as the Bulgarian federation was restricted to two male and two female lifters over all classes following more than ten doping violations. Also, not present in Tokyo was Francisco Mosquera (Colombia), season best 280 kg, world champion 2017 (62 kg) and bronze medallist at the last World Championships, who had previously missed the 2016 Olympics due to an injury. Ferdi Hardal (Turkey), with a season best 287 kg, and bronze medallist from the 2021 European Championships, also originally qualified for Tokyo. Mosquera was ranked fourth and Hardal ranked eighth, but their federations did not select them because of the restriction following many doping offences.
When Li and Irawan started with their snatch attempts all other competitors had already ended all their attempts with Yoichi Itokazu being in the lead with 133 kg. Irawan lifted 137 kg in his first attempt while Li failed at the same weight, but Irawan was not able to lift 141 kg in his next two attempts, while Li cleared 137 kg with his second and 141 kg with his third lift. This gave Li a margin of 4 kg before the clean & jerk; here again all other lifters had already finished their attempts with Son lifting 163 kg in his last attempt after Itokazu had already missed 162 kg in his final lift. That put Son in the bronze medal position, but he had to wait until Shota Mishvelidze and Seraj Al-Saleem had finished their attempts as both tried to lift weights good enough for bronze, but both failed. While Itokazu finished fourth, Irawan managed 165 kg in his first attempt, but as Li countered with 166 kg and also lifted 172 kg, Irawan had to go for a new world record, but missed the remaining two attempts over 177 kg. This gave Li gold and Irawan his second silver medal to go with the one he collected in 2016. Together with his two bronze medals from 2008 and 2012, Irawan’s medal tally increased to four, which made him the first and only Indonesian to win four medals at the Olympics. Remarkable was Li’s 166 kg clean & jerk lift, when he shifted his weight onto one leg and sticking out his right leg bringing it completely up off the ground, a move he had already shown in other competitions and called by his fans the “flamingo lift”. He said he is doing this to correct his balance, not to impress the jury or the crowd.
The Olympic Standard for Olympic records was 142 kg for snatch, 171 kg for clean & jerk, and 310 kg for total. The standard was not reached in snatch, but in clean & jerk and total, Li established a record with 172 kg and 313 kg, respectively. China won its second gold medal at the Tokyo Games and Indonesia won its second medal with silver, after Windy Aisah won bronze the day before.

Gustafson started in the second pair, and set a top mark, finishing in 14:39.95, which looked like it could win the gold medal on the slow Sarajevo ice. Two pairs later, Malkov, who had won the silver medal at 5,000 behind Gustafson, and had won the 5,000 at the 1984 Europeans, started at a very consistent pace. With three laps remaining, he was over a second behind Gustafson’s pace, but he finished more strongly, and posted 14:39.90 to narrowly take the lead. Nobody came close to their times. In the third pair, East German René Schöfisch, had finished in 14:46.91, which would win him the bronze medal, matching the bronze he had won in the 5,000. In 1988, Gustafson would win gold medals at Calgary in both the 5 and 10K. Malkov was the youngest ever Olympic gold medalist at the time, and remains so through 2006, at only 19 years, 8 days on the day of this event.

His opponent in the final, Sweden’s Ingemar Johansson, appeared to be completely intimidated by the American’s reputation and spent most of the fight backpedalling around the ring. When Sanders did get into range Johansson would simply grab hold of his opponent. Eventually an increasingly irate referee grew tired of warning the Swede and disqualified him for “not trying”. This also had the effect of denying Johansson his silver medal and the second step on the podium remained vacant.
Sanders, a member of the US Navy, turned professional in 1954 with high expectations but these were derailed when he lost only his fourth pro fight. In December 1954 he was knocked out by Willie James in a fight at the Boston Garden. Sanders was rushed to hospital with a blood clot on the brain and succumbed to his injury, dying three days later.
Ironically it was Johansson who became a household name as a professional when he became the first European to win the World Heavyweight Championship for over 20 years after knocking out fellow Olympic champion Floyd Patterson. In 1982, 30 years after his Olympic embarrassment, Johansson was finally awarded his silver medal after the IOC were persuaded to reverse their decision.

Soviet women had held the first four places at the last three World Championships, including the recent 1960 Worlds. In fact, at the World Championships, the last time any non-Soviet skater had mounted the all-around podium was in 1952, a third place by Norway’s Randi Thorvaldsen. The three Soviet entrants in the event were Klara Guseva, Lidiya Skoblikova, and Tamara Rylova.
Guseva was up in the first pair, and finished in 1:34.1, not far off Rylova’s world record, which had been set at Medeo, and had lasted since 1955. In the fourth pair, Germany’s Helga Haase, who had surprisingly won the 500 two days before. She went out ahead of Guseva’s pace, but could not finish as strongly, crossing in 1:34.3. Rylova was in the sixth pair, and she matched Haase’s pace through 600 metres but was even slower on the final lap, finishing in 1:34.8. And those three would mount the podium. Skoblikova was in the 10th pair, but finished in 1:35.3 for fourth place. She had already won the 1,500 at Squaw Valley and would later win the 3,000. In 1964 she would dominate the women’s events, winning all four gold medals. Guseva had won this distance at the recent 1960 World Championships, but had placed only 15th overall, and was the least heralded of the Soviet women.

Given that the outcome of the 10 kilometres event had largely been affected by the weather conditions, it was felt unlikely that the medallists from that event would end on the podium after the 12.5 kilometres pursuit section. For Emil Hegle Svendsen of Norway and Croatia’s Jakov Fak, who started 2nd and 3rd, this proved to be the case, these biathletes eventually finishing in 8th and 25th place respectively. In the end it was the Swede Bjorn Ferry and Christoph Sumann of Austria who started at 1:12 and 1:25 behind the first starter Vincent Jay, who moved from 8th to 1st and 12th to 2nd , respectively, to take the gold and silver medals. Jay did well to hold on to the bronze medal by 2.8 seconds from another Austrian, the fast finishing Simon Eder, mainly by virtue of his time in the 10 kilometres event.
Ferry, an outspoken opponent of doping in sport, had competed at the top level since 2001 but had never previously won a medal at world or Olympic level. His wife, Heidi Andersson, was an eight-time world champion in the sport of arm-wrestling.

It was a new addition to the Olympic Games but featured in the UCI Track Cycling World Championships where, for three of the past four years, it was dominated by Australians Kaarle McCulloch and Anna Meares. Their only loss had come in the most recent edition, when the Germans Kristina Vogel and Miriam Welte burst onto the scene and stole the title, twice setting a world record during the event. The British team of Vicki Pendleton and Jessica Varnish, as well as the Chinese team Gong Jinjie and Guo Shuang, were considered to be strong competitors as well, although many believed that the gold medal match would come to a showdown between the Germans and the Australians.
Unfortunately, the event’s début at the Olympics bordered on disastrous. It began with a fairly auspicious start, with Great Britain setting a world record in the qualification round that was almost immediately broken by the Chinese. In the semi-finals, however, Great Britain won their heat with the second fastest time in the round, thus allowing them the opportunity to compete for gold, but lost the chance when they were relegated for an early exchange – Pendleton passed Varnish too early – disqualifying them from the competition. Australia won its heat, but only posted the third-fastest time (even after Britain’s relegation) and were left to contest bronze against Ukraine. China seemed to be the only team that fared well in this round, once again setting a world record, but met the same fate as the British in the semis. Even though the Chinese team earned gold in their race against Germany, they were relegated to silver for an early exchange of their own. Australia, meanwhile, easily won its match and took home bronze, but seemed somewhat disheartened at the missed opportunity to take the inaugural Olympic title.

Kibiegon and Hassan were evenly matched, having split their two races in 2021, with Kibiegon having a slight head-to-head margin with 8 wins to Hassan’s 6. Their PRs were also close, Kibiegon at 3:51.07 to Hassan’s 3:51.95.
The heats were run on 2 August in the morning and that evening Hassan ran the 5K, winning gold in that event. She and Kibiegon qualified for the 1,500 final where they were joined by Britain’s Laura Muir, expected to be medal contender, but for Hassan qualifying was anything but easy. She fell at the beginning of the bell lap when a runner fell in front of her, and she tripped over her. Hassan quickly got to her feet and caught the field, and then outkicked everyone to win the heat.
In the final Hassan took the early lead but she and Kibiegon were at the lead through three laps as Muir and Canada’s Gabriela Stafford exchanged places just behind them. At the bell Hassan upped the pace but, on the backstretch, Kibiegon went past her and continued to increase her lead to the finish line. Kibiegon recorded 3:53.11, the sixth fastest time ever and an Olympic record, to win gold.
Behind her, Laura Muir passed Hassan as well and won silver in a British record 3:54.50, while Hassan held on for bronze. A few days later, she would complete an unprecedented triple when she also won the 10,000.

In 1999 she had been World bronze medalist with Rachael Taylor, with whom she partnered in Sydney.  The fastest time in the opening heat, however, went to Doina Ignat and Georgeta Damian of Romania, while the other one was taken by South Africa’s Helen Fleming and Colleen Orsmond, despite the presence of both Australia and Canada. Ignat was a 1996 Olympic champion in the coxed eights, while Damian was a 1997 World runner-up in the coxless pairs. In the final, the Romanians won a comfortable distance ahead of the Australians, who had to battle the American duo of Missy Schwen and Karen Kraft to capture silver, which they did by a mere 0.04 seconds. This left the Americans with bronze, as the Canadians struggled and did not arrive at the finish until almost three seconds after the United States. Ignat and Damian, meanwhile, were double Olympic champions at the Games, as they also took home gold from the coxed eights.

The defending champion and world record holder was Norway’s Hjalmar Andersen, and he had won the distance most recently at the 1954 Europeans, but he was no longer the dominant skater he had been from 1950-52, having briefly retired in 1952-53. Another favorite was Soviet Oleg Goncharenko, runner-up at the 1954 and 1955 World Championships in all-around, who had won the 10,000 at the 1954 Worlds. Also to be considered was Norway’s Knut Johannesen, second at the distance at the 1955 World Championships.
Goncharenko was the first contender up, in the third pair, and he surprised everybody by breaking Andersen’s Olympic record with a time of 16:42.3. Johannesen was in the seventh pair, and went even faster, finishing in 16:36.9, after having been below world record pace for much of the race. Ericsson, who had been injured earlier in the season in a football match and had only recently recovered, was up three pairs later and set a very fast pace, even threatening Andersen’s world record of 16:32.6. At 8,000 metres, he was almost four seconds faster than Johannesen. He could not hold that pace, and slowed gradually in the final 2K, but he held on to win the gold medal by a full second, in 16:35.9. Hjalmar Andersen was in one of the late pairs and placed sixth in 16:52.6, despite having been ahead of Ericsson’s pace for the early part of the race.
This was the only 1956 speed skating event not won by a Soviet skater, who were making their Olympic débuts. For Ericsson this was the peak of his career and he would only compete internationally for one more year. Johannesen, however, had a long career ahead of him. He won the 1957 and 1964 World Championships in all-around and the European Championships in 1959-60, and was always formidable at the longer distances. In 1960 at Squaw Valley he would win the gold medal in this event, finishing the race in 15:46.6, finally breaking Andersen’s world record, set in 1952, and by a full 46 seconds.

There were expected to be two Europeans contending, Ragnar Lundberg (SWE), 1952 bronze medalist and 1950 European Champion, and 1954 European Champion, Eeles Landström of Finland. They would finish fifth and seventh respectively. The best European turned out to be the surprising Georgios Roubanis (GRE), who was the first vaulter to use a fiberglass pole in a major international competition. He used it to good effect, clearing a PR 4.50 (14-9) and winning the bronze medal. Richards won the competition for gold fairly easily. He jumped every height from 4.15 (13-7¼) to 4.53 (14-10¼) and had no misses. He then cleared 4.56 (14-11½) on his third attempt for the gold medal. Still with him at that height was American Bob Gutowski, who had missed four times at earlier heights, and failed to clear 4.56 (14-11½), earning the silver medal. In April 1957, Gutowski vaulted 4.78 (15-8¼) in a collegiate dual meet for a world record, finally breaking the vaunted world record of 4.77 (15-7¾) set by Cornelius “Dutch” Warmerdam in 1942. Richards predicted that Gutowski would become the first 16-foot vaulter but he was killed in a car crash in August 1960.

The Olympic Program in 1996 also added this race, dropping the team time trial. The favorite was Spain’s Miguel Induráin. Induráin had competed in the Olympic road race in 1984, but failed to finish. He turned professional in 1985, but struggled at his first few attempts in the Tour de France. Finally, in 1991 he won the Tour, and he would then win it from 1991-95, only the fourth five-time winner of the Tour, and the first to do it five times consecutively. Induráin’s specialty was the individual time trial, the contre la montre to the French, but also known as the “Race of Truth,” because it so often determined the champion in major stage races.
In 1996, Induráin finally was defeated at the Tour de France, placing 11th behind Denmark’s Bjarne Riis. He was going to skip the Olympics, citing fatigue, until a special appeal from IOC President [Juan Antonio Samaranch](/athletes/899318.

Induráin went off last and was ahead of Boardman’s leading splits at all the early marks and won, besting Olano’s time by 12 seconds, with Boardman winning the bronze.

In an exciting and close final, the Canadians managed to edge out the Dutch favorites and capture the gold medal by a margin of less than half a second, despite a discouraging false start.

The German crew included Alfried von Bohlen und Halbach, who was later sentenced to 12 years in prison for “crimes against humanity” during World War II, when he was complicit in assisting Nazi war crimes.

There was no heavier favorite in boxing at the 1992 Olympics. He won his first two matches easily and then faced the United States’ Danell Nicholson in the quarter-finals, and was surprisingly pressed by the little-known American. Nicholson led 8-6 after two rounds, but Savón pulled out the victory in the final round, winning 13-11. Savón then defeated the Netherlands’ Arnold Vanderlijde for the eighth consecutive time, and won the gold medal with an easy decision over Nigeria’s David Izonritei, the 1991 All-Africa Games champion. Vanderlijde came to Barcelona having won the bronze medal at the 1984 and 1988 Olympics in this class, and through 2008 is still the only Olympic boxer to have won three bronze medals. He was European Amateur Champion in 1987, 1989, and 1991.
Savón would return in 1996 and 2000 to win three consecutive gold medals in Olympic boxing, matching the feats of Hungary’s László Papp and his countryman, Teófilo Stevenson. He would also win the world amateur championship again in 1993, 1995, and 1997, to record six consecutive world titles. He took silver in 1999, but only after making the final and having to withdraw when the Cubans withdrew their entire team in protest over some controversial decisions. Savón also won the Pan American Games again in 1995, and added golds at the Central American and Caribbean Games in 1993 and 1998.

She added five other medals at the World Championships, often competing in both the Open Class and either heavyweight or half-heavyweight. For her many titles, Berghmans was an eight-time Belgian female sportsperson of the year during the 1980s, missing only in 1981 and 1987. In Seoul Berghmans won the event fairly easily, taking all matches by ippon, with her longest match taking only 3:01 in her pool final against Japan’s Yoko Tanabe, who was thought to be her biggest challenger. In the final Berghmans defeated Korea’s Bae Mi-Jung, who never again appeared on the podium at a major international, winning by ippon in 2:31. By the time of the 1988 Olympics, Berghmans was somewhat in the twilight of her career, and was helped in Seoul by the absence of Dutchwoman Irene de Kok, who had defeated her in the final of this class at both the 1986 and 1987 World Championships, but was injured and did not compete in Seoul.

The reigning Olympic champion returned in 2018, becoming the only freestyle skier to compete in six editions of the Games and hoping to defend her title. Aerials are often, however, an unpredictable sport, and she faced many viable challengers in her quest for gold. The most consistent of these was probably China’s Xu Mengtao, the runner up in 2014 and the bronze medalist at the last two editions of the World Championships. Ashley Caldwell of the United States was the reigning World Champion, while Australia’s Laura Peel had taken the title in 2015.
The aerials’ unpredictability left Russia’s Aleksandra Orlova as the top qualifier, with Caldwell failing to make the final even after the second qualification round. Orlova’s closest competitor was the relatively unknown Anna Guskova of Belarus, while Xu rounded out the top three. Huskova’s first jump in the final proved that her placing was no fluke, as she came out significantly ahead of the other competitors to take the first round. Xu, who had been behind Huskova, came into the second round determined, but failed to execute her landing properly and was eliminated from the tournament, as was Orlova. Huskova also seemed shaky, however, finishing the round in fourth behind Kong Fanyu and Zhang Xin, both unheralded skiers from China, and Peel. In the end, however, Huskova pulled off the best performance of the finals that, while not flawless, was sufficient to earn her the gold medal and keep the Olympic title in her country’s possession. Her teammate Tsuper, however, attempted to finish with the same jump that had earned her gold four years earlier, but crashed on the landing and was out of the competition. Zhang also performed very well, but was edged out by Huskova and thus settled for silver, while Kong was able take bronze with a safe, but successful jump that placed her ahead of the more challenging, but failed executions of the remainder of the field.

The most recent success for the West Germans, meanwhile, had come in the form of a silver medal at the 1965 European Championships. The other favorite was the Soviet Union who, with various lineups, had won the last three editions of the European Championships and been runner-up at the 1966 World Championships. The Italian team, always a factor, contained two Olympic silver medalists from 1964, Giuseppe Galante and Emilio Trivini, and an Olympic champion from 1956, Romano Sgheiz, who had also taken bronze in 1960.
East Germany dominated the opening round and maintained the fastest time through the semi-finals, although it saw challenges from the Soviets, the Swiss, and the New Zealanders. In the final, however, the New Zealanders took control of the race and, in an unexpected result, beat the East Germans to the top of the podium by over two seconds. East Germany settled for silver while Switzerland underwent a surprising drive and bypassed the Italians to win bronze by a margin of half a second. The victory was the first Olympic rowing title for New Zealand, its first medal since Bob Stiles and Fred Thompson had earned silver in the coxless pairs in 1932, and its third ever (Darcy Hadfield took bronze in the single sculls in 1920).

In the preliminaries, the Spaniards won their heat, but the Germans were surprisingly defeated by an unknown pair of 22-year-olds from Australia, Thomas Green and the South African-born Jean van der Westhuyzen. Van der Westhuyzen grew up idolising Hoff, and even had his picture as his screen saver on his mobile phone.

Australia took the lead right from the start and, after a close-fought race with the German pair, Green and van der Westhuyzen finally claimed a surprise gold medal. The Czech pair of Radek Slouf and Josef Dostal were not only team-mates but were also best friends, and they won the bronze.
It was the first international regatta for Green and van der Westhuyzen as a K-2 combination. Due to the global pandemic situation, and Australia’s tough lockdown laws, the duo trained and prepared only at home for the previous two seasons, not being able to figure on the international canoeing scene. This made their achievement more surprising and remarkable, as they won Australia´s first ever Olympic gold medal in this event.

As the race progressed, wind and snow grew stronger, and ice conditions deteriorated. This placed the skaters who had been drawn late in the competition at a disadvantage. The first favorite to hit the ice was Ivar Ballangrud. The 24-year-old Norwegian was the 1926 World Champion, and had won the 5 km race at the World Championships in Davos just a week ago. He took great advantage of the weather conditions in his race, skating a steady race and lapping his Lithuanian opponent. His time of 8:50.5 was a far cry from the times skated in Davos, where Ballangrud had approached the World Record (which stood at 8:26.5).
Bernt Evensen took off faster than Ballangrud, and had the fastest time until two-thirds of the race, when he faded and finished ten seconds behind his countryman. His time was approached by the best American distance skater, Irving Jaffee of New York. He gained on Evensen every lap, but ended up 0.2 seconds short. 38-year-old Finnish veteran Julius Skutnabb had a similar build up, but won two seconds on the Norwegian in the final lap, moving into silver medal position.
By then, weather conditions had become really tough. Norwegian Armand Carlsen came within half a second of the bronze medal, and would likely have medalled had it not been for the snow. Other favorites finished further back, including two 5000 m medalists from the recent World Championships, Michael Staksrud (NOR) and Clas Thunberg (FIN). Thunberg’s luck was especially bad, considering that he had originally been drawn in the third race. Because his pairmate, the Canadian Gorman, didn’t show up, he was moved to the end of the competition to race Arthur Vollstedt.

On the Australian side, each rower had been to at least one prior Olympics and two, Ben Cureton, who won silver in 2004, and Anthony Edwards, who won silver in 2000 and 2004 and bronze in the double sculls in 1996, had Olympic medals from earlier editions of the Games. The British team was strong as well: three had gold medals in the event from the 2010 World Champions and the fourth, Peter Chambers, had a gold medal from the 2011 World Championships in coxless pairs.
All three of these teams, along with Switzerland, the Netherlands, and South Africa, made it through the heats and the semi-finals. In the finals Denmark shot out to a fair lead and kept it through the first three quarters of the race, but it was obvious that the fight for the podium would go down to the wire, as the Danes never managed to pull completely away from the tight pack of the competition. In the final stretch it looked to be a fight between Britain and Denmark for the gold but an outstanding push from the unheralded South African team caught up and, in the final strokes, outpaced both teams. The South Africans were unaware at first that they had won the race and launched into celebration once they realized their accomplishment. Britain took home a well-earned silver medal and the defending champions Denmark settled for bronze, while the World Champion Australians finished off the podium in fourth.

His biggest challengers were expected to be Canadian Andre De Grasse, the silver medalist behind Bolt in Rio, another American, Kenny Bednarek, and Liberian Joseph Fahnbulleh, who was raised in the United States, competed for the University of Florida, and had won the NCAA title earlier in the year.
All of the favorites made it through to the final, although the second semi-final was absurdly close, with Canada’s Aaron Brown winning in 19.982, with Fahnbulleh second with the same time, and Lyles third in 19.983, meaning he only advanced as a time qualifier. The first semi-final was won by American teenager Erriyon Knighton, while De Grasse led the third semi-final.
In the final De Grasse got out well and led the field coming off the turn, but he was quickly caught by Lyles and Bednarek took a narrow lead at 150 metres. It was De Grasse, however, who was strongest in the last 50 metres and he finished in a Canadian record of 19.62 for the gold medal. Behind him the Americans went 2-3-4, with Bednarek running 19.68 for the silver medal, and Lyles finishing in 19.74 for bronze, as Knighton finished ahead of Fahnbulleh in fourth place.
For De Grasse this was redemption as he had struggled through multiple injuries and sub-par seasons since his Rio exploits. He had missed the 2017 World Championships with hamstring issues, and then re-injured the muscle in 2018, as the year postponement to 2021 aided his recovery.

East Germany defeated its Western counterpart in the opening round to win its heat in an Olympic best time, but the true surprise came when the Netherlands, who had not seen the podium in this event at a major international tournament since the 1964 Olympics, bested the Soviet Union by nearly two and a half seconds. In the semi-finals the East Germans, and then the Soviets, won their heats in Olympic record times, while the Dutch faltered and were eliminated.

Hjalmar Johansson, the eventual gold medalist, realized what had happened and dove in to rescue Cane.  Fortunately, Cane was quickly revived and sustained no major injuries.
In the semi-finals, George Gaidzik (USA), one of the favorites, finished 3rd and did not qualify for the final.  He was actually briefly disqualified, as one of the judges felt he was receiving signals (coaching) from a teammate on the ground.  The judges’s scores for Gaidzik were as follows:  one gave him an 8, a 6, and a 9; one gave him a 9 for each dive; while the third judge scored him 0 for each dive, and disqualified him, based on the above reasoning.  The Americans protested, and after consideration by the judges, the protest was upheld and Gaidzik was advanced as an extra diver to the final.

The two main systems were the German turnverein system promoted originally by Johannes Guts-Muths and Friedrich Ludwig Jahn, and the Swedish system of calisthenics and exercises, which was founded by Pehr Henrik Ling and was much less rigidly formatted. The 1908 team all-around was performed using the Swedish system and it is not surprising that Sweden won the gold medal, nor that their Scandinavian neighbors, Norway and Finland won the silver and bronze medal.

Cain was surprisingly dominant in the final, and won gold nearly a second and a half ahead of Jakobsen, who in turn was almost the same distance ahead of Olaru. The Romanian, meanwhile, had much more difficulty in fending off a challenge from France’s Philippe Renaud, and hung on to third place by a margin of only 0.09 seconds. Cain’s gold medal was Canada’s first in canoeing since Frank Amyot won the C-1 1000 in 1936, and would be followed up by Hugh Fisher and Alwyn Morris the next day in theK-2 1000. Cain and Jakobsen went on to earn medals in the C-1 1000 the following day, although they were demoted to silver and bronze respectively.

János Parti of Hungary, the reigning World Champion and defending Olympic runner-up probably had the strongest claim, but he elected to compete in the C-1 10000 (where he captured silver) and thus his nation was represented by István Hernek, the World C-1 1000 runner-up and C-1 10000 bronze medalist. Czechoslovakia, meanwhile, selected Karel Hradil in their bid to retain Holeček’s titles. Also in contention were Leon Rotman of Romania and Gennady Bukharin of the Soviet Union, who had won gold and bronze respectively in the C-1 10000 the previous day. With only nine entrants, the event went straight to the final, where Rotman became Olympic champion for the second time in the tournament, stealing gold from Hernek by a margin of nearly a second. The Hungarian, therefore, had to settle for silver, while Bukharin also repeated his performance from the C-1 10000 by coming in third, well ahead of Hradil.

Hosszú trailed in fifth and that would be her best finish in any event in Tokyo. Ohashi would return in a few days to win the IM double by taking the 200 IM. Flickinger would later add another bronze medal in the 200 butterfly.

In the final Ryan Murphy opened the backstroke leg for the USA and put them in the lead, but Peaty was swimming the second leg for Great Britain and put them into the lead, as the USA dropped to third, also behind Italy. On the third leg Caeleb Dressel had the event’s fastest butterfly leg, putting the USA back into the lead as Britain’s James Guy could not match his pace and they dropped to second.
The anchor swimmer for the USA was Zach Apple, who had been criticized for a weak leg in the previous 4x2 relay, but he had swum that after a 100 metre freestyle semi-final. Here he redeemed himself with the fastest leg of the competition, narrowly ahead of Australia’s Kyle Chalmers (46.95 – 46.96). Apple’s anchor brought the Americans home for gold, winning in 3:26.78, taking more than a second off the world record they had set at Rio in 2016.
Behind the Americans, Great Britain held on comfortably for silver, with Italy edging out the Russian Olympic Committee team for the bronze medal. For Caeleb Dressel, this was his fifth gold medal of the 2020 Olympics, the dominant male swimming performance at Tokyo.

Nobody could really envision how close, although Sports Illustrated’s Craig Neff did call it, predicting in the Olympic Preview issue, “The West Germans will likely lose their world record and the gold medal to the U.S. – but just barely.” That record went in the heats as the US B team came home in 7:18.87 for a world record to qualify first.
US coach Don Gambril made the choice to lead off with America’s best, Mike Heath, and make the Germans catch up, as the German anchor would certainly be Michael Groß, probably the top male freestyler in Los Angeles. On the first leg Heath went ahead of Thomas Fahrner, 1:48.67 to 1:49.83. On the next leg David Larson extended the lead to 2.87 seconds at 300 metres, but he had gone out too fast, and Dirk Korthals closed so that the US lead was only 9/10ths of a second by the exchange. The third US swimmer, Jeff Float, also went out quickly and had 3 seconds on the Germans at 500 metres, but Alexander Schowtka reeled in Float on the second 100, with the margin 1.56 seconds as the anchor swimmers started their work.
Groß anchored Germany, as expected, and he faced off against American Bruce Hayes. At the first turn of the anchor, Groß had caught up, but Gambril later noted that “Groß paid too much to catch Bruce that early.” For the next 100 they swam together, Groß unable to shake Hayes, until Germany took a slight lead at the final turn. With 25 metres to go, Hayes had made that up and they swam together to the wall, nobody really knowing who had won, until the scoreboard showed that it was the United States – 7:15.69 to 7:15.73 – the closest relay in Olympic swimming history. The time was a world record by over three seconds.
Groß was magnanimous in defeat, stating, “I simply did not have any more to give. We never expected to swim so fast in the relay, so we cannot be too disappointed.” His final leg of 1:46.89 was the fastest 200 split ever recorded at that time.

Sautin led after the qualifying and semi-finals, and kept increasing his lead, eventually winning gold by almost 30 points over German Jan Hempel.

It was equalled by Dolgopyat, however, who had a few landings that were less than perfect, and he incurred a 0.1 penalty for landing out of the area on one of them. Because he had a marginally better D score, 6.600 to 6.500, than Zapata, after both men had identical E scores (8.433), Dolgopyat was in the lead. He had to wait while four more gymnasts took to the floor, including China’s Xiao Ruoteng, the individual all-round silver medalist, before he knew if he had won the gold medal. Fortunately for him, Ruoteng’s 14.766 put him in third place, which meant the Israeli took the gold medal and the Spanish the silver.

In the 2018 season, all three World Cup races had been won by the Japanese ladies. While the Dutch only raced with their A-team on one occasion, the Japanese went all out and lowered the world record on each of these three occasions, improving it by a total of 5 seconds.
The quarterfinals confirmed expectations, with Netherlands setting the fastest time (a new Olympic record), closely followed by Japan. The other nations were at least 3 seconds slower, with the North American teams of Canada and the US making the cut. The host nation, Korea, placed seventh, but their performance gained lots of attention. One of the skaters, No Seon-Yeong was unable to follow the pace and fell back. In the post-race press conference, the other two skaters, who hadn’t noticed No falling behind, blamed her (and other external factors) for the team’s failure. The Korean public didn’t accept this “bullying” of No, who had hoped to win a medal in Pyeongchang in honor of her deceased brother No Jin-Gyu, a former short track world champion. A petition was set up for the South Korean government to remove Kim Bo-Reum and Park Ji-Wu from the team. The petition received half a million signatures, well above the limit that warrants an official response. After an apology, all three skaters appeared on the ice again in the consolation round.
In the semi-finals, the Americans didn’t even try to beat the Dutch, instead opting to save energy for the bronze medal race. Japan also had an easy semi, setting up the expected final. The concluding race was a close affair, with the teams switching leads. In the final laps, the Japanese pulled away to win the event for the first time. The level of competition was high: Japan recorded the second fastest time ever, and the Dutch recorded a national record, slightly below what had been the world record until the beginning of the season. In the bronze medal match, the Americans saw their semi-final strategy prove fruitful. Short-distance specialists Brittany Bowe and Heather Bergsma both faded towards the end of their race, but they had gained sufficient advantage to hold on to the bronze.

The Chinese dominance in this event was looking shaky from early on when You Hao stumbled on his rings landing, and then more mistakes followed before You gave an outstanding performance on the parallel bars, scoring 16.166, the best of the competition, to bring China back into contention and chase Russia and Japan for the medal places, with Great Britain not far behind after ranking first on the pommel horse thanks to a 15.991 score from Max Whitlock. Going into the sixth and final rotation, Japan headed Russia by just 0.208 of a point and the two went head-to-head on the floor. Thanks to a 16.133 from Kenzo Shirai and a score of 15.600 from Uchimura, Japan secured the gold medal, ahead of the Russians with China in third and Great Britain closely behind in fourth. It was a disappointing competition for the United States, who were one of the fancied teams, but they too were struck by a series of errors which cost them and they had to settle for fifth place. It was the first time China had won a bronze medal; previously they had won only either gold or silver.

Santos crumbled in race 11, finishing 17th and dropped off the podium completely. Nikos also struggled, finishing only 10th and the gold medal went to Fridman, who finished second in the final race. This was the first ever gold medal by any Israeli athlete at the Olympics, although Fridman had also won a bronze in this class at the 1996 Olympics.

In the meantime, Agbegnenou not only ousted Trstenjak from the top of the ranking list but also won all four world titles since the last Olympics to become the dominant fighter in the half-middleweight class. Already a legend, she took her first Olympic gold as expected in Tokyo. The final, however, was not an easy task and she had to go into overtime to defeat Trstenjak with Waza-ari (half point) for the Golden Score after 4:37 min. Both finallists did not sail through the previous rounds too smoothly, with Trstenjak having to sustain one more bout, eliminating not only third seed Anriquelis Barrios but also the eventual bronze medallist Maria Centracchio. Agbegnenou’s strongest opponent on the way into the final was fourth seed Pan-American Champion Catherine Beauchemin-Pinard from Canada. The Québécois lost by a Waza-ari, the only score by either of the fighters. Eventually Beauchemin-Pinard was compensated scoring a Waza-ari in extra time against Barrios to win the bronze medal contest. One of the few surprise judo medallists was 12th seed Maria Centracchio from Italy. With a bit of luck in the quarter-final draw, she faced Agata Ozdoba-Blach from Poland who received three Shidos (penalties) compared to Centracchio’s two. And in her bronze medal match, again her opponent, Juul Franssen from The Netherlands, collected three Shidos for a defeat.

His teammate, Wolfgang Schwarz, had made a habit of placing second to Danzer, having done so at every major and national competition since 1966. The American team had rebounded slightly from the 1961 plane crash that had killed the entire team. Two Americans had been on the podium at the last three World Championships – Gary Visconti and Tim Wood. At Grenoble, Danzer stumbled badly in the compulsory figures, placing only fourth. Schwarz took the lead, followed by Wood, and then France’s Patrick Pera. The competition for the three medals would be very close. Danzer came back to win the free skate but it could not lift him ahead of Schwarz or Wood. Schwarz placed second in the free skate and defeated Wood for the gold medal, five majority firsts to four. Pera placed only seventh in the free skate, but his compulsory lead over Danzer enabled him to win the bronze medal, with five majority thirds to four for Danzer.
Schwarz never won another major championship, including a national title, as he turned professional and skated for a few years with Holiday on Ice. Years later he fell afoul of the law, being arrested in both 2002 and 2005 for running a human smuggling operation to recruit women to work as prostitutes in Austria. The 11th place finisher in the event, Günter Zöller of East Germany, defected to West Germany in 1972 just before the European Championships. The other GDR skater, Jan Hoffmann, placed only 26th, but at 12-years-old, he was the youngest male competitor ever at the Olympic Winter Games.

Also expected to challenge for the medals were Grenadian Kirani James, the 2012 London gold medalist and 2011 World Champion, and the 2018 Commonwealth Games Champion, Isaac Makwala of Botswana.
All of the favorites save for van Niekerk made it to the final, where they were joined by another top American, Michael Cherry. James had been especially impressive in winning his semi-final in 43.88, as Gardiner led the third semi-final over Norman and Makwala, with van Niekerk trailing and not qualifying.
In the final James and Norman were out fastest with James holding a narrow lead at the halfway mark, as Gardiner was a good three metres back. At 300 metres, James still led but Gardiner had closed on the final turn and was close. Gardiner passed James on the straight to win the gold medal, as James was also passed by the Colombian Anthony Zambrano, who had been a silver medalist at the 2017 World Championships. Cherry finished fourth and Norman fifth as no Americans won a medal, unusual for the event, and Makwala was never a factor, placing seventh.
Gardiner won the first athletics gold medal for the Bahamas. For James, it was his third consecutive Olympics on the podium, completing his set of Olympic medals, after gold in 2012, and silver in 2016.

Belgium’s Jos Vissers won the European Championships in 1947 whilst the wiry Dane, Svend Vad , had won the bronze medal. Ireland’s Maxie McCullagh was also reckoned to be a prospect for honours.
All the major challengers reached the quarter-finals where Wad had the better of McCullagh and Visser struggled before edging Canada’s Haddad in a contest which many thought the Canadian deserved to win. Bud Smith had been the most impressive fighter in the tournament but a much improved Visser edged their semi-final and was joined in the final by the South African teenager, Gerard Dreyer. Dreyer had surprised Wad in the semi-final and continued to impress in the final. Visser played the aggressor but Dreyer’s solid defence held sway until a momentary lapse from the Belgian left him open to a left hook. Although Visser recovered from the second round knockdown, the course of the fight was decided and Dreyer took the gold for South Africa.
Bud Smith became world lightweight champion in 1955 and held the title for over a year. He retired with a career record of 31 wins from 60 fights although a run of 11 losses at the end of his career distorts that record slightly. Smith was shot and killed in 1973 whilst in conversation with a woman who was the intended target of the gunman. Dreyer and Vad also enjoyed success as professionals but not to the same extent as Smith.

Two of the three East German women, Ortrun Enderlein and Anna-Maria Müller were leading after three runs (the fourth was eventually cancelled) when they were disqualified for heating the runners of their sleds. This practice gives lugers an advantage, as the warm runners melt the ice of the track, resulting in less friction when going downhill. At luge’s Olympic debut in 1964, heating of the runners was commonly practiced by nearly all competitors, but the International Luge Federation (FIL) had since forbidden this. At competitions, a technical delegate of FIL checked the sleds, measuring temperature of the runners by hand. However, after the first two runs, there were persistent rumours that the East Germans were nevertheless warming their material. This prompted the chief of the Jury, Poland’s Lucian Świderski, to test the runners himself. Witnessed by team leaders of Austria and Italy, he concluded that the three East Germans, who were in positions 1, 2 and 4 after three runs, had heated their runners, and were to be disqualified.

Their most serious rivals in the Cortina Olympics were supposed to be the Finns, their best being Paavo Korhonen and Eeti Nieminen.
In the opening ski jumping event Stenersen made his countrymen shaky with a bad first jump, placing him on a very modest 19th place after the first round. A totally unknown Soviet skier, Yury Moshkin, surprised everybody by taking a clear lead. In the second round, Moshkin fell after the longest jump of the day (79.5 m), but Stenersen regained confidence after achieving the highest point score of the round. In the third round Stenersen again mad a solid jump, but could not prevent Moshkin from winning the jumping competition with Stenersen and the 25 year old Swede Bengt Eriksson following closely as 2nd and 3rd. The other Norwegians, placing 10-15-26 seemed out of the medal contention, like Korhonen, placing 17.
The cross country event, now competed 2 days after the ski jumping and with the length reduced from 18 to 15 km, was for the first time in Olympic history organized as a separate event, not as earlier integrated with the specialist’s race. It turned out to be the race of the life for Stenersen, and to everybody’s surprise the jumping specialist won the event 14 second ahead of Korhonen. Moshkin appeared to be no match at all, he was beaten by Stenersen by 8 minutes and fell down to 13th place in the final standing. Stenersen won with a large margin, but the struggle for the other medals was very close. Eriksson, later nicknamed “Silver-Bengt” for his Olympic achievement, held on for silver, and another great surprise, the 24-year old Pole Franciszek Gąsienica Groń was able to snatch the bronze medal ahead of Korhonen. Four nations finished among the first four in the final standing, something totally new in this event.

At the recent World Championships, the distance had been won by Lidiya Skoblikova (URS-1960), Eevi Huttunen (FIN-1959), and Inga Artamanova (URS-1958). Skoblikova had already won the 1,500 metres in Squaw Valley. The other two Soviet skaters in the event, who had to be considered as no non-Soviet woman had been on the all-around podium at the World Championships since 1952, were Tamara Rylova and Valentina Stenina, wife of top men’s skater, Boris Stenin. Stenina had recently won the 1960 World Championships in all-around, and had been second at this distance.
Twenty skaters came to the mark. Rylova was in the third pair and took the lead, but her time of 5:30.0 would place her only ninth. The next favorite to skate was Stenina in the seventh pair. Her time of 5:16.9 was considered fast, and put her into a comfortable lead. Huttunen was up two pairs later, and although she was ahead of Stenina’s pace through 2,200 metres, she struggled on the final laps, finishing in 5:21.0. Skoblikova was in the last pair, the 10th, but the day was cold, and the ice was still good. She led throughout, finishing in 5:14.3, the second fastest time ever. It was her second gold medal of the 1960 Winter Olympics, and four years later in Innsbruck, she would win all four women’s races.

They left Hans Bernhardt and Karl Köther far behind on the second try, but eased going into the last lap, and then had to fight hard for the victory, about half a wheel ahead of Germany. In the final, the Dutch pair faced Ernest Chambers and John Sibbitt of Britain. In the first curve of the last lap, the Dutch jumped to the lead, and cut in front of their opponents on the back straight. They held on to the lead until the line. Some onlookers thought their move to overtake had been illegal, but the result was allowed to stand. Not so lucky were the Canadian tandem sprinters. They were set to compete in the first round, but their tandem bike, which had been used in the first heat of the competition as well, was broken, and had not yet been repaired. Canada had to forfeit, and Italy received a walkover to the semi-finals.

The final score of the top seven consisted of their total score in both rounds. The program consisted of 33 movements. West German Josef Neckermann had a seemingly insurmountable lead after the preliminary round, 40 points ahead of Soviet Ivan Kizimov, but when Neckermann opened the final round, there was some noise in the audience and his mount, Mariano, became nervous and rode poorly. They would place last in the final and drop back to second, with Kizimov having by far the best final round to win the gold medal. Neckermann’s teammate Reiner Klimke won the bronze medal. Klimke would repeat as bronze medalist in 1976 and win gold in this event in 1984. In his Olympic dressage career from 1960-88, he won eight medals, with six golds, five in the team event. Neckermann competed at the Olympics from 1960-72, winning six medals, two of each color. He is considered to have been one of the wealthiest private citizen Olympians ever.
