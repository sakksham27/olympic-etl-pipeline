76,Roper Barrett,Male,24 November 1873,,, Great Britain,GBR,"Roper Barrett learned his tennis at Merchant Taylor’s School and the Forest Gate Club and was able to devote a great deal of time to the game. He won the Belgian Open singles title for four successive years from 1900, the Austrian title in 1904 and a vast number of tournaments at home. He was most successful in the Suffolk Championships at Saxmundham which he won no less than 17 times between 1898 and 1921. Barrett also reached the final of the All-comers singles at Wimbledon four times, going through to the Challenge Round in 1911 when he was forced to retire against Tony Wilding with the score level at two sets all. Despite these considerable successes, Roper Barett must, in retrospect, be considered as a better doubles player. With his Olympic partner, Arthur “Wentworth” Gore, they made up one of the more formidable doubles combinations of their era, winning Wimbledon in 1909 and reaching the All-Comers final on three other occasions. They won the Olympic covered court title in 1908 and the following year took the British indoor title. Barrett and Gore went to Stockholm in 1912 to defend their Olympic indoor crown but after winning the first two sets were beaten by a Swedish pair in the semi-finals. Barrett, however, had the consolation of winning a silver medal in the mixed doubles with Helen Aitchison as his partner. Apart from his win at Wimbledon with Gore in 1909, Barrett was also successful in 1912 and 1913 when he was partnered with Charles Dixon, who, like Barrett, was a solicitor by profession. Additionally, he won the covered court mixed doubles in 1910 with Mrs. O’Neill. Roper Barrett played in the first Davis cup match at Boston in 1900 with his last appearance coming in 1919. Although he did not have a particularly distinguished playing record in Cup matches he did, as non-playing captain, lead the British team to four consecutive victories in the thirties. Barrett served as Chairman of the Lawn Tennis Association in 1924 and was active in civic affairs, being twice Master of the Worshipful Company of Farriers and Chief Commoner of the City of London in 1924. He was also a keen footballer, playing regularly for Corinthians Casuals at Weybridge.",

At the 1994 Winter Olympic ice hockey tournament Norris skated in eight matches, scored two goals, and took home a silver medal. He spent nearly the entire 1994-1995 season with the Aces and managed to get on the ice only thirteen times with the Nordiques. His situation did not improve when he joined the NHL’s Mighty Ducks of Anaheim in 1995, suiting up for three games with the team that year and fourteen with the International Hockey League’s Los Angeles Ice Dogs.

In the former case she won gold, silver, and bronze in the 500 m, 1,000 m, and 3,000 m relay events respectively at the 2005 World Junior Championships. In the latter division she took home a gold medal from the World Championships in the 3,000 m relay. She qualified for the 500 m and 3,000 m relay events at the 2006 Winter Olympics despite sustaining a leg injury at the trials, and was the youngest member of the national team. Nevertheless she did well at the tournament, placing fourth in the 500 m competition and taking home a silver medal in the relay. Her success increased at that year’s World Championships, where she earned bronze in the 500 m and 1,000 m events, in addition to silver in the 3,000 m relay. The following season was marked by continued national and World Cup successes alongside gold in the 500 m competition and bronze in the 3,000 m relay at the 2007 World Championships. One of her most well-known moments came at that year’s Montreal World Cup during the relay when skaters from Korea and China, significantly ahead of Italy and Canada who were racing for third place, fell. With their bodies lying across the ice, Roberge was forced to leap over them to avoid going down herself, and Canada eventually won the gold. She continued strong in 2008, hitting an unofficial world record in the semifinals of a 1,000 m event, and took one silver (in the 3,000 m relay) and two bronze (in the 500 m and 1,000 m events) medals at the World Championships.

Although he used the name Fernando Cicarelli for his athletic career, legal documents show that his real surname was Chacarelli. Additionally, several samples of his autograph exist and are signed “Fernando Chacarelli”. His first major international tournament was the 1926 South American Championships in Athletics, where he placed third in the 3,000 and 5,000m distances, and then improved to second place in the 3,000 at the 1927 edition. He also finished second in the 5,000m that year, but was disqualified for allegedly elbowing the bronze medalist during the race. Disappointed at the decision, he dropped out of the cross-country event that was to be held the following day. He was then selected to participate at the 1928 Summer Olympics, but the Argentinian Olympic Committee decided not to sponsor long-distance runners at the Games and Chacarelli was unable to attend. Chacarelli’s next stop was the 1929 South American Championships where, focusing on longer distances, he finished second in the 10,000m and third in the cross-country race. At the 1931 edition he was crowned champion in the cross-country, which was to be his only international title. He set new South American records at the 15, 20, and 25 km distances in 1932, paving the way for him to attend that year’s Summer Olympics, where he placed 12th in a field of 16 competitors in the 10,000 m and 17th among 28 participants in the marathon.

In 1931, he again crossed the line first, beating Denmark’s Willy Falck Hansen, the 1928 Olympic champion. But the judge had erroneously announced Hansen to be the winner, and the rules didn’t allow for announced results to be changed, which cost Michard his fifth world title.

From 1900 he started teaching at the Birmingham Municipal School of Art and also designed works for the famous London store Liberty. By 1910 he was the head of metalwork at the Birmingham School of Art and he retained that position until 1942 when he reached retirement age but he continued to work as a silversmith up to the time of his death. In September 1902 he obtained his own mark at the Birmingham Assay Office. Many beautiful examples of his work from his workshop at Bournville, Birmingham remain today. His works extended from ceremonial and Churchplate work to simple silver and gold jewellery. But whether requiring the greatest of skill and technique, or the simplest of skills, Cuzner carried them out to the highest standard and many if his designs centred around the beauty of nature; flowers, birds and grasses. He also designed the King’s Vase that was presented to the winner of the race of the same name at the 1935 Royal Ascot Meeting. The Culzner Trophy for House Football at King’s Norton Grammar School is named after him after he designed and presented the trophy to the school as a way of saying thank you to them for educating his son John who left the school in 1935. Bernard Cuzner wrote many books including A Silversmith’s Manual, written in the early1920’s and reprinted in 1993. A lot of his published works we reprinted long after his death. His Olympic entry in the 1948 Painting, Applied Arts category was entitled Silver Symbolic Torch and his work received an Honorary Mention. It was later commissioned by the Worshipful Company of Goldsmiths, one of the major guilds, and subsequently made by his Olympic student Stanley Morris and engraved by William Biddle. It went on display at the Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge in 1950 during an exhibition sponsored by the Worshipful Company of Goldsmiths. At around 46 cm, the torch is significantly smaller than the one actually used for the torch relay. It appears on the cover of the 1949 edition of Cuzner’s book A Silversmith’s Manual.",

Before that, he had to compete in Nordic combined on the national level. After his Olympic victory in 1924, Thams won the Holmenkollen ski jumping part of Nordic Combined four years in a row (1924-27), winning the so-called Ladies’ Cup, but as a mediocre cross-country skier his best placing in the Holmenkollen Nordic Combined was a modest 14th in 1924. After winning the 1926 World Ski Jumping Championship, he was favored to defend his gold medal at the 1928 Winter Olympics. Thams was third after the first jump behind his countrymen Alf Andersen and Sigmund Ruud. The Swiss home favorites demanded more speed in the inrun for the second round. After strong discussions the Swiss jumpers got their will, and the hot-tempered Thams, provoked by the Swiss skiers, who accused the Norwegians of cowardness, instead of making a safe jump for a medal, gave all he had and landed at 73 meters, almost 10 meters longer than any other jump in the competition. But he fell, as he had no chance to remain standing at that length, and ended as 28th in the final results. After his skiing career he competed in sailing, and was a member of the Norwegian team in the 8-metre class that won the silver medal at Berlin in 1936. He then became the second athlete with medals from Summer and Winter Games, with American Eddie Eagan being the first with gold medals in boxing in 1920 and bobsleigh in 1932.

6473,Christian Laettner,Male,17 August 1969,211.0,107, United States,USA,"Christian Laettner hit the most famous shot in the history of college basketball. A 6-11 (211 cm) power forward / center, Laettner played at Duke University, where he led them to the Final Four all four years of his college career. He also helped them win the NCAA title in both 1991-92, the first college team to repeat as champions since the 1970 heyday of the UCLA Bruins. After winning the 1991 NCAA title, Duke was favored to repeat in 1992 and was ranked #1 most of the year. In the Elite Eight, they played a tough Kentucky team and the game went into overtime. Trailing 101-100, Kentucky forward Sean Woods hit a shot in the lane to put Kentucky ahead 102-101 and seemingly win the game for the Wildcats, as only 2.1 seconds remained. Duke called time-out, however, and on the inbounds play, Grant Hill threw a near court-length pass to Laettner, who caught it at the top of the key, dribbled twice, turned, and hit an 18-foot turn-around jumper as time expired, giving the Blue Devils the victory, 103-102. The game is usually considered the greatest ever in college basketball, and Laettner’s shot has been re-run on television numerous times since 1992. Laettern was the only collegian chosen for the original US basketball Dream Team that dominated the opposition at the 1992 Barcelona Olympics. That, his college success, and his clutch shots, led one basketball writer to dub him one of the two luckiest people to ever live, “along with Ringo Starr.” After the Olympics, Laettner joined the Minnesota Timberwolves of the NBA, playing with them from 1992-96. He later played for the Atlanta Hawks (1996-99), Detroit Pistons (1999-2000), Dallas Mavericks (2000-01), Washington Wizards (2001-04), and Miami Heat (2004-05). Laettner had a solid NBA career, making the All-Rookie team in 1993, and the 1997 All-Star Game. He finished with career averages of 12.8 points and 6.7 rebounds per game. Laettner was an aggressive, some said dirty, player, who was not always well-liked. In fact, in 2015, ESPN produced a 30-for-30 documentary entitled “I Hate Christian Laettner.” Laettner also ran into trouble later in life with investments in Durham, NC, where he went to college. He and college teammate Brian Davis started Blue Devil Ventures (BDV), which attempted to revitalize downtown Durham. It would eventually become very successful, but not initially and Laettner and Davis lost significant amounts of money, which led several investors to sue them.",Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the Summer Pan American Games (0–0–1 1991 La Habana BAS bronze) Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the Basketball World Cup (0–0–1 1990 ARG bronze)

He was regarded as one of the finest 20th century engravers and was the leading exponent of diamond-point engraving. Wilson became chief designer of Whitefriars in 1948 and was later managing director, a post he held until he retired at the end of 1972. Wilson was responsible for designing many pieces for Royal occasions since 1935, including the Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II in 1953, her marriage to Prince Phillip in 1947, and the investiture of King Charles III as Prince of Wales in 1969. One of Wilson’s other famous works was in designing and engraving the cut glass casket used to house the scroll given to recipients of the Freedom of Harrow. The first one was designed for Winston Churchill when he was the inaugural recipient to be so honored in 1955. The following year Wilson designed and engraved a goblet for the Royal Air Force (RAF), which contained their insignia and Churchill’s memorable speech: “Never in the field of human conflict was so much owed by so many to so few,” in reference to the RAF fighter pilots and bomber crews who kept control of the skies over Britain during World War II.",

This was discovered in 1996 by US inspectors. In 1999, Feron and five of his employees were charged with violating the US Clean Water Act. Rather than face trial, possible prison time up to five years and up to $250,000 in fines, Feron fled the country.

After the war he served a short jail term due to his fascist collaboration. His later work was with organic building forms and ideas, presenting extreme ideas of neo-classicism. Moretti was widely considered the most important Italian architect of the 20th century. He produced a massive body of work in the years 1930-1973 in Italy and further afield. He also founded the magazine Spazio to illustrate the informative art and their relation to architecture. Best known to Americans is surely his 1961 Watergate Complex in Washington, DC. For the 1960 Roma Olympics he designed the Olympic Village for the athletes. Luigi Moretti was born the son of an Italian and a Belgian architect, who left the family early. Luigi studied in Roma and is today considered one of the most important Italian architects of the 20th century. He developed a clear inclination for the neoclassical monumental architecture of the Fascists. He is said to have spent the years 1942-45 in the hospital for unknown reasons. In 1945, he was briefly arrested for his role in Fascism. After World War II, he founded the periodical Spezia, which dealt with the connection between art and architecture. He later worked with organic designs, which he used however rather formally. In Milano and Roma he succeeded in the realization of significant projects of residential and commercial buildings (including the Olympic Village for the athletes 1960). In the US, he designed the later infamous Watergate complex in Washington. In 1936 he was commissioned to expand Enrico del Debbio’s master plan of the Forum Mussolini. This plan has never been completely realized. However, the fencing academy designed by him, “Accademia di scherma del Foro Mussolini” or “Casa delle Armi”, built 1934-36, was one of his most important buildings. The short side facing the Tiber is divided into two parts: one without a window and the other with a horizontal window screen. In the second part was the actual fencing room, 45 meters long and 25 meters wide, in which 160 athletes could train at the same time. The facades were uniformly clad in white Carrara marble. In the 1980s, the building was a high-security court and in 2005 returned to the Italian NOK. The planned “sports center in Caserta” was probably not realized.",

His name was given to the figure skating jump “Salchow” that he performed for the first time in 1909. He was a specialist of the now defunct compulsories, which accounted for a large percentage of the total marks. Salchow won 10 World Championships, 1901-05 and 1907-11. He did not compete in the 1906 World Championships that were held in Munich, as he feared that he would not be judged fairly against Gilbert Fuchs of Germany. His 10 titles are still a record, which he shares with Sonja Henie and Irina Rodnina. When figure skating was first contested at the Summer Olympics in London in 1908, Salchow won the title with ease. In addition, Salchow won the European Championships a record nine times (1898-1900, 1904, 1906-07, 1909-10, 1913), placed second in the World Championships three times (1897, 1899-1900) and once at the European Championships (1901). In his early career he was Swedish national champion in 1895-97. In 1976, he was inducted into the Figure Skating World Hall of Fame. Salchow could not defend his Olympic gold medal at Stockholm in 1912 because organizers opted out of holding skating contests. When he made one last attempt at the Olympics in 1920, it ended in a fall, ironically while attempting his own jump, the Salchow. Despite this, the then 42-year-old managed to place fourth. In 1906, he published a handbook of skating, which was translated into several languages. He was also active in other sports, including cycling and bobsledding. After his active career Salchow was President of the International Skating Union from 1925-37 and Chairman of the AIK in Stockholm from 1928-39. He was also chairman of the Swedish Cycling Association (1904-07), Swedish Skating Association (1917-20, 1923-32, 1935-38), and helped to found the Swedish Boxing Federation, where he was chairman from 1919-32, and he was a member of the board of the National Sports Confederation (1911-28). Salchow was an active yachtsman and worked for the Swedish newspaper Dagens Nyheter and Associated Press as a journalist. He was on the board of the Swedish Radio and a successful merchant and radio pioneer.",Listed in Olympians and IOC Members Serving as President of an International Federation (IF) (ISU president 1925-1937) Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the European Figure Skating Championships (9–0–1 1898 Trondheim gold: singles; 1899 Davos gold: singles; 1900 Berlin gold: singles; 1901 Wien bronze: singles; 1904 Davos gold: singles; 1906 Davos gold: singles; 1907 Berlin gold: singles; 1909 Budapest gold: singles; 1910 Berlin gold: singles; 1913 Oslo gold: singles) Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the World Figure Skating Championships (10–3–0 1897 Stockholm silver: singles; 1899 Davos silver: singles; 1900 Davos silver: singles; 1901 Stockholm gold: singles; 1902 London gold: singles; 1903 St. Petersburg gold: singles; 1904 Berlin gold: singles; 1905 Stockholm gold: singles; 1907 Wien gold: singles; 1908 Troppau gold: singles; 1909 Stockholm gold: singles; 1910 Davos gold: singles; 1911 Berlin gold: singles)

She was captain of the Italian national team at the 2002 World Championships in Germany, coached by Marco Bonitta. She was among the best middle-blockers in the world and her technical and physical talent, with pluck and charisma, made her among the most well-known figures in women’s volleyball between 1990s and 2000s. Leggeri débuted in the First League at the age of 16, in 1992, with Fincres Roma. She then moved to Altamura, Virtus Reggio Calabria, Spezzano Rubiera, Centro Ester Napoli, Volley Modena, Giannino Pieralisi Volley Jesi, and Club Padova e Imola. In the 2008-09 season she joined Sassuolo, and then Sirio Perugia, River Piacenza, and finally Millenium Brescia in the Third League in 2015-2016, where she won the Italian Cup in this category and promotion to the Second League. Among her palmarés are three Italian titles (Modena, 2000; River Piacenza 2013 and 2014); one European Cup (Modena, 2001); three CEV Cups (Roma 1993, Napoli 1999 and Modena 2002); three Italian Cups (Modena, 2002; River Piacenza 2013 and 2014); and two Italian SuperCups (River Piacenza, 2013 and 2014).

She soon became an irreplaceable mainstay of the Azzurro sextet: she earned 326 international caps, one more than Manuela Benelli and behind only fellow Olympians Simona Rinieri Dennis, Francesca Piccinini and Eleonora Lo Bianco. For over four years Leggeri was captain of the team. In addition to the world title, she made two Olympic appearances and twice took the gold medal at the Mediterranean Games (1997 and 2001), as well as the silver medals at the 2001 Europeans and 2004 Gran Prix.

He crossed the Irish Sea to play with Belfast Cliftonville in 1908 when just 18 and then, in January 1909, went to northern Europe to play in Sweden before returning to Britain in 1910. He moved to Southport where he spent two seasons with Southport Central (now Southport FC) in the Lancashire Combination. He joined Woolwich Arsenal (now just Arsenal) in February 1912 when his work took him to Gravesend and he agreed to help out as an amateur when he could. A centre-forward, who could also play at centre-half, he made his Gunners début against Preston North End on 8 April 1912. Grant played four games for the Arsenal and scored three goals, all in the 5-1 win over Blackburn Rovers on 22 April 1912. Rovers were top of the first division at the time. James Wylie’s father, James, Sr., was a former director of Woolwich Arsenal. Grant was chosen as one of the non-travelling reserves for the Great Britain squad at the 1912 Olympics in Sweden, where he had previously played League football. Less than a month after the Olympic final, Grant turned professional and was off to Europe again, this time to join former Arsenal colleague Willy Garbutt, who had been appointed the first professional coach of the Italian club Genoa. Grant was one of five Englishmen recruited by Garbutt and he turned out to be a prolific goalscorer for the Italian outfit. He spent three seasons at Genoa and was part of their Italian championship-winning team in 1914-15. He returned to England at the end of that season and got married to his sweetheart Kathleen Shortt at Birkdale, Southport, in July 1915. He finished his football career with the Northern Nomads.",

1005172,Byrd Mock,Female,23 February 1876,,, United States,USA,"Byrd Mock was multi-talented. She was mainly a journalist and author but was also successful as a songwriter. Living in Los Angeles in 1932, she experienced the Olympic Games there. In 1936, Avery Brundage, then President of the American Olympic Committee, was presented with the Olympic Ode (full title: The Olympic Games: Past, Present, and Future, A Pindaric Ode) written by Byrd Mock and illustrated by the American artist, Charles Sindelar. Brundage later presented it to the IOC for the Olympic Museum in Lausanne. Mock was awarded a diploma by the American Press Association for proficiency in journalism, and she later worked as the chair of Greek and Latin at Forest Park University and did feature work for St. Louis newspapers, with most of her stories making the front pages, including Time magazine. Frequently she reported from the Indian territories. Under the pseudonym “Le Moqueur” she also published poetry. Miss Byrd Mock was the founder and executive secretary of the American Women’s Legion. She was also inducted into the Arkansas Golf Hall of Fame in 1999 for having designed the first golf course in Arkansas (in Fayetteville). In her early years she studied at the University of Arkansas at Lafayette and was a member of the University Orchestra, playing first violin. As an exhibit in the painting section, the Olympic Ode should have been listed under the name of illustrator Charles James Sindelar (1875-1947). He first became known for his cover sheets for menu cards for dinners with notable personalities. Beginning in the 1930s, he worked primarily for the “I AM” activities of the Saint Germain movement, which invoked divine revelations dating back to 1930. In 1940, Sindelar was one of the defendants in a fraud trial, but he was acquitted. The group had claimed, for instance, that Jesus had personally posed for his portrait of Sindelar and that he was the reincarnation of Leonardo da Vinci. The following note reads in American newspapers in January 1936: “When the United States liner Manhattan sailed Friday with the American teams scheduled to take part in the Winter Olympics in the Bavarian Alps, the American Olympic Association placed in charge of Dr. Joel H. Hildebrand of the University of California, coach and manager of the skiing team, the official Olympic Ode, The Olympic Games, Past, Present and Future, written by Byrd Mock and hand-illuminated by Charles Sindelar, painter. This manuscript was valued at 5,000 US dollars, requested by the President of the International Olympic Committee, Count Henri de Baillet-Latour, to be placed permanently in the Olympic Museum in Lausanne. He arranged for its publication in the Official Bulletin of the Olympic Games. The ode will be exhibited in the Olympic Art Exhibition. It is set in an olive wood frame from the site of the ancient Olympic Games in Greece. The manuscript with its frame measures about a yard square. The ode is translated into more than 50 languages. Written in the manner of Pindar, who celebrated the ancient Olympics in verse in 500 B.C., the ode earned its author a place in the London publication Most Important Poets of the World.”",

As of 2011, she is still active, having won her first national title in 1979. Originally a skier (both alpine and cross-country), Longo has won all available titles in the sport. She has been world champion 13 times, five times in the road race (1985-87, 1989, 1995), four times in the time trial (1995-197, 2001), three times in the individual pursuit (1986, 1988-89) on the track, and once in the track’s points race (1989). In 1993 she also medalled at the World Championships in mountainbiking, finishing second in the cross-country. Jeannie Longo is the winner of four Olympic medals, including a gold medal in the road race of 1996 after four failed attempts as a favorite. Longo has competed in Olympic cycling all seven times the sport has been held for women (1984-2008). She has won the Grande Boucle three times in a row (1987-89) and has 24 French titles to her name, her latest as recent as 2010. Longo has also broken the world hour record a total of six times. Longo has retired, or been assumed to retire, several times, but except for a break between 1989-91 has always continued racing, often against competitors who were not even born when she won her first titles. Despite her successes, Longo is not very popular in the peloton, due to her competitiveness and preference to make her own decisions in preparation and during the race.","Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the Summer Universiade (0–1–1 1983 Edmonton CYC silver: 3000 m individual pursuit, bronze: road race) Listed in Olympic Cycling and World Professional Road Champions (Olympic Gold – 1996 Road Race; 1985-87, 1989, 1995 World Professional Road race Champion; 1995-97, 2001 World Professional Road Time Trial Champion.)"

When she was aged 10, Wood and her family came to England and the youngster went to school in Eastbourne, where her first tennis coach was Clay Iles. Wood went on to become the British number one and was national champion three times in 1988-89 and 1995. Wood played on the WTA Tour between 1984 and 1998 and enjoyed just one ITF singles win when she beat Spain’s María José Llorca at Lisbon in 1986. In addition, Wood captured six ITF and one WTA doubles titles. When she appeared at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, Wood became the first Briton, male or female, to take part in three Olympic tennis tournaments. Heather Watson later equalled Wood’s feat and only the Murray brothers, Andy and Jamie, have competed in more. Wood’s best performance was in the doubles in 1996 when, partnering Valda Lake, she reached the quarter-finals before losing in straight sets to the eventual gold medallists, Gigi Fernandez and Mary Joe Fernandez of the USA. Wood also represented Great Britain in the Federation Cup (now the Billie Jean King Cup) between 1988-97, with an 18/10 record in singles, and 16/8 in doubles. In 1989, she played in the very last Wightman Cup match for Great Britain again the United States. America won 7-0 and Wood lost her singles 0-6, 0-6 to Jennifer Capriati, who became the youngest ever Wightman cup player. Having reached WTA high rankings of 77th in the singles (1994), and 59th in doubles (1996) Wood retired in 1998 following a recurring leg injury. Her last WTA singles match was on centre court at Wimbledon in 1997 when she lost 0-6, 0-6 to the 1995 champion Arantxa Sánchez Vicario of Spain. Wood’s best Grand Slam performance was in 1995 when she reached the quarter-final of the mixed doubles at Wimbledon with Mark Petchey, before losing to Grant Connell of Canada and Lindsay Davenport of the USA. Wood’s best singles performance was at the 1991 Australian Open when she reached the third round, but lost to Natalya (later Natasha) Zvereva. The next British woman to reach the third round in Melbourne was Elena Baltacha in 2005.

Between 1999-2002 she was a supervisor on the WTA Tour, also became a Gold Badge Referee. Between 2002-08 Wood worked in the Referee’s Office at Wimbledon as an assistant referee, and in 2004 officiated as an Assistant Referee for the tennis tournament at the Athens Olympics.

This was a puzzle and he could not be identified and remained the only individual Olympic medalist from the United States for whom the full name was not known. But eventually a distant relative of Strebler’s contacted the OlyMADmen, and we learned his identity. He was actually Louis Bernard Strebler, with the “Z” in “Z. B.” obviously mistaken for an “L”. He was born in St. Louis, Missouri, to Peter and Amelia Ungerman Strebler. As a student he attended St. Peter and Paul’s School in St. Louis, where he began wrestling. The 1904 Olympic wrestling events also doubled as the United States national championships, which were conducted by the AAU for many years. Strebler represented the South Broadway Athletic Club of St. Louis. At the Olympics he competed in both the 125 lb. class, in which he won his bronze medal, and the 135 lb. class, in which he was unplaced. He never competed in any other national championships in wrestling. After the Olympics, Strebler decided to become a professional boxer and started training towards that end, but tragedy struck. His great nephew, Vincent Saporita, described it, “In those days, the street cars only stopped for the women. It did not stop for the men. Louis ran to jump on the street car, slipped, fell under the wheels, and lost an arm above the elbow. That was the end of his athletic career.” But it did not stop him from making something of his life. He and his brother opened a moving company, and he worked for many years as a one-armed furniture mover, before dying in St. Louis in 1962.",

His gold medals came in the 50 and 100 yds freestyle in 1904 and the 4 x 250 m relay in 1906. His 1904 50 yds freestyle victory came in a second race after the judges declared a dead heat in the first race between Halmay and J. Scott Leary of the United States. What is more remarkable, is that although Halmay swam mostly with his arms, without any leg movements, he still beat the strong Americans, who used their legs while swimming and thus had a more efficient style. In both his 1904 gold medals, he beat young Charlie Daniels, who went on to be the most dominant swimmer of the decade and who invented the “American crawl” that is the basis of modern freestyle swimming. In 1905 Halmay set what is considered the inaugural record for the 100 m freestyle, recording 1:05.8, which stood until the 1908 Olympics, where Daniels surpassed it by 0.2 seconds, a remarkable length of time during a period of rapid development in the sport. Halmay set his second world record in 1908, just three weeks before the 1908 Olympics, when he swam the 200 m freestyle in 2:26.8, bettering Fred Lane’s 6-year old record by nearly 2 seconds. Halmay won 15 Hungarian titles – 100 yds freestyle in 1899, 1901-04, 1906, and 1907; 110 yds freestyle in 1908; 220 yds freestyle in 1906-08; 440 yds freestyle in 1905 and 1907; and 1 mile freestyle in 1897 and 1899. He also won English, German and Austrian championships. Halmay took up competitive swimming in 1896 and competed until 1910. Besides swimming he played football and water polo and did track & field athletics and rowing. He was also Hungarian national roller-skating champion over 5000 m. From 1910-19 Halmay worked as a journalist with the Hungarian sports paper Vadász és Versenylap and from 1919-28 was manager of the Hungarian national swimming team. He then worked with the Hungarian Royal Tobacco Monopoly, first as an office worker and then as a director.

In June 1917 Kullerstrand broke the national record with 1.89, which placed him second on the year’s world list. The major part of Kullerstrand´s track career occurred during World War I, and inter-national competitions were very rare. Mostly he traded wins with his Swedish peers, and managed to win the event in a few of the more important local meets. In 1911 an English team met a Swedish one in Stockholm, and Kullerstrand emerged as the winner, which would have been a nice victory, if the guests had sent a high jumper. Instead, his biggest win was probably a victory over US star, Jo Loomis, at a late-season 1916 contest in Stockholm. Kullerstrand was selected for the 1914 Baltic Games, where he finished second to fellow Swede, I. Reimers.

45590,Maria Lenk,Female,15 January 1915,,, Brazil,BRA,"Maria Lenk was a pioneer in women’s swimming. Lenk was the first Brazilian woman and the first from South America to compete at the Olympics. Lenk was also the first woman to use the butterfly stroke in an official competition and the first Brazilian woman to set a world record in swimming. Lenk and her sister Sieglinde Lenk were daughters of German immigrants who came to Brazil in 1912. After contracting double pneumonia when she was 10, her parents thought that swimming would be good for her health. With no local swimming pools Lenk was taught how to swim in the Tietê River. In the early 1930s Lenk won four consecutive titles in the traditional 5.5km swimming race “Travessia de São Paulo a Nado”. At the age of 17 Lenk became the first South American woman to compete at the Olympics when she took part at the 1932 Los Angeles Olympics. In Los Angeles Lenk swam in the 100 metres freestyle, the 100 metres backstroke, and the 200 metres breaststroke but failed to advance from the heats in each race. Four years later Lenk competed in the 200 metres breaststroke at the 1936 Berlin Olympics where she reached the semi-finals. In the breaststroke event in Berlin Lenk swam with the butterfly stroke – the first time it had been used in an international race. Butterfly was not yet recognised as a swimming stroke in its own right, with Lenk saying she was trying to develop a new way of swimming the breaststroke. Following the Olympics Lenk went on to set world records in the breaststroke. In November 1939 Lenk set a world record in the 200 metres breaststroke, with the record lasting until August 1946. Also in 1939 Lenk set a world record in the now-discontinued 400 metres breaststroke. Lenk had reached her peak, but her dreams of winning an Olympic medal did not happen following the outbreak of World War II. Despite the onset of war Lenk was part of a South American delegation of swimmers that toured the United States in the early 1940s. While in the US Lenk broke 12 North American swimming records and went to study physical education at the University of Illinois. Lenk retired from competitive swimming in 1942 but continued to enter Masters events. Even into her 90s Lenk swam nearly a mile every day. In 1988 Lenk was inducted into the FINA Swimming Hall of Fame. In 2004 the Brazilian Olympic Committee bestowed her with the Adhemar Ferreira da Silva Trophy for lifetime achievement. In February 2007 Rio de Janeiro’s mayor named the city’s new aquatic centre after Lenk (“Parque Aquático Maria Lenk”), with the venue being used to host events at the 2007 Pan American Games and the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Olympics.","Sister of Sieglinde Lenk Listed in Olympians Who Set a World Record in Long Course Swimming (200 m breaststroke – 8 November 1939 - 19 March 1941: 2:56.0 (8 November 1939; Rio de Janeiro, BRA)) Listed in Olympic Order Recipients (2000 (Silver)) Listed in First Female Competitors at the Olympics by Country (First woman to compete for Brazil)"

76826,Prajim Wongsuwan,Male,13 August 1938,171.0,64, Thailand,THA,"Prajim Wongsuwan’s first major championship was the 1958 Asian Games where he took leave from training as a military cadet to form part of the Thai 4 x 100m and 4 x 400m relay teams that both took 5th place in their respective finals. Individually, he failed to progress from the heats of the 200m. His Olympic appearance in Rome was less impressive as he placed 41st of 47 in the long jump qualifying, and his presence in the sprint relay was fleeting as Wongsuwan’s team finished last in their heat. A second Asian Games in 1962 saw him again compete in the 4 x 100m but, unlike four years earlier, his team failed to qualify for the final. After 1962 he focussed on his military career and had reached the rank of Sergeant Major when he resigned from the Thai Army in 1967. Wongsuwan then organized a group of mercenaries to fight alongside regular Thai Army, US and South Vietnamese forces against Northern Vietnamese forces intent of overthrowing the government of Laos. He was wounded in the conflict, and spent time in a prisoner of war camp in Điện Biên Phủ, Vietnam before being released and returned to Thailand in 1973. On returning home he used his military knowledge to forge a new career as a novelist under the pen name Sumuphu Thotphon. Unsurprisingly his sixteen published books were based on his own experiences as a mercenary, with one of the most popular made into a successful film in 1977 under the title “Haek kai narok dien bien phu” or “The Great Escape from Dien Bien Phu” in its English translation. Wonsuwan died relatively young, succumbing to heart disease in 1990 at the age of 53. Personal Bests: 100 – unknown; LJ – unknown.",

122,Max Woosnam,Male,6 September 1892,,, Great Britain,GBR,"Max Woosnam was a man of such talent and versatility that he must be ranked as one of the greatest all-rounders in the history of the British sport. He was an international or first-class player at association football, lawn tennis, golf, cricket, real tennis and racquets. Woosnam himself said “If I was any good at anything, it was football” but such were his achievements that it is advisable to review them chronologically rather than try to assess their respective merits. Max Woosnam was educated at Winchester where he was captain of cricket and golf and played for the College at football and rackets. When he went up to Trinity College, Cambridge he played against Oxford at football, golf, lawn tennis and real tennis with perhaps the only surprise of his wonderful University career being his failure to win a fifth blue at cricket. In his freshman year, 1912, he played for the University in every game before losing his place at the last minute for the Oxford match and went to Lord’s as 12th man. After his sporting commitments at Cambridge were complete for the 1914 season, Woosnam went on the Corinthians FC tour of Brazil but no sooner had the team arrived in South America than the news arrived of the outbreak of war in Europe. The touring party spent just one night in Rio and took the next boat home. Within 24 hours of docking at Tilbury every man in the team was with the Colours, Woosnam joining the Montgomeryshire Yeomanry before transferring to the Royal Welch Fusiliers. After service in France, Woosnam left the Army early in 1919 and returned to Cambridge. He was elected captain of cricket that summer but he again failed to hold his place in the team for the match against Oxford and it was then that he decided to concentrate on lawn tennis. His victory in the men’s doubles with Noel Turnbull at the 1920 Olympics was his first major success and in Antwerp he also won an Olympic silver medal in the mixed doubles partnering Kathleen “Kitty” McKane. Woosnam was also selected as a member of the association football squad for the 1920 Olympics but as the soccer tournament began as soon as the lawn tennis program ended, he felt he could not spend any more time away from his work and so withdrew. In May 1921 he made a winning Davis Cup début in the doubles against Spain with Randolph Lycett as his partner. The same pair went on to win the Wimbledon title in 1921. Woosnam was again a member of the Olympic team in 1924 but failed to repeat his successes of four years earlier, being eliminated in the early stages of the singles and the men’s doubles. During this golden era, Max Woosnam turned to football when the summers were over. Before the war, he had played for Chelsea while still an undergraduate but when he left Cambridge in 1919 he joined the staff at ICIC in Manchester and remained with the company until his retirement in 1954. He made 93 appearances for Manchester City between 1920 and 1925 and captained the team when they were runners-up for the First Division championship in 1920-21. Woosnam won three international caps in the 1921-1922 season, playing against Wales and Ireland in the amateur internationals and captaining the full international team, also against Wales. Woosnam was a dominating centre-half with a ferocious shoulder charge and in his three international appearances, England did not concede a single goal. Shortly after the game against Wales a broken leg ended his football career.",Listed in Olympians Who Played First-Class Cricket (Played 2 First Class matches (Cambridge University))

She was Western Athletic Conference player-of-the-year that season and led her team to the Sweet 16 at the NCAA Tournament. Her jersey was retired by Colorado State in 2005 and she was inducted into the Colorado State Sports Hall of Fame in 2004. Hammon then joined the WNBA and became one of the great players in that league, playing through the 2014 season as a point guard. She initially played with the New York Liberty, but also played for the Tennessee Fury and Colorado Chill in the NWBL (National Women’s Basketball League), and eventually playing with the San Antonio Silver Stars. During her WNBA career, Hammon was a first-team All-WNBA selection in 2009 and was the seventh WNBA player to score 5,000 points, surpassing that milestone in 2011. Hammon also played overseas in her off-seasons, playing in Italy with Trentino Rovereto Basket (2001–2002), Rivas Ecópolis (2006–2007), CSKA Moskva (2007–2009), Ros Casares Valencia (2009–2010), Orenburg (2010-2011), and Spartak (2011-2012). Her tenure with CSKA Moskva eventually led to some controversy. Hammon was never selected to play for the United States internationally, but wanted to play in the Olympics so in 2007 she obtained Russian citizenship and eventually played for Russia at the 2008 and 2012 Olympic Games. She was criticized by several other American players and coaches for doing this but the controversy subsided. While playing in San Antonio Hammon began attending practices with the NBA San Antonio Spurs, and came under the influence of Spurs’ coach Gregg Popovich. In August 2014 Hammon made history when Popovich asked her to become a full-time assistant coach for the Spurs after she retired at the end of the season. She thus became the first female to be a fully recognized assistant coach in the NBA. In July 2015 she coached the Spurs team in the NBA Summer League, and led them to the title, becoming the first woman head coach of an NBA team at any level. On 30 December 2020 she made NBA history during the regular season when she became the first woman to serve as head coach after Popovich was ejected from a game. In December 2021 Hammon was named the new head coach of the Las Vegas Aces in the WNBA (Women’s National Basketball Association), and in 2022 she led them to the WNBA Championship, the first rookie coach to lead a WNBA team to the league title.

In 1953 he showed his ability in major events, finishing second at Holmenkollen and Svenska Skidspelen, and winning a bronze medal at the National Championships.

He was a substitute for the jumping competition, but defending champion Arnfinn Bergmann fell ill, and on short notice Stallvik was put on the four-man Norwegian team. He ended in ninth place, best of the Norwegian jumpers, in a very disappointing Olympic competition for Norway, which had taken the gold medal at all six earlier ski jumping Olympic competitions.

In his studio she met – at the age of seventeen – her future husband Mario Gamero, with whom she developed a congeniality. The couple married in 1934 and together they opened a studio. She was quite successful during the time prior to World War II with exhibitions in Turin, Rome and Bologna, at the 1936 Olympics in Berlin and in Paris in 1937. Her paintings from this period were still affected by the late Art Deco, serene and with clear colors. After the end of the war, Pinetta Colonna-Gamero took up teaching at secondary schools and also founded and ran a painting school in her own studio. She developed a more expressionistic style with harder and darker colors. With no own children her pictures became concerned with grief and death and she later painted dark looming industrial structures in Turin. She painted until her last days.

After joining the Hónved Club to train under Mihály Igloi, Iharos broke six individual world records in 1955, and added a relay world record as well. On 14 May in Budapest he ran 7:55.6 to break the 3,000 record. Then in London, on 30 May, he shattered the 2-mile world record by seven seconds, recording 8:33.4. In Budapest on 10 September, Iharos ran 5,000 metres in 13:50.8 to break that mark, and 13 days later he took another 10 seconds off it, recording 13:40.6, again in Budapest, also garnering a 3-mile world record of 13:14.2 en route. Iharos moved up to the 10K in 1956, breaking that record in Budapest in July with 28:42.8, also taking the 6-mile world record. In all he set 12 world records in his career, with four in relays. But a few weeks after his 10K record, the Soviet Union invaded Hungary and he never made it to Melbourne for the Olympics he might have dominated. Born as Sándor Izrael, Iharos had no Soviet sympathies and never joined the Communist Party, which was unusual at the time. Although many Hungarian athletes went to Melbourne and defected, his family back in Hungary obviated this as an option. He continued to compete and ran at the 1960 Olympics but never approached his form of 1955-56. His coach, Igloi, had moved to the United States in response to the Soviet invasion, and that and the political situation surely contributed to his diminution in form.

In the overall standings of the World Cup Plankensteiner was ranked second in doubles in 1997. He took part in five editions of the Winter Olympics making his début in singles in Albertville in 1992. His other four appearances were all in doubles, highlighted by the bronze medal in Torino in 2006 together with Oswald Haselrieder. He finished his career when Haselrieder was seriously injured in March 2010. Winning the Olympic bronze medalist in Torino was overshadowed in Italy due to an incident that occurred immediately after the race. Plankensteiner, when asked by a journalist whether in case of victory he would have sung the national anthem replied: “I do not know that song”, thus triggering a controversy in the national press and the political world. Almost immediately, Plankensteiner, a German native speaker, gave his version of events. He declared that he had misunderstood the question because of the emotion of the moment and because he did not speak the Italian language well, not having understood that the Mameli anthem was just another way of referring to the national anthem of the Italian Republic. At the World Championships Plankensteiner won four bronze medals in doubles and team, and two golds, the gold medals coming in 1989, at age 17 in the team event, and in doubles in 2009.

McGwire played in college at Southern Cal, after which he was the 10th overall pick of the 1984 Major League Baseball Draft, selected by the Oakland Athletics. McGwire played in the Major Leagues from 1986-2001. He was with the Athletics from 1986-97, and spent his last five years with the St. Louis Cardinals in the National League. He hit 583 home runs in his career, and led the majors in home runs five times, in 1987 and 1996-99. He was a 12-time All-Star. In 1998 McGwire hit 70 home runs, breaking the vaunted Major League record of 61 by Roger Maris in 1961. During that year, he and Sammy Sosa engaged in a chase to break Maris’s record, with McGwire coming out on top, as Sosa finished the year with 66. The home run record chase captivated the American sports public in the summer of ‘98. McGwire and Sosa repeated their record-breaking ways in 1999, as McGwire hit 66 homers and Sosa 63. However, during the year it was revealed that McGwire was found to be taking androstenedione, an over-the-counter anabolic steroid analogue which was, however, not banned at the time by Major League Baseball. It was also rumored that he was using stronger anabolic steroids, because of significant increase in muscle mass in the last few years. McGwire later admitted to using steroids. Sosa was similarly suspected of using performance enhancing drugs, but at a 2005 Congressional hearing, Sosa, through his attorney, insisted he had never taken PEDs. Despite the records he set, because of the opprobrium that hounded him by the steroid rumors, McGwire was not inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame (through 2020). He later became a respected hitting coach for the St. Louis Cardinals, Los Angeles Dodgers, and San Diego Padres in the Major Leagues. In 2000 McGwire was named to the Major League Baseball All-Century Team.",Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the Summer Pan American Games (0–0–1 1983 Caracas BSB bronze) Listed in Olympians Who Played on a World Series Champion (1984 Olympics (Demonstration). 1989 Oakland Athletics.)

Following in the footsteps of her compatriot Carolyn Waldo, she won the solo world title in Perth in 1991, branding her as the favourite for the Olympic gold in Barcelona. But a week before the Barcelona Games, Fréchette found her fiancé and manager Sylvain Lake dead in their apartment, having committed suicide. She decided to leave for Spain in spite of this, where things got even worse. In the figures routine, she was awarded only an 8.7 (instead of an 9.7) by Brazilian judge Ana Maria da Silveira. The judge had pressed the wrong button, and immediately tried to correct this, but she was too late. This difference turned out to cost Fréchette the gold medal, which instead went to Kristen Babb-Sprague of the US. Because of the efforts of Canadian IOC-member Dick Pound, the result was eventually changed and Fréchette was awarded her gold medal in a special ceremony in Montréal, while Babb-Sprague was allowed to keep her medal as well. Fréchette, who had by that time become a television host, returned to synchronized swimming in 1994, and made the Canadian team for Atlanta. Returning home with a silver medal, she retired again.

A two-time Hungarian flyweight champion (1957-58), Török’s first success at the top level was a flyweight silver medal at the 1959 European Championships after losing to German Manfred Homberg by points. The high point of Török’s career was at the 1960 Olympics, where he defeated three opponents by decision and one by knock-out to reach the final against Soviet Sergey Sivko. The Olympic flyweight final between Török and Sivko was closely fought, with the gold awarded to Török after a narrow 3-2 decision. After the 1960 Olympics, Török switched to bantamweight and although he won three Hungarian bantamweight titles (1961, 1962 and 1964), he was less successful at the international level. As a bantamweight, Török fought at the 1961 European Championships, where he lost his quarter-final bout to Italian Primo Zamparini, and at the 1964 Olympics, where he was knocked out in his round one bout by Soviet Oleg Grigoryev. Török retired from sports in 1966 and for the next 40 years worked at the Kispest Granite Factory. Török also remained active in boxing circles as a coach, serving as the boxing coach for Építők SC from 1976-78 and for Csepel SC from 1978-81. In 1993, Török was briefly head coach of the Hungarian national team and he later worked as an assistant coach for the Hungarian national team and was also an advisor to the president of the Hungarian Boxing Federation.",

105512,Usain Bolt,Male,21 August 1986,196.0,95, Jamaica,JAM,"Usain Bolt first came to international attention when he won the 200 metres at the 2002 World Junior Championships, adding the World Youth title at 200 metres in 2003. He competed at the 2004 Olympics in that event but failed to get out of the early rounds. In 2007 Bolt won a silver medal in the 200 at the World Championships, presaging his 2008 breakout year. On 31 May 2008 at the Reebok Grand Prix in New York, Bolt broke the 100 metre world record by recording 9.72, setting him up as a favorite for the sprint event at the 2008 Olympics. Together with Michael Phelps, Usain Bolt was the star of the Beijing Games, in which he won three gold medals. His first victory came in the 100 metres, winning with ease in a world record time of 9.69, despite easing down in the final metres to celebrate. He added golds in the 200 metres, breaking Michael Johnson’s 1996 world record in the process, and the 4×100 metres relay, breaking another world record with his teammates. Bolt, having become the icon of track & field athletics, repeated this performance at the 2009 World Championships in Berlin, winning the same three events and recording world records in the 100 (9.58) and 200 metres (19.19). At the 2011 Worlds, he stumbled slightly when he false started in the 100 and was disqualified but he repeated as gold medalist in the 200 and the 4x100 relay. This led to his 2012 year, when Bolt became the first track athlete to win 3 Olympic gold medals at two consecutive Olympics, again winning both sprints and the sprint relay with the Jamaican team. Bolt then repeated this feat at the 2013 and 2015 World Championships, giving him five major international championships (2 Olympics, 3 Worlds) at which he won the sprint treble, and established himself without peer and as the greatest sprinter of all-time. Bolt continued to run and competed at the 2016 Rio Olympics. He again won the sprint triple, winning the 100 and 200, and anchoring Jamaica to sprint relay gold. This seemed to give him nine gold medals, equalling the marks of the redoubtable Finnish distance runner Paavo Nurmi and legendary Carl Lewis. However, shortly before Rio, Bolt’s teammate on the 2008 relay, Nesta Carter, was revealed to have a positive doping test at Beijing. In January 2017, Carter was sanctioned and disqualified, which also led Jamaica to lose that gold medal, bringing Bolt’s total down to eight golds.

In the 1907 Challenge round, Gore and Barrett lost the first two sets to the Australasian pair, Norman Brookes and Tony Wilding, but after squaring the match they took the final set 13-11. In 1900, Gore beat the great Laurie Doherty at Dublin, Beckenham and Wimbledon and was honored with the captaincy of Britain’s first Davis Cup team. The following year he won the first of his three Wimbledon singles titles. Despite his many successes, it is really the longevity of his career that places Wentworth Gore among the lawn tennis immortals. He played at every Wimbledon from 1888 to 1927, a remarkable span of 39 years; he is the oldest winner of the Wimbledon singles (aged 41 in 1909) and he also holds the record of being the oldest Wimbledon singles finalist (aged 44 in 1912). Wentworth Gore learned his tennis on the sand courts of Brittany and although many sources indicate that he was educated at Harrow this is incorrect and he was, in fact, educated abroad.",

95307,Freddie McEvoy,Male,12 February 1907,,, Great Britain,GBR,"Freddie McEvoy was a swashbuckling legend in aristocratic British sporting circles. He was educated at the Jesuit School of Stonyhurst, and early turned his attention to sports, becoming an expert in shooting, race-car driving, deep-sea diving, and boxing. He competed at the Olympics in 1936 as a bobsled driver, after having won the 1935 World Championship in the 4-man. Among his professions are listed jewelry designer, public relations consultant, professional gambler, smuggler, black marketer, and gigolo. He was well-known in European gambling casinos and was known to have won and lost fortunes during his lifetime. He admitted to being a rogue, swindler, and con man who used his intelligence and charm to move among the highest of the monied classes. In appearance, he was almost a twin of his very close friend, Errol Flynn. McEvoy was that rare individual whose life was more exciting than the legend. Among the stories that surround him are that he once killed a man in a barroom brawl in Marseilles, that he once won a $10,000 bet by driving from Paris to Cannes in under 10 hours, and that he once won $25,000 playing backgammon in Monte Carlo and then spent that money the next day to buy a Maserati. In the Maserati he placed 3rd at the 1936 Vanderbilt Trophy races at Roosevelt Raceway on Long Island. When McEvoy won car races, he usually used his earnings to bet on the horses, and when he picked a winner he celebrated by drinking pink champagne. He used his connections and his sociability to marry well several times. The first was in 1940 to a woman twice his age, Beatrice Cartwright, an heiress to the Standard Oil fortune. He and Cartwright had lived together at the Badrutt Palace in St. Moritz for several winters, prior to their marriage. One year, McEvoy brought a much younger model to “care for him,” explaining to Cartwright that he must have a younger bedfellow than her. The marriage lasted two years, and in the same year they were divorced, he married Irene Wrightsman, the 18-year-old daughter of the president of Standard Oil of Kansas. That marriage also lasted but two years, and he spent most of 1944 going back and forth from Mexico City to Beverly Hills, smuggling arms, jewelry, liquor and other valuables into the United States. In Mexico City he stayed with Dorothy di Frasso, one of Freddie’s most generous patrons. Di Frasso spread his fame among her friends for his bedroom performances, which she said was worth all the money she gave him. American bobsledder Billy Fiske, once commented on how much he admired McEvoy, and when someone protested that he could not, he noted, “Yes, I do, I admire anyone who can get away with something that I could not do myself.” In 1945, McEvoy began a long-running affair with the wealthy heiress, Barbara Hutton. Hutton agreed with di Frasso concerning Freddie’s skills, considering him a superb lover, and felt that he understood women better than any man she had ever met. They later lived together at a fashionable ski chalet in Franconia, New Hampshire, which Hutton bought for McEvoy. They never married but remained friends throughout his life. McEvoy eventually married French fashion model Claude Stephanie Filatre. In November 1951 they were sailing on his 104-ton schooner, Kangaroo, near Cap Cantin off the coast of Morocco when a storm hit. The ship went down, but Freddie lashed his wife and maid to the mast, and then swam to shore seeking help. But he was unable to find any assistance and swam back out to the mast. He and Claude Stephanie then began swimming to shore, but she was unable to make it. He attempted to tow her to shore, but the waves pulled them to sea, they crashed against the rocks, and were not seen alive again. Their bodies were recovered the next day.","Listed in Olympians Who Died in Drowning Accidents (Died trying to save his wife from drowning in a boating accident.)

In doubles she teamed with the great British star, Laurie Doherty, in an international pairing. Jones was one of the top American tennis stars at the turn of the century. She and her sister, Georgina (who also competed in the 1900 Olympic tennis events) played at the West Side Tennis Club in New York. The practice enabled Marion to twice win the U.S. women’s title (1899, 1902) and once win the U.S. mixed doubles title (1901). She was also runner-up at the US Championships in 1898 and 1903. In addition, Miss Jones was the first non-British woman to ever play at Wimbledon, reaching the quarter-finals there in the 1900 ladies’ singles. She was Southern California Singles Champion from 1984-98. Jones’ family was from Nevada, where her father, John Percival Jones, was a five-time U.S. Senator. Jones eventually married Robert Farquhar, but they divorced shortly thereafter. From 1920 until 1961, Marion Jones Farquhar lived in Greenwich Village, where she was well known as a violinist and voice coach. She also translated opera librettos and for a short time was head of the New York Chamber Opera.

He announced his arrival as a world class talent with a string of top 10 finishes in World Cup events which gained him selection for the 1994 Winter Games. Okabe narrowly failed to win an individual medal in Lillehammer but appeared a sure-fire winner in the team event until a disastrous final jump by Masahiko Harada dropped the Japanese team out of the gold medal position. Four years later the team made amends by sealing the team title on home snow in Nagano with Oakabe leading the team from his position as first to jump in each round.

Vader won her first national championships in 1979 with victories in the 100 and 200 metres, and the 60 metres indoors title. Outdoors she won the 100 metres four more times (1980–82, 1984), along with six titles in the 200 metres (1980–82, 1984, 1986, 1988). At the indoor championships she won five more 60 metres titles (1980–82, 1984–85), and five 200 metres titles (1982, 1984–85, 1987–88). Vader competed at her first Olympic Games in 1980 in Moskva where she ran in the 100 and 200 metres. In the 100 metres she finished in fourth place in her heat, enough to advance to the next round, but she did not start in her quarter-final race. In the 200 metres she reached the semi-finals but finished in last place in her heat. Four years later at the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics Vader ran in the same two events again where she reached the quarter-finals of the 100 metres and the semi-finals of the 200 metres. Her final Olympic Games were in 1988 in Seoul where again she reached the quarter-finals of the 100 metres and was part of the Dutch quartet that reached the semi-finals of the 4 × 100 metres relay. In 1981 Vader set a Dutch record in the 100 metres that was not broken until 1986. A year earlier she had set a national record in the 200 metres that stood for more than 30 years until it was broken by Dafne Schippers in 2011. For her promising start to her career Vader was named as the Dutch Athlete of the Year in 1981. At the 1985 European Athletics Indoor Championships she won the bronze medal in the 200 metres. Vader held another longstanding Dutch record in the same event when she ran the 200 metres indoors in a time of 23.34 seconds in February 1988. The record stood until Lieke Klaver ran 23.17 seconds in January 2021. Vader was married to fellow Olympian and her former coach Haico Scharn.

As a midfielder, he played the final of the 1952 Olympics (which Hungary won) and the 1954 World Cup final (which was shockingly lost to West Germany). Bozsik furthermore played in the 1958 World Cup (1st round exit). In all, Bozsik won 101 caps, as of 2010 still the only Hungarian to reach the number of 100. Domestically, Bozsik played for Honvéd (earlier named Kispest AC) for 20 seasons. He played alongside his brother István, the goalkeeper, for a few seasons. With Honvéd, he enjoyed five national titles. He later became a board member, and served as the club’s manager in 1966-1967. He was also made national team coach in 1974, but had to step down due to poor health. In 1953, Bozsik was “elected” a member of parliament for the Hungarian communist party, who had put him on the list due to the popularity of the national football team. He was removed from his seat in 1957. Bozsik died in 1978, but was memorized in 1986 when the renovated Honvéd stadium was renamed Bozsik Stadion.",Listed in Olympians Who Were Members of National Legislatures (Member of Hungarian Országgyűlés from 1950 through 1953 (MDP))
69129,Basil Heatley,Male,25 December 1933,173.0,66, Great Britain,GBR,"Basil Heatley grew up on a farm not far from Coventry in the English Midlands. Directed to running as it was thought he was too skinny to be a rugby player, Heatley excelled at cross country and regularly placed in the top ten at national junior cross-country championships although he was never to win a junior title. In 1954 he began his three years of military service with the Royal Army Veterinary Corps and, with the bulk of his training being done in the early mornings, he entered and won his first marathon, the Midlands Marathon, in 1956. The following year he made a major breakthrough in cross country where he finished highly in the English Championships and then ran second to Frank Sando in the International Cross-Country Championships in Waregem, Belgium. Heatley started out well in 1958 with a team title with England when the International Cross-Country Championships were held in Cardiff, but he failed to transfer this form to the track, and he missed selection for the British Empire Games. Heatley continued to excel over the cross-country tracks, helping England to team titles at the International Cross-Country Championships in 1959 and 1960 then winning the individual title in 1961 but a badly timed knee injury robbed him of a chance to qualify for the 10,000 m at the Roma Olympics. After his victorious start to the year he raced a heavy schedule around the tracks of Europe in 1961 which was highlighted by victory in world record time in the AAA 10 miles. Tired from a long season and about to get married he took an extended break from training which ruined his chances of making a major championship debut in 1962 and he resolved that the marathon would now be his exclusive goal. He placed second behind European champion Brian Kilby in the AAA marathon of 1963 but it was the 1964 Polytechnic Marathon, the trial for the British Olympic team, that sealed his place in history. Running head to head with Ron Hill both men beat Buddy Edelen’s year old world record but it was Heatley who crossed the line first in 2-13:55. This established him as one of the major rivals to reigning champion Abebe Bikila as the Ethiopian attempted to defend his gold medal in Rome. Heatley struggled in the opening stages of the Olympic marathon after he developed a severe stitch but ran through his problems and rallied after the halfway mark. As he entered the stadium, he was in the bronze medal position and gaining on Japan’s Kokichi Tsuburaya. With a final sprint he gained 30 metres on the home athlete and passed him on the home straight to win the silver medal. Tsuburaya was crushed that he had been passed on the track by Heatley in front of the Tokyo crowd. He vowed to improve and pushed himself in training, but it resulted in multiple injuries. Finally, in early January 1968, Tsuburaya committed suicide by slashing his carotid artery with a razor blade. The 1964 Olympic marathon was the last major race for the self-coached Heatley, although he continued to race for his club in national competition for many years afterwards. During his career he worked for Morris Motors but after Tokyo he went into groundsmanship and worked for his local council in the leisure and recreation department.

He never fully recovered from his wounds and died in 1931 at the age of 46.

Maitland placed third in the national road race championships in 1944 and 1946 then won the title in 1948, a victory that earned him a spot on the British Olympic team. He figured prominently in the Olympic road race but could not muster a sufficient sprint to secure a medal. His sixth place was however enough to help his team to the silver medal position. Maitland again finished third in the national championships and ninth at the World Championships in 1949 but afterwards transferred his allegiance to the breakaway British League of Racing Cyclists, a group opposed to the way the National Cycling Union governed British cycling, and lost his amateur status. He won the BLRC’s version of the British title in 1953, was placed in both 1952 and 1954 and also finished third in the Tour of Britain stage race in 1953. In 1955 he was called up to the British national team to contest the 1955 Tour de France but retired at the end of the first week of cycling. He also briefly ran his own Maitland Cycles team at the end of the fifties. He returned to the sport as a veteran and won titles in 65-69 age group at the UCI World Masters Championships.

87207,Günther Huber,Male,28 October 1965,177.0,89, Italy,ITA,"Like his brothers, Günther Huber began his career as a luger with his best result being a bronze medal at the Junior World Championships in his specialty, doubles in 1982. He switched to bobsledding as a pilot in 1988 , stating he was “tired of losing against the brothers.” In this new discipline he achieved all his best results. He participated in four consecutive Winter Olympics, winning the bronze medal in the two-man bobsled together with Stefano Ticci in 1994. At the same Olympics, his brothers Wilfried and Norbert also took home medals, while Arnold had to settle for fourth place. At Nagano in 1998 Günther Huber won gold in the two-man with brakeman Antonio Tartaglia, tied with the Canadian crew of Pierre Lueders. During his career Huber won two medals at World Championships, both in the two-man, a silver medal in 1997 with Tartaglia and the gold medal in 1999. This success came after a disastrous period, which started four months prior with the theft of his bob, continued with injuries to his long-time partner Tartaglia and substitute Massimiliano Rota, and ultimately ended with another injury to replacement Enrico Costa, who had to be replaced by Ubaldo Ranzi. In the World Cup Huber made the podium for the first time in the 1991-92 season with a third place in St. Moritz in the two-man and in the same event he achieved his first World Cup victory in the following season in Lillehammer. In the overall standings he won the trophy in his specialty, the two-man, in the 1991-92 and 1992-93 seasons, while in 1996-97 he won the combined World Cup. At the European Championships Huber won another six medals, two of them gold, one each in the two-man and four-man event. Between 1991 and 2001 he won seven national titles in the two-man and one in the four-man bob. Huber was a member of the Carabinieri, the national military police of Italy, and became bobsled coach for the Italian national team in 2008. He was awarded the Bronze Cross of Merit of the Army twice (1994, 1999) and the Gold Cross of Merit in 1998.","Brother of Arnold Huber Brother of Norbert Huber Brother of Wilfried Huber Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the European Bob & Skeleton Championships (2–2–2 1991 Cervinia bronze: Two-man; 1994 La Plagne gold: Four-man, silver: Two-man; 1997 Königssee gold: Two-man; 1998 Igls bronze: Two-man; 2000 Cortina d’Ampezzo silver: Two-man) Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the World Bob & Skeleton Championships (FIBT/IBSF) (1–1–0 1997 St. Moritz silver: Two-man; 1999 Cortina d'Ampezzo gold: Two-man) Listed in Olympians Who Received the Italian Olympic Association (CONI) Gold Medal ()"

He then settled in Berlin and in 1935 was involved in the design of the opera in Charlottenburg. Shortly thereafter, he created reliefs for the entrance to the open-air stage for the Reichssportfeld at the Olympic Stadium in Berlin. Wamper gained favor with the Nazis, which spared him from military service. He was known for his monumental sculptures, female nudes, and bas-reliefs. His closest friends were his colleagues Arno Breker and Josef Thorak. Today Wamper’s works are almost vanished through the Berlin cityscape due to the effects of war and bombing. Additionally his Berlin studio was virtually destroyed by an air raid in 1943. The following year, his home was badly damaged, too, and he moved to the vicinity of Bielefeld. After World War II, Wamper became known as the Black Madonna of Remagen, molded from the clay of the US prison camp at Remagen, where Wamper spent the last two months of the war. He became head of sculpture at the Folkwang School in Essen until 1970, when he was appointed professor. His archive is located in Bonn. His figurative sculptures after the war fell out of favor, and thus he fell into oblivion after his death in 1977.",

On 1 January 1960, Kinnear took up the post of National Coach (although the ASA refused to use such a term, calling him the Chief National Technical Officer instead!). He changed the way techniques were taught to swimmers and coaches, placing more emphasis on fitness than style. His techniques revolutionised the sport, and laid the foundation for the success of many British swimmers for years to come.

58154,Bernard Bernard,Male,5 February 1890,,, Great Britain,GBR,"At the age of 16, Bernard Bernard was told that he was unlikely to live beyond the age of 21 or 22. He did, and had an amazing impact on many lives. He won an Olympic wrestling bronze medal in 1920, was a journalist, as well as a health and fitness fanatic, travelled to all corners of the globe, stood as labour party candidate in a General Election, and was a friend of George Bernard Shaw and Tennessee Williams. Furthermore, Bernard was arrested on a multi-dollar mail order scam in the United States which claimed he could help short people get taller – and he was only 1.55 m! Bernard was born in London of German parents in 1890, and his original name was Otto Bernhard Trappschuh. Because of World War I, he was one of the thousands of British-born Germans who changed their patronymic, in this case, from Trappschuh to Bernard and so, from 1920 he was known as Bernard Bernard. He changed his name again in October 1935 by Deed Poll, to Bernard Lytton-Bernard. As a wrestler, Bernard started his career at the German Gymnastic Society in London and in 1910 won the National Amateur Wrestling Society’s Cumberland and Westmorland bantamweight title. He won the freestyle bantamweight title at the Finsbury Park Open-air competition in 1914, shortly before the outbreak of the war. Trappschuh was a conscientious objector to which he appealed for that status. His appeal was heard by the Military Service Act tribunal who sat for the very first time in 1916. The editor of a physical culture magazine at the time, Trappschuh was asked: “What would you do if attacked by an armed assailant?” Pointing out that he had won two wrestling titles, he replied by saying: “I would try to put a lock on him that wouldn’t hurt him. In no circumstance would I take his life?” The appeal was dismissed and Trappschuh went on to serve in the Duke of Cambridge’s Own (Middlesex) Regiment. He saw action in France, Belgium, and Gallipoli and was awarded the British War l and Victory medals. As Bernard Bernard he toured England in the 1920s with strongman Edward Aston, giving lectures on physical culture, and demonstrating wrestling and self-defence moves. Bernard was also the editor of Health and Efficiency magazine at that time, a passion he had had since his days as a teenager when he became a vegetarian in an effort to help his damaged heart as a result of contracting rheumatic fever. Bernard had a varied life and career. He went to live in New York, and then California in the 1920s, working as a journalist. In 1928, however, he was involved in a mail order scam with Clara Louisa Glover, in what became known as the “Glover Height-Increasing Mail Order Fraud”, which grossed Glover and Bernard over $26,000 (close to $500,000 in 2019 dollars). Customers were also encouraged to buy Bernard’s two publications to help with their growth, “Health and Life” and “Correct and Corrective Eating”. Bernard returned to England in 1935 and, after changing his name, stood as a Labour Party candidate in the Spelthorne constituency at the 1935 General Election, but lost by 16,196 votes. Lytton-Bernard left England as World War II was looming and, as a self-styled scientist, philosopher, and humanitarian, travelled around the world to India, South Africa, Cuba, Chile, and Nice, where he operated a school of finance, teaching people how to play the stock market. He ended up in Mexico, where he opened a health resort at Rio Caliente, and died in Mexico in 1975.",

He was an apprentice in a printing house in Oradea, where he learned the technique of lithography. The family then moved to Timișoara, where he produced political cartoons for local newspapers while simultaneously being further trained as a lithographer. In the early 1930s, Cova participated in painting workshops and studied at the Academy of Arts in Budapest. He settled in București in about 1935 and worked for some time in advertising agencies. Cova continued to publish caricatures, especially of Nazi figures, in newspapers that did not sympathize with the German regime. Eventually, hoping to realize his ideals, he joined the Communists only to realize much later his naiveté in this regard. Between 1950 and 1956, he taught drawing and poster design at the “lon Grigorescu” School of Art, while at the same time serving as secretary of the Graphic Design Section of the Union of Artists of Romania, and as vice president of the Association of Design. Cova’s works were characterized by a strong sense of form. Despite the restrictions imposed by the corset of propaganda, he strove for an expressive, concisely composed pictorial poster with maximum visual impact. After 1965, he resumed painting of still lifes, landscapes, and portraits, and exhibited in solo shows, the last one taking place in 1983. The gouache submitted in 1952 was titled We shall defend the Peace and was probably created as part of the anti-war propaganda in the early 1950s. Known is a lithograph by Iosif Cova showing the words We want peace.",

After initially providing musical accompaniment for silent film screenings, he served as a member of the Toronto Symphony Orchestra from 1923-36. Subsequently, he was a member of the Royal York Hotel Trio until 1952. To further his education as a composer, he studied with Canadian John Weinzweig and Frenchman Darius Milhaud (1892-1974), amongst others, and was particularly influenced by Igor Stravinsky. After his time with the Royal York Hotel Trio, Adaskin became head of the music department at the University of Saskatchewan, where he was appointed composer-in-residence. At the same time, he directed the Saskatoon Symphony Orchestra, where he strengthened the field of new music. In 1972 he retired as a freelance composer to Victoria on Vancouver Island, where he wrote the majority of his works. In 1980, Adaskin was awarded the Order of Canada and a year later was made an Officer of the Order. His brothers Harry (1901-94) and John Adaskin (1908-64) were also well-known musicians. In 1988, Murray was preceded in death by his first wife, soprano Frances James (1903-88). His second wife, Asta Dorothea Larsen (*1924), assisted him in recording his last works. The Ballet Symphony from 1951 was one of his early works. It comprised six movements labeled March, Allegro, Pas de deux, Fugue, Adagio and Finale (Rondo Allegro) with a total length of about 26-minutes. The premiere took place in March 1952 at Massey Hall in Toronto during the annual concert of the Canadian League of Composers with the Toronto Symphony Orchestra. The work was written during a workshop with Darius Milhaud in Carpinteria, California. Murray dedicated the work to his brother John. The attempt to perform it as a ballet, however, failed.

He first attracted attention as a runner in 1925 after winning eight consecutive handicap sprints in the Midlands and north of England and was regarded as one of the best 17-year-old athletes seen in Britain for many years. He ran for LMS and Derby & County AC in those early days, and was mentored and coached by Jack Britton of Derby and also local sprinter Billy Grenlay. Hambidge won the 100 yards youths race at the 1925 Northern Athletic Champioship at Fallowfield, Manchester and in the summer of 1925 joined the crack Birmingham club, Birchfield Harriers and spent six years with them until 1931.. Overshadowed by his Birchfield teammate, Billy Green, John Hambidge never succeeded in winning a Midland Counties title and also failed to reach a AAA final. However he represented England against Cambridge University at Fenners in 1928, finishing second to Cyril Gill in the 220 yards and was then selected for the 200 metres and sprint relay at the Olympics. A month after the 1928 Games he represented British Railways against the French Railways in Paris and won the 100 and 200 metres. In July 1929 Hambidge had the distinction of winning the 100 yards at the opening of Birchfield Harriers new stadium at Perry Barr. That same year, he also represented the AAAs against Cambridge University. In May 1930 he was involved in a bizarre accident while taking part in a 220 yards race in Derby when a young girl ran in front of him and he crashed to the ground heavily receiving multiple bruising. He was scheduled to compete in the annual meeting of the Geneva Sports Club at Stamford Bridge two days later and to everyone’s astonishment he was back on the track and ran the second 220-yard leg of the one mile relay which Birchield Harriers won. Hambidge won many sprint titles at the annual LMS Railway Championships over the years. At the end of his career he took up cross-country running. Hambidge worked on the railways for well over 30 years and In 1949 was appointed the Chief Controller and Chief Train Clerk in Glasgow, before being appointed in 1954 to the senior British Railways position of Operating Superintendant at Stoke-on-Trent, which saw him look after 1300 staff and 600 passenger and goods trains.

This result, together with his 1906 selection for the Athina Games (in which he did not start), saw him as one of the best Italian specialists in the 400 metres, an event that in those years was only raced in the cities of Torino and Roma.

97565,Harry Sinden,Male,14 September 1932,179.0,81, Canada,CAN,"Harry James Sinden began his lifelong affiliation with ice hockey as a defenseman with the Toronto Marlboro Bantams prior to joining the Oshawa Generals of the Junior Ontario Hockey League for four years, beginning in 1949. After Hambly Arena burned down in 1953, taking the Oshawa Generals with it, Sinden joined the temporary replacement team, the Ottawa Truckmen, and remained with them when they became the Whitby Dunlops in 1954. He won his first Allan Cup, given annually to the senior men’s ice hockey champions in Canada, in 1957 with the team, a victory that earned them the right to represent Canada at the 1958 World Championships. After a gold medal triumph at that tournament the Dunlops won the Allan Cup a second time in 1959, but turned down of the offer to play for Canada at the 1960 Winter Olympics. When the Kitchener-Waterloo Dutchmen accepted the call, Sinden was recruited to join them. At the tournament he played seven games, scored four goals, and took home a silver medal. He played 38 games with the Dunlops that season, but it was his last with the team. He was on the Montreal Canadiens negotiation list that year, but he was never signed to the team. After five playoff matches with the Hull-Ottawa Canadiens of the Eastern Professional Hockey League, he played with the Kingston Frontenacs until 1963. In 1962 he was named the league’s top defenseman (an honor shared with Jean Gauthier) and repeated the feat in 1963 (solo), in addition to being named MVP. In his final season he also served as player/coach with the Frontenacs and suited up for one game with the Providence Reds of the American Hockey League. His final three seasons were spent with the Central Pacific Hockey League, which began in 1963 and ended in 1968. He spent 1963 through 1965 with the Minneapolis Bruins (the successor team to the Frontenacs), functioning as player/coach for the first season, and then had a final year with the Oklahoma City Blazers (who in turn had succeeded the Bruins). Sinden’s hockey career, however, was far from over. He was signed as head coach of the Boston Bruins of the National Hockey League in May 1966, and entered as the youngest coach in the league at the age of 33. Although his was the worst team in the NHL during his first year as coach, the Bruins began a rapid improvement: they had a winning record in his second season, were second in this league by his third, and won a Stanley Cup in his fourth. His success with the team, however, did not endear him to its management and he retired several days after this victory, taking a job with a home construction company. In 1972 he was offered head coaching jobs with the New York Islanders, the Toronto Maple Leafs, and the St. Louis Blues, but turned them all down. He finally accepted a position as head coach and manager of the Canadian team at the Summit Series, an eight-game Soviet versus Canada tournament, which Canada took four games to three, with one tie. Sinden’s tape-recorded account of the events was turned into a book entitled “Hockey Showdown”. Several days after the Summit Series he rejoined the Bruins, this time in the capacity of general manager, and held that position for 28 years. During the 1979-1980 and 1984-1985 seasons he temporarily took over the role of head coach midseason. In 1989 he was also made president, a title that he held until his 2006 retirement, and is now a senior consultant to team owner Jeremy Jacobs. In 1983 he was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame as a builder.

In 1910 he was discovered by the industrialist Pirelli and switched to the Italian club Milano with two other teammates. A high-scoring forward (97 goals in 88 appearances), “Luigi” Van Hege soon became one of the most popular players on the club. In 1912 he scored five goals in one match against Juventus. His career was interrupted by World War I, during which he played for the Front Wanderers, the national military team. Van Hege returned to Union in 1919, winning his third Belgian title in 1923 and remaining with this club until his retirement in 1924. In total he played 132 matches in the Belgian First Division scoring 24 goals. That same year, 1919, he was first selected for the Belgian team, eventually earning 12 caps. He scored three goals for the Red Devils, and was a member of the winning team at the 1920 Olympics (scoring once in that tournament). Van Hege’s last international came at the 1924 Olympics, when Belgium was swept off the field by Sweden. Van Hege remained connected with Union, and served as vice-president of the club from 1952-63.

He did not fare as well at the 1908 Olympics, however, losing his only match to Fred Davis in the bantamweight, freestyle event. In the following year, Knight won another amateur title in the featherweight class on 30 January 1909, though soon after, his wrestling career would unfortunately become marred by a tragedy in the latter weeks of the following month. In a friendly match held at Fulham Baths gymnasium against Arthur Charles of Chelsea, as per witness accounts, Knight had Charles in a hold and had lifted him for the purpose of putting him on his back when the latter slipped and fell landing on the back of his head. This led to Charles sustaining critical injuries from which he later died in hospital two days later. Owing to the effects of the recent incident, Knight opted not to defend his bantamweight championship title later that year, though he would go on to win it again in 1911. He continued to maintain a presence in the wrestling scene until at least the 1930s, as an official. Outside of sports, Knight worked as a carpenter and later an aircraft parts manufacturing supervisor, residing in New Malden for most of his life.",

By the age of 10 he was already excelling in field hockey and, at 16, was selected to join the Canadian men’s national field hockey team. His first major international tournament was the 1975 Pan American Games, where the Canadian squad won a silver medal after losing the final to Argentina. His next stop was the 1976 Summer Olympics, where his nation finished 10th in a home Olympics after being eliminated in the preliminary rounds for having won one game and lost four. His luck did not improve at the 1978 World Cup, where the Canadians finished 11th, although they managed to defend their silver medal at the 1979 Pan American Games, once again losing the final to Argentina. He claimed gold at the 1983 edition, however, as the Canadians were finally able to overcome their long-time national rivals. With Canada having joined the American-led boycott of the 1980 Summer Olympics, Chohan’s next opportunity for Olympic glory came in 1984, but again his nation placed 10th, this time tying once and losing their other four matches. Canada remained in 10th for the 1986 World Cup, but defended its gold medal at the 1987 Pan American Games. The nation slipped to 11th at the 1988 Summer Olympics, with a total record of one win, two ties, and four losses, which was also its rank at the 1990 World Cup. Argentina reclaimed Pan American gold in 1991, leaving the Canadians with silver, and repeated this feat in 1995, where Chohan served as flagbearer and won his final major international medal. He earned the last of his impressive 317 international caps in 1997 and retired from the sport the following year, having been a member of the national team for nearly two and a half decades. His international record also includes four International Cups (1977, 1981, 1985, and 1989), while domestically he played for the Vancouver India Hockey Club as a midfielder.

Shortly after the Innsbruck Olympics, it was revealed that the German pair, Marika Kilius and Hans-Jürgen Bäumler, had signed a professional contract prior to the event. It was felt that the West German Olympic Committee, lobbying the IOC for the 1972 Olympic bid, wanted to present themselves in the best possible manner and encouraged the German skaters to return their medals. The IOC eventually ruled them “non-amateurs” and removed their medals, moving the Josephs up to the bronze medal position, and they did receive bronze medals. However, in 1987, the IOC returned silver medals to Kilius and Bäumler, which was in keeping with the ISU ruling as well, who had never disqualified the German pair. The Josephs kept their bronze medals. Ron Joseph was an excellent all-around athlete. He attended Northwestern University on a track scholarship, placing third in the long jump at the 1964 Big Ten Championships.

His father died when he was an infant, and Alex was subsequently educated at a Surrey boarding school, before going to Eton. His mother died when he was a teenager, however, and he returned to his native Scotland to look after the family business. In 1910, Keiller was one of the early British exponents of ski jumping and, although he did not have an outstanding skiing or ski jumping career, hewas a fine administrator of the sport. In 1926 he founded the British Ski-jumping Club and was its first president. He was also president of the Ski Club of Great Britain for a while. In 1928 Keiller wrote The Ski-ing Events at the Winter Olympic Games, 1928 which was published by the British Ski-jumping and Langlaud Clubs, and was the first work of its kind in Britain. Having served with the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve, and then the Royal Naval Air Service, during World War I, Keiller was injured in 1915 and that year obtained his commercial pilot’s license. He later put it to good use because, with his friend “OGS” Crawford, they became aerial photographers and recorded archaeological sites across the Wessex landscape, and in 1924 published a book entitled Wessex from the Air. This interest resulted in Keiller purchasing and excavating Avebury, Wiltshire, one of Britain’s leading prehistoric sites. Throughout the 1920s and 30s, the site was restored by Keiller, a self-taught architect who became a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries (F.S.A.). Many of the Bronze Age artifacts he found can be seen at the Alex Keiller Museum, including a 3,500-year-old monument. He is also known to have discovered the bones of the earliest domesticated dog in England. Keiller eventually sold the site to the National Trust for a nominal fee, and in the 1980s Avebury was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Kieller died in 1955 at Telegraph Cottage, Kingston Hill, Surrey, which was used as a secret HQ of General Eisenhower for a while during World War II.",Nephew of Keiller Greig

Prokopenko rose into fame in 1960 when he won his first Soviet title and was selected to the Soviet 1960 Olympic team. At the Olympics Prokopenko was not very successful, only reaching the semifinals of the 200 metre breaststroke. At his next major international tournament, however, the 1962 European Championships, Prokopenko won the 200 breaststroke title, which he successfully defended in 1966.

At the Olympics, however, Prokopenko had to settle for silver behind Australian Ian O’Brien, who broke the world record.

It was always his intention to join the Army but, after taking up cycling and winning the Westerham Hill Climb in 1877, the sport was in his blood and in the 1880s he had a cycle business. He took up motoring seriously the following decade and in 1898 he purchased the famous Panhard and Levassor No.8 which had won the Paris-Marseille race two years earlier. Edge encouraged Montague Napier to go into car production and in 1900 the first Napier 9 horsepower (hp). vehicle was built under the supervision of Edge. In 1902 Edge won the Gordon Bennett Cup for Britain as the only finisher in the race from Paris to Innsbruck. In 1904 Napier built one of the first 18 hp. six cylinder vehicles, and by 1907 when the Brooklands track has opened, Napier had produced a 60 hp model which Edge drove around the track for 24 hours at an average speed of more than 65 mph. Napier and Edge were also involved in motor-boat racing until 1912 when Edge sold out his interest in Napier. Edge agreed that he would not take any part in the motor business for seven years, so he turned his attention to a new form of free range pig breeding, in which his animals roamed freely over large areas of land, and in clean and comfortable surroundings.",

His obituary in The Times noted that he could “paint pictures which have a certain individual charm.” Among these were Luxembourg Gardens and A la Crémerie, Rassay. Wood exhibited mostly in London. One of Woods’ paintings, Figures in a Country Park, featured in an episode of the BBC television programme “Bargain Hunt Road Trip” in 2012.

She and her teammates had trained locally in their native Pavia and had few resources, but had nonetheless qualified to represent Italy at the Games. Upon their return, they were congratulated personally by Benito Mussolini. This was her only major achievement in the sport and, with no professional opportunities, she gave up the sport several years after the Games. Marangoni eventually studied to be an accountant, working for the Pavia Transportation Department before and during World War II. It was this occupation that led to her being one of the first women in Italy to obtain a driver’s license. At some point, she lost her Olympic medal. While one of her teammates, Bianca Ambrosetti, died very young, Marangoni lived to be the last-known surviving competitor from the 1928 Summer Games, outliving even the last-known survivor of the 1932 edition, Simone Schaller.

42384,Philip Neame,Male,12 December 1888,,, Great Britain,GBR,"On leaving Cheltenham College, Philip Neame went to the RMA Woolwich and was commissioned into the Royal Engineers in 1908 which marked the start of an outstanding military career. In December 1914 he won the Victoria Cross at Neuve Chappelle, two years later he was awarded DSO and after filling various commands with distinction attained the rank of lieutenant general in 1940. He was knighted in 1946, while serving as Lieutenant-Governor of Guernsey from 1945-53. Neame was a final all-round sportsman, his interest embracing not only target shooting but also hockey, mountaineering, polo, hunting, skiing and big game shooting. None of these sports made excessive demands on his time to be the detriment of the others and he looked on each strictly as a pastime. In fact, his autobiography, which he wrote in captivity before escaping from an Italian prisoner of war camp, reveals that at the 1924 Olympic Games he was under the impression that he was representing the British Empire rather than Great Britain. Unlike his teammates in the running deer, double shot, team event, who defeated Norway by a single point, Neame did not take part in any other event at the Paris Olympics but he has the distinction of being the only man to win an Olympic gold medal and be awarded the Victoria Cross. Neame was a versatile shot and represented the Army in both revolver and rifle competitions. Although overseas postings meant that his appearances at Bisley were spasmodic, he reached the King’s final in 1929. Like many other Olympians, it was a love of sport that led Philip Neame into matrimony but the particular circumstance of his meeting his future wife are, fortunately, not commonplace. After being badly mauled by a tiger while big game hunting in India he married Miss Alberta Drew who nursed him in the hospital.",

Born near Franconia, New Hampshire, in a cabin with no indoor plumbing or electricity, he earned a scholarship to Carrabassett Valley Academy, a ski academy in Maine. Known for his wild style, described often as reckless, Miller won two silver medals at the 2002 Winter Olympics, shortly after winning his first World Cup race in December 2001. Unusual in that he skis almost all the events, Miller has been overall World Cup champion in both 2005 and 2008, and has won six year-end World Cup discipline championships – combined in 2003, 2004, and 2008; giant slalom in 2004; and Super-G in 2005 and 2007 – and through 2008 he has won 31 World Cup races. At the World Championships, Miller has won four titles – two in 2003 in the giant slalom and combined, and two in 2005 in the downhill and Super-G, in addition to a Super-G silver medal in 2003. But Miller has always generated press with his attitude that smacks of “don’t care” and is definitely a free spirit. In a 60 Minutes interview in January 2006, he admitted to racing many times while “wasted” (drunk). He was then blasted by the American media when he performed poorly at the Torino Winter Olympics in 2006. In 2007, Miller left the US Ski Team to ski on his own internationally, forming Team America for the 2008 season. Though he had struggled in 2006-07, the new team seemed to work for him, as he came back to win the 2008 overall World Cup title and won seven World Cup races in the 2007-08 season.","Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the World Alpine Ski Championships (4–1–0 2003 St. Moritz gold: giant slalom and combined, silver: Super G; 2005 Bormio gold: downhill and Super G) Listed in Olympic Alpine Skiers - Gold Medalists and World Champions; Same Discipline - Different Event (Combined: Olympic Gold - 2010, World Champion - 2003)"

But his win was derided by the European downhillers, who claimed he was only a glider, with no technical skills. But the Sarajevo downhill was also relatively non-technical and Johnson boldly predicted he would win, and repeated his victory there to become the first American to win an Olympic downhill gold medal, and the first American man to win an Olympic skiing gold medal. When asked what the victory meant to him, the brash, cocky Johnson replied, “Millions!” He won two more World Cup downhills in March 1984 and his future looked bright. But the years ahead would not be as golden for Johnson. He had been a troubled youth who had troubles with the law when he was only 17, and he would never realize those millions. After 1984, he never again stood on the podium in a major international ski race, his best finishes in the World Cup being two seventh places – one in 1985 and one in 1986. He did not make the 1988 US Olympic team and he was off the circuit by 1990. Personally, Johnson suffered as well. In 1992, his 13-month-old son drowned in a hot tub accident. Shortly after that his marriage crumbled and he was left bankrupt, living in a motor home. His only salvation were his skis and he tried a comeback in 2000 to attempt to make the 2002 Olympic team. On 22 March 2002 he crashed at the US Championships near Whitefish, Montana. He sustained a significant closed head injury with permanent brain damage, and was in a coma for three weeks.

The son of a civil servant of the former Austro-Hungary administration, he began athletics as a discus thrower and hurdler with the club Giovinezza Trieste. He was named to the Italian national team in 1933 and set his first national record with 46.437 at Trieste on 29 October in the discus. He eventually set 10 national records in the discus, and was the first Italian to better 50 metres with 50.317 on 29 June 1936 at Bologna. At the Berlin Olympics a month later, Oberweger took the bronze medal with 49.23 behind the Americans Ken Carpenter and Gordon Dunn. In 1937 Oberweger returned to Giovinezza Trieste after earning a law degree at the University of Bologna. He collaborated with newspapers and magazines and became a top assistant to the Italian technical coach, the American Boyd Comstock. Oberweger started an import-export business and, for a short while, worked as a lawyer. In 1938 he placed second in the discus at the European Championships. Later that year he ran 14.7 in the 110 hurdles for an Italian national record. In 1938, Oberweger improved his national record to 51.49. In World War II Oberweger was a fighter pilot, flying over England and Africa, and he was awarded a Military valour silver medal for bravery. In 1942 he moved to Roma for military work, where he became the manager at the Bruno Mussolini Club, one of the most important athletics clubs in Roma, which was dedicated to the son of the Duce who had died in August 1941 in an aviation crash. After the war Oberweger began a small textile factory, the Venjulia, along with another Olympian Ottavio Missoni. In 1946 Oberweger was appointed head coach of the Italian National team, serving until 1961, when he became vice-president of the Italian Athletics Federation. At the 1948 London Olympics he competed in discus but did not advance from qualifying, but he was responsible for coaching Adolfo Consolini and Giuseppe Tosi to gold and silver in the discus. Oberweger earned 17 international caps. Oberweger was again Italian coach from 1964-68, also serving during that time as a member of the IAAF Council and President of the International Commission on race walking. Until 1972 he also worked also at the Italian Central School of Sport.

920235,Anne Marie Carl-Nielsen,Female,21 June 1863,,, Denmark,DEN,"The main themes of Anne Marie Carl-Nielsen as a sculptor were realistic sculptures of domestic animals and expressive portraits of humans in motion and emotions. She was married to the famous Danish composer Carl Nielsen (e.g. the “Helios Overture”), whose first and last name she took as her own surname. She had studied at the Drawing and Art Academy for Women and later at the Art Academy, both in København. Supported by a scholarship of the Academy, she travelled to Paris and later to Italy and Greece, where she copied antique sculptures. Her work consisted of around 1,000 sculptures and more than 750 sketch drawings. Influenced by Art Nouveau and like many of the artists of that time she was inspired by the great French sculptor Auguste Rodin. Her daughter Anne Marie Telmányi became a well-known paintress. Carl-Nielsen received several prestigious awards including the Thorvaldsen Medal and is considered one of Denmark’s outstanding sculptors. According to the catalog raisonné, the works submitted in 1932 date from the period 1917-30. Except for the figures Dancer and Race Walker made of silver, all others were made of bronze: The three bronzes Kuglestøder (Shot Putter) date from the year 1917 and are 12-15 cm large. In the 1920s Langdistanceløber (Runner (long distance), 15 cm), 300 meters start (Runner (starting for 300 m race), 10x12 cm), Diskoskaster (Disc Thrower, 17 cm) and To brydere (Wrestler Attacking I and II, both about 13 cm) were generated. Less straightforward is the allocation of the Young Wrestler at Rest (? Seated boy [Siddende dreng], 1908-10, 4.5 x 4.5 cm) and the Woman Swimmer (? Girl ready to jump into the water [Pige parat til udspring], approx. 1910, 9.5 x 6 cm). The 17 cm high Kapgænger from the 1920s and the 16 cm high statuette Rytmisk dans from 1915 are only mentioned in the catalog raisonné as bronzes. It has not yet been clarified whether the latter is identical to the En Danser mentioned elsewhere. The work submitted in 1936 was the figure of the royal son Uffe hin Spage from 1927, listed in the catalog as Hero of Nordic Saga, which has been in the Kolding Bypark since 1932. His face and upper body are said to be based on the model of the Danish shot putter Frode Moesgaard. There is also a 17 cm high statuette of Uffe from 1929.",

He was the son of classical sculptor Andrew O’Connor, Sr. (1846-1924), who taught his son the basic concepts of the art. Andrew O’Connor, Jr. developed a vigorous and realistic style of sculpture. He began his studies in America with apprenticeships to William Ordway Partridge (1861-1930) and Daniel Chester French (1850-1931), before setting sail for Europe. One of his first European influences was the painter John Singer Sargent (1856-1925), whose works O’Connor saw during a stay in England between 1894 and 1897. After the turn of the century, Andrew O’Connor, Jr. settled in Paris with his wife Jessie and their four sons Hector, Owen, Roderic and Patrick who were also noted artists and sculptors. There he became influenced by the work of Auguste Rodin, whom he befriended. In the 1930s the family moved to Dublin, Ireland. The life-size bronze figure group The Spirit of Youth (Boy Scout) was created by O’Connor for the grounds of the Glenview Club near Chicago. The sculpture was erected in 1919 and is still there as of 2020. It was commissioned by club member and steel trader Edwin Stanton Jackman (1865-1927) and commemorates the close connection of the US President Theodore Roosevelt (1858-1919) to the Boy Scout movement.

In 2001 they won a decisive victory at the World Championships and the next year recorded a rare double by winning world titles at both coxed and coxless pairs in the same year. They were strong favourites for the Athens Olympics but a crushing defeat at the 2003 World Championships forced a radical rethink of their plans and they moved back into the four for the 2004 season. The crew struggled with illness and injury prior to Athens but in the Olympic final they held out for victory by a miniscule 0.08 seconds over a fast charging Canadian crew. This race was the last of Cracknell’s career and he soon moved into a career in the media. He became a television presenter and newspaper columnist as well as a fundraiser for various charities by competing in extreme physical challenges. He took part in the 2005-6 Atlantic Rowing Race, the London and New York Marathons, the Amundsen Race to the South Pole and the Sahara Desert based Marathon des Sables (the so-called “World’s toughest race”) as well as completing marathon cycling and canoeing events. In July 2010 Cracknell was attempting to run, cycle, swim and row from Los Angeles to New York in 16 days when he was found comatose on a desert highway near Winslow, Arizona, He had suffered a traumatic brain injury probably as a result of being side-swiped by the wing mirror of a passing petrol tanker. He has made a strong recovery from his injuries. In 2018, Cracknell enrolled at Cambridge University to study for a Masters degree in human evolution and made a return to rowing which culminated in a winning appearance in the 2019 Oxford-Cambridge boat race. At 46 he was older than any other rower to ever take part by nearly a decade. He has a personal best in the marathon of 2:43:12 set at the age of 45.",Brother-in-law of Adrian Turner Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the Summer Universiade (0–1–0 1993 Buffalo ROW silver: lightweight eights) Listed in Olympians Who Competed in the Boat Race (2019 Cambridge (won))

He dominated the domestic scene for many years and won the AAA title five times (1922-23, 1925-27) and was second three times. He also won the “closed” English AAA title in the only three years it was held, 1923-25. On his championship début in 1921 he fell at the last hurdle in his heat when leading the ultimate winner, Henri Bernhard (FRA), and on his last final appearance in 1930, at the age of 35, he placed second to Lord Burghley. He closed his career with a bronze medal at the 1930 British Empire Games. He was the English AAA champion in each of the three years the Championships were held (1923-25) and a three-time winner in the Triangular International match (1921, 1925-26). He also had a record seven victories at the Kinnaird Meeting (1920-25, 1927). After serving as an airman in World War I, Gaby joined the Civil Service and a posting to the North of England, where the absence of his coach, Sam Mussabini, and of adequate training facilities, proved a major setback in his preparations for the 1924 Olympics. A one-time Post Office engineer, he later became a shoe repairer and the family shop at Parson’s Green, known simply as “Gaby’s”, was still in business at the time of his death.

Englund fought in Karelia in the war against the USSR and wrote his Symphony No. 1 (War symphony) under these impressions. He was the first Finnish composer who wrote orchestral music influenced by modern composers like the Shostakovich and Prokofiev. In the late 1940s and early 1950s he made study trips to the Russia, Bulgaria, and the United States, where he worked with Aaron Copland. He resolutely opposed the influences of 12-tone music, however, and did not compose for years. After his wife’s death in 1956 he also created stage and film music. From 1957-81 he worked as a teacher and then a professor of music theory and composition at the Sibelius Academy. At times, he also worked as an entertainment musician and jazz pianist as well as a music critic for a newspaper in Helsinki.

Herbert came from the Ozarks in Arkansas, not exactly a hotbed of US canoeing, but his legendary work ethic and strength took him to the top levels of US kayaking. He paddled for the US at the 1988, 1992, and 1996 Olympics. Herbert won three medals at the World Championships, with two silvers in 1990, and a bronze in 1989. He also won six medals, including three golds, at the Pan American Games, competing in 1987, 1991, and 1995. During his racing career he won 27 US Championships. Known for his bodybuilder physique, Herbert continued to compete in canoe marathons after his prime racing career ended. Even into his late 50s he worked out almost every day, and was once described as “muscles bulging off of other muscles.” Herbert is perhaps best remembered for the time he wrestled a bear. In 1985, at a Tulsa, Oklahoma nightclub, Herbert took up an offer to wrestle Victor the Bear, a 700-pounder who was promoted by Tuffy Truesdell. The promotion offered a Camaro Z-28 to anyone who could defeat the bear, which was declawed and wrestled with a muzzle. Herbert heard about the promotion and drove from his home in Arkansas to Tulsa for the match. Two others went before Herbert and failed to flip the bear, but Herbert pinned Victor in only a few seconds. The Camaro never materialized, as Truesdell demanded a re-match, which did not occur, but the match is not forgotten in the US kayaking world.","Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the Summer Pan American Games (3–3–0 1987 Indianapolis CAN gold: K2 500 m and K4 1000 m; 1991 La Habana CAN gold: K1 1000 m, silver: K1 500 m; 1995 Mar del Plata CAN silver: K4 500 m and K4 1000 m) Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the Canoe Sprint World Championships (0–2–1 1989 Plovdiv bronze: K1 500 m; 1990 Poznań silver: K1 500 m and K2 500 m)"

In 1938 he was arrested by the Gestapo for a short time because he had criticized the regime, but he created Hitler busts in 1941 and 1943, shown at the Great German Art Exhibitions.

In his youth he performed in vaudeville with his brother. He studied first at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts in Philadelphia, and later in Germany, London, and Paris. Returning to the United States in 1894, he became an illustrator for the “Philadelphia Press”. Luks went to Cuba in 1895 as a correspondent artist for the “Philadelphia Bulletin” during the Cuban struggle for independence from Spain. After returning to the United States, he settled in New York and worked as a cartoonist, drawing the popular cartoon Hogan’s Alley for the “New York World”. From 1902-03 Luks lived in Paris, where he not only continued his art studies but also became increasingly preoccupied with the depiction of modern city life. When he returned to New York City, he settled in Greenwich Village, where he began to paint realistic pictures of New Yorkers. He developed into a chronicler of the poor, having been acquainted with poverty in his youth, and painted mainly workers and subcultural city scenes. In 1908, with seven other painters, Luks formed a group called The Eight, whose exhibition in New York that year marked a key event in the history of modern painting in the United States. After this event, Luks received the support of art dealers and patrons. He and the other members of The Eight were eventually absorbed into a larger group of artists known as the Ashcan school, which continued the exploration of modern, urban realities. A heavy drinker, Luks considered himself as a rebel against the establishment, but nevertheless taught at the Art Students League in the 1920s and then at his own art school. In 1933, he was found dead in the street after getting heavily drunk in his local bar and getting into a fight. With his painting The Wrestlers (oil on canvas, 122.5 x 168.3 cm), which was painted as early as 1905, he wanted to silence his critics, who accused him of not being able to depict human anatomy well. The painting is now in the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston.",

In preparation for the major leagues he suited up with the American Hockey League’s Adirondack Red Wings (1989-1992) and the International Hockey League’s San Diego Gulls (1990-1992).

Upon his return he finished out the 1993-1994 season with the Ottawa Senators, playing the only 17 games of his NHL career.

After going up to Jesus College, Cambridge, he followedthe family rowing tradition, as his uncle Steven Fairbairn was a four-time Cambridge Blue, and was responsible for developing the “Fairbairn Style” of rowing. Eric won his Blue in 1908, when he rowed at number four in the Cambridge crew that won in the fastest time since 1902. He was scheduled to win his second Blue in 1909 but had to pull out due to an injury a week before the race. He did, however, win that second Blue in 1911 but sadly Oxford won the race in a time of 18:29, which was not bettered until 1934. Selected for the Great Britain eights at the 1908 Olympics, for reasons unknown he lost his place in the boat and was replaced by fellow Jesus man, and former Cambridge President, Henry Goldsmith. The eight won the bronze medal while Fairbairn won the silver in the coxless pairs after teaming up with Philip Verdon. Shortly before the Olympics, Fairbairn won the Senior Sculls Challenge Cup at the Marlow Regatta. Fairbairn rowed at stroke in the Jesus College crew beaten in the final of the Grand Challenge Cup at Henley by the Belgian Royal Club Nautique de Gand in 1909 and, the following year, Jesus were beaten in the final again, this time by Magdalen, Oxford. Fairbairn was also a first class rugby player and often wore the colours of Rosslyn Park RUFC. The day after World War I broke out, Fairbairn enlisted before obtaining a commission into the 10th battalion, Durham Light Infantry. He was sent to France on 22 May 1915 and, a month later, was badly injured while fighting on the front line, when hit by shrapnel from a grenade. He died from his wounds later that same day.","Cousin of Ian Fairbairn Listed in Olympians Who Competed in the Boat Race (1908 Cambridge (won), 1911 Cambridge (lost)) Listed in Olympians Who Were Killed or Missing in Action or Died as a Result of War (†20 June 1915.

He followed that with some good domestic successes including the 1968 Hereford Two-day race. He took part in his first Tour of Britain (Milk Race) in 1970 and finished a creditable sixth, and was the highest placed British rider. The following year, Edwards won 14 races on home soil and won the sixth stage of the Milk Race. After winning the third stage of the 1972 Milk Race he became the first Briton since 1967 to be the overall leader of the race. Unfortunately he could only finish fourth overall. He spent the 1974 season racing in Italy after his Italian-born mother wrote to several Italian teams asking to give her son a chance to race abroad. It paid off, and Edwards won seven races that season before turning professional the following year with the Italian G.S. Mobigori-Perigano team, before joining the the crack Sanson team, led by Francesco Moser, at the end of 1975. Ironically, in the road race at the 1972 Olympics, Edwards finished sixth and Moser eighth. Edwards won the 1977 London to York Elite Road Race and followed that with the National Road Race Championship, 10 years after winning the junior event. It turned out to be his last victory on British soil, but he continued to play his part in helping Moser win major races across Europe. A bad injury during the 1980 season, however, led to Edwards making the decision to quit the sport at the age of 31 and he went into business with his brother Mark. They imported Italian cycle brands into Britain and in 1985 they introduced specialist mountain bikes into the Italian market. Phil eventually retired from business in 2010. He continued riding casually but on medical advice he gave up riding and took to walking around Monaco, where he had made his home. He would occasionally stop for a coffee at the La Grote pizzeria in Roquebrune-Cap-Martin in the mountains overlooking Monaco. He loved the place so much that he bought the restaurant and was still running it at the time of his sudden death in 2017.",

In 1941 Baier and Herber were married, but they divorced in 1964. After World War II they skated in ice revues and built up an own revue which they later sold to “Holiday on Ice.” As a result of the divorce, she had to depend on social services to survive, and suffered from Parkinson’s disease in her later years.

Against the customs of the time she was allowed to pursue academics as well as a swimming career. She entered Sugiyama Girls’ School and the school provided full support, building a new pool. In 1931 both her parents died within a period of six months from strokes. After winning “only” the silver medal in Los Angeles, just 1/10th second behind Australian Claire Dennis, she was criticized by the Tokyo mayor, as at the time Tokyo was bidding to host the Olympic Games. Instead of retiring from competition Maehata underwent a strenuous training program leading to a world record of 3:00.4, set in September 1933. In 1936 she eventually won the gold medal in Berlin, beating local favorite and European Champion Martha Genenger, and becoming Japan’s first female Olympic champion. The radio broadcast of her victory is still legendary although it was past midnight local time in Japan. During World War II, her gold medal was destroyed during an air raid. At home, she won the Japan Swimming Championships in the 200 m breaststroke seven consecutive times, from 1930-36. In 1937 Maehata married a professor of medicine but continued to promote swimming while living in Gifu. She met Martha Genenger 41 years after their competition in Berlin and went swimming with her. Like her parents, Maehata sustained a stroke in 1983 but returned to the pool for rehabilitation. At the age of 80 years Maehata died of acute kidney failure. She was inducted into the International Swimming Hall of Fame in 1979 and was also highly decorated in Japan, for instance she was awarded the Medal of Honor with Purple Ribbon. She also was an enthusiastic player of the Japanese game of Mah-jong.","Listed in Olympians Who Set a World Record in Long Course Swimming (200 m breaststroke – 30 September 1933 - 11 May 1937: 3:00.4 (30 September 1933; Tokyo, JPN)) Listed in Olympians With Asteroids Named After Them (9870 Maehata) Listed in Olympic Order Recipients (1981 (Silver))"

A second year in the boat was more successful as they won a bronze medal at the World Championship but their momentum was checked in 2004 and they did not reach the final of the Olympic Games. Things then changed drastically for him as first he returned to education, studying as a postgraduate at Oxford University, where he became a rowing Blue in 2005, and then was chosen as one of the newly constituted Great Britain coxless four crew with an eye to competing at the Beijing Olympics. The four had two excellent years in 2005 and 2006 and won the world title on both occasions but an up-and-down 2007 saw them miss out completely on the medal positions. The Olympic year of 2008 saw them eventually return to top form and they won the Olympic gold by overhauling the Australian crew with a late race burst of power. For the next Olympic cycle Triggs Hodge was paired with Pete Reed in the coxless pair and from 2009 to 2011 they continuously battled the New Zealanders Hamish Bond and Eric Murray for the world title, finishing second to them each time.

14527,Compton Gonsalves,Male,11 December 1926,,, Trinidad and Tobago,TTO,"Compton Gonsalves’ cycling career began on a borrowed bicycle at Saint Mary’s College, Trinidad and Tobago in 1945 and, within a year, he was competing internationally for his country, winning a bronze medal in the 4000m team pursuit at the fifth Central American and Caribbean Games. Upon his return he founded the Saddle Boys Cycle Club and, the following year, won the national cycling championship, capturing five events, placing second in a sixth, and establishing records in the ½ and 15 mile races. His success continued throughout the year until he abruptly gave up the sport and moved to England. He decided to return after a ten-month hiatus, in the hopes of winning a medal at the 1948 Summer Olympics, but his absence took its toll on his skills and he finished joint 16th out of 21 competitors in the 1000m time trial and was eliminated in the first round of the sprint. In 1949 Gonsalves teamed up with 1948 cycling alternate Ferdi de Gannes to remove cycling from the aegis of the Amateur Athletic Association, which in turn was controlled by Trinidad Leaseholds Ltd. Their national and international legal struggle eventually culminated in the founding of the Trinidad and Tobago Cycling Federation in 1951, but both men had lost significant time on their athletic careers. Gonsalves still managed to compete successfully, however, winning silver and bronze medals in the 1000m match sprint and 100m time trial events respectively at the 1950 Central American and Caribbean Games. He raced his final major international races at the 1951 World Championships prior to pursuing sports administration and eventually assuming the presidency of the Cycling Federation that he had fought to create. In April 2010 his home country held the first annual Compton Gonsalves All Star Invitational 300 Metre Power Sprint in his honor.","Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the Central American and Caribbean Games (0–1–2 1946 Barranquilla CYC bronze: 4000 m pursuit team; 1950 Ciudad de Guatemala CYC silver: sprint, bronze: 1000 m time trial)"

While a decent sprinter and high hurdler at Cambridge University, where he majored in agriculture and forestry, Tisdall had never contested the event until, early in 1932, he asked the president of the Irish NOC to send him to Los Angeles for that event. He met the qualifying standard in his second attempt, winning the Irish championship in the event. In 1931 Tisdall had won four events in the Oxbridge meet – the 440 yards, long jump, shot put, and 120 yard hurdles. He was Irish champion in the 120 yard hurdles in 1930 and in the 440 yards hurdles in 1932, but he was not considered of world caliber. But once in Los Angeles, Tisdall was unbeatable. In the final, he even bettered the world record to win the gold medal. He received the medal, but not the record, as Tisdall had knocked over the final hurdle, which was not allowed by the rules of the day for record purposes. Born in Sri Lanka, raised in Ireland and educated in England, Tisdall emigrated to South Africa at the end of 1933 and while there helped to form the South African-Irish Regiment during World War II. He later lived in Northern Rhodesia (Zambia), Kenya and Tanzania before returning to Ireland and eventually settling in Nambour, in Queensland, Australia.

Educated at Eton College, he won a scholarship to King’s College, Cambridge, where he took a double first in economics. At Cambridge, he won a half-blue at fencing, and that was to be the beginning of a successful fencing career. Brook was appointed captain of the British sabre team in 1933, and they finished third at the European Championships that year. He was the British sabre champion in 1936, and competed at the Berlin Olympics, where he refused to salute, or march past, Hitler. Brook competed in his second Olympics at London in 1948. During World War II, Brook worked for the Ministry of Economic Warfare, before transferring to the Special Operations Executive (SOE), where he worked behind enemy lines, engaging in what became known as a “secret war”, working on SOE intelligence. In 1944 he worked alongside General Eisenhower at Supreme Allied Headquarters. In the latter part of the War, Brook joined the British Rhine Army and served as a brigadier. Having previously been mentioned in dispatches, he was honoured with the OBE in 1945, as well as receiving most of the leading overseas awards, including the French and Belgium Croix de Guerre, the French Légion d’Honneur and the American Legion of Honour. In 1946 Brook was appointed a director of the newly nationalised Bank of England at the age of 37. At the same time, he also worked for the Secret Intelligence Service (MI6), until the late 1950s. He served on many committees and was president of the London Chamber of Commerce between 1966-72.

He was born in Le Havre in France and his tea merchant father was a friend of such well known Paris painters as Dufy, Money, Pissarro and Renoir. The young Maze learnt the art of painting under the guidance of some of France’s finest artists. In 1899 Maze moved to Southampton in England to further his education and his love of England became an inspiration behind many of his paintings. During World War I he served with the French Army, but was attached to the Scots Greys after they landed at Le Havre and he became an interpreter and artist. During the war he met Winston Churchill and, sharing their love of painting, Maze helped Churchill with his hobby and became a mentor to him. Maze and the great man became lifelong friends. Maze became a naturalised British citizen in 1920 and many of his works subsequently depicted events in his newly adopted country, including the Funeral of George VI, Henley Royal Regatta, Glorious Goodwood, Cowes Week and the Trooping of the Colour. Having painted the funeral of King George VI in 1952, he was appointed the Official Painter of Queen Elizabeth II’s Coronation the following year. Maze served with the British Army in the Second World War with the Home Guard before becoming the personal Staff Officer to “Bomber” Harris, Air Officer Commander-in-Chief RAF Bomber Command. Maze retired from the Army in 1945 having been honoured with the Distinguished Conduct Medal and Military Medal and bar by the British, and the Croix de Guerre and Légion d’honneur by the French. Harris, like Churchill, became a lifelong friend of Maze’s. A master at pastel painting, Maze also worked with oils and watercolours and his paintings appeared at exhibitions in all the world’s great cities including London, Paris and New York. Maze died in 1979 with a pastel in his hand looking out onto his beloved Sussex Downs. He was described as the last of the Impressionists and his life and friendships were recorded in his biography by Anne Singer entitled Paul Maze – the Lost Impressionist published in 1983. Cowes Roads is the water off the mouth of the River Medina, where the town of Cowes is located. There is a painting by Maze entitled Isle of Wight Ferry Passing Through Cowes Roads. This is a watercolor, however, while the entry in the catalog suggests it to be an oil painting. Among his few oil paintings of the town is Cowes (oil on wood, 68.5 x 63.5). Watercolors showing Racing Yachts at Cowes are too numerous to identify the one submitted. That painting was owned by the Earl of Sandwich, who was another friend of Maze. The lender of Cowes Roads was his son, the Viscount Hinchingbrooke.",

He then placed disappointing 24th at the 1924 Paris Olympics in the middleweight class as he had no valid lift in the one-hand clean & jerk element. Edinger set two middleweight world records in the press in 1926 and 1927. Edinger trained as a butcher and over took his father’s butchery business after his premature death. In 1937 Edinger founded his own butchers. In 1942 he was drafted by the German Wehrmacht and fought in World War II. After the war he built up a new butchery at Wien (Vienna) out of a derelict building.,

Shortly after the end of the war, he died of cancer, which was complicated by pneumonia. Much of his work was donated to the Antwerp Zoological Society, where Ost had regularly displayed his works. The motif of Ost’s poster “De Voetballer” dates back to 1910. It is said to have been influenced by a match between Northern Nomads, a team from the area between Manchester and Liverpool, and Belgium’s Union Saint-Gilloise, which the English team won 2-0 in the final of an international tournament in Bruxelles.
