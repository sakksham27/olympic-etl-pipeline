81819,Antoinette Meyer,Female,19 June 1920,,, Switzerland,SUI,"Antoinette Meyer worked in her parent’s hotel in her youth, which left her plenty of time to hone her alpine skiing skills, as the hotel was closed during the winter. The Swiss national skiing federation took notice of her in 1942 and, one year later, offered her a spot on the national team. After earning four national titles in the downhill (1943), slalom (1944, 1945), and combined (1945) in the 1940s, she was selected for Switzerland’s delegation to the 1948 Winter Olympics, where she won a silver medal in the slalom, half a second behind gold medalist Gretchen Fraser of the United States. Meyer was also 11th in the downhill at these Games. By the end of the year she had retired from active competition and married Karl Molitor, who had captured two alpine skiing medals at the 1948 Games. They settled in Wengen and opened a sports shop, which they ran together until 1987, at which point they passed the business on to their son. Meyer continued to ski into her late 80s and was also active in golf.",Wife of Karl Molitor Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the World Alpine Ski Championships (0–1–0 1948 St. Moritz (Olympics) silver: slalom)

Pretty’s next stop was the 1958 British Empire and Commonwealth Games, where he won a gold medal in the eights with a crew coxed by Sohen Biln. He later qualified for the 1964 Summer Olympics in the coxless pairs with Roger Jackson, but was moved to the eights after George Hungerford came down with mononucleosis and was unable to compete. Although the eights crew finished ninth at the Games, Hungerford replaced Pretty in the pairs and, despite Hungerford’s illness and inexperience in the event, he and Jackson defeated favorites Steven Blaisse and Ernst Veenemans of the Netherlands to win Canada’s only gold medal of the tournament. Pretty took up coaching after his retirement from active competition, most notably at the 1967 Pan American Games, where he guided Canada’s rowers to four silver medals. He has been inducted into the Canadian Olympic (1958), British Columbia Sports (1976), and University of British Columbia Sports (2010) Halls of Fame as a member of his silver medal-winning crew.",Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the British Empire/Commonwealth Games (1–0–0 1958 Cardiff ROW gold: eights)

71764,Gabre Gabric-Calvesi,Female,14 October 1917,,, Italy,ITA,"Gabre Gabric was born in the town of Imotski in what was then Austro-Hungary and is now Croatia. At a young age she moved to the United States and lived in Chicago for several years before returning to the modern-day Croatian city of Zadar, which had become part of Italy following the First World War. During all these travels her official birthdate became muddled as a transcription error listed her year of birth as 1914, a date that would stick well into her masters-level athletic career. Gabric took up the discus throw in 1934 and, by 1936, she was good enough to participate at that year’s Summer Olympic Games in Berlin where, despite finishing 10th in a field of 19 competitors, she broke Vittorina Vivenza’s Italian record in the event. Her next major stop was the 1938 European Championships, where she placed sixth, before setting a personal best of 43.35 in the event in 1939, which would have been sufficient for a bronze medal at the Berlin Olympics. Her career was interrupted by World War II but, between the 1936 and 1948 Summer Olympics, she was crowned Italian Champion four times (1937, 1939, 1940, 1942). At the London Games, however, she slipped to 17th out of 21 competitors. Her final major international competition was the 1950 European Championships, where she finished seventh. Gabric married Sandro Calvesi, a hurdler, and their daughter, Lyana, married Eddy Ottoz, who had been coached by Calvesi and won a bronze medal in the 110 metres hurdles event at the 1968 Summer Olympics. Lyana and Eddy had a son, Laurent, who participated in the 1992 and 1996 Summer Games. It was Gabric, however, who would outlast them all in the athletic realm. A long-time competitor in masters-level athletics, she won numerous European and World Masters Championships in the shot put, discus throw, and javelin.

Four years later, Frigerio was still clearly the fastest, demolishing the field in the 10 km by half a lap (the 3 km had been discontinued).

Yamanaka was also unlucky that his perhaps best event, the 200 metre freestyle, was not on the Olympic program during his career. He recorded the fastest leg in the 4 x 200 freestyle relay at the 1960 Olympics, but could not prevent a US victory in world record time. At his last Olympics, Yamanaka made his third consecutive 400 metre freestyle final, placing sixth, and swam in the preliminaries of the 4 x 200 free relay, but did not compete in the final, in which his teammates earned a bronze.

47414,Henry Taylor,Male,17 March 1885,165.0,66, Great Britain,GBR,"Henry Taylor’s total eight Olympic medals is a record for a British Olympian in any sport and his feat of winning a medal in the same event, the freestyle relay, at four successive Games remains unique in British Olympic history. Born in poor circumstances, Taylor worked in the mills in his native Lancashire and trained in the canals and streams around his work-place. He only used the local swimming baths on “dirty water day” when admission was cheaper. As it happened, this proved to be an admirable preparation for the 1906 Olympics in Athens where the swimming events were held in the open sea at Phalerum Bay. Taylor was the surprise of the games and won two gold medals, although he had yet to win an ASA title. On his return home he set about remedying this omission and by the end of the season he was the British champion at 400 yards, 500 yards, 880 yards and 1 mile. His winning time of 11:25.4 seconds for the 880 yards was recognized as the inaugural world record and he claimed further world records at the 1908 Olympics in the 800 metres and 1,500 metres. In all, Taylor won 15 ASA titles, the last being the long distance event in 1920 when he was 35 years old and still playing water polo for England. Having originally competed for Chadderton SC, he later joined the Hyde Seal Club.

After winning the 1982 World Cadets Championships and 1983 World Junior and 1984 European Junior Championships, Khabelovi made the Soviet national team in 1985 and immediately dominated in the senior ranks. After winning the 1985 and 1987 World Championships, and the 1985, 1987 and 1988 European Championships, Khabelovi was unanimously considered the main favorite for 1988 Olympic freestyle heavyweight gold. At the Olympics, however, after winning five matches, three of them by fall, Khabelovi unexpectedly lost to Romanian Vasile Puşcaşu by decision in the gold medal match and had to settle for a silver. After the 1988 Olympics, Kabelovi again established himself as the world’s best heavyweight freestyle wrestler by winning world titles in 1990-91 and the 1992 European title and again went to the Olympics as the favorite for freestyle heavyweight gold. This time, Khabelovi did not disappoint and won gold. After the fall of the Soviet Union, Khabelovi decided to represent Russia instead of his native Georgia and won the 1993 World title. After his 1993 victory, however, Khabelovi moved to the super-heavyweight class, but was not very successful. He won only bronze at the 1995 World and European Championships and decided to move back to heavyweight. As a heavyweight, Khabelovi was selected for the 1996 Russian Olympic team but, by then past his prime, he was eliminated early. Domestically, Khabelovi won Soviet titles in 1985, 1987 and 1988 and a Russian super-heavyweight title in 1993. Khabelovi retired from sports after the 1996 Olympics and moved back to his native Georgia. He was head coach of the Georgian national freestyle team and, from 2000-07, vice-president of the Georgian National Olympic Committee. From 1998-2004 he was deputy chairman of the sports department of the Georgian Ministry of Culture. In 2008 Khabelovi entered politics, but failed in a bid for the Georgian parliament. In 2012, however, he was elected to the Georgian parliament and became the chairman of the parliamentary Committee for Sport and Youth Affairs.

From 1891 Fraser was a sculptor’s student and attended courses at the Art Institute in Chicago. Five years later, he studied at the Académie Colarossi and the École des Beaux Arts in Paris. After returning to the USA, he opened a studio in New York and taught at the Art Students League. Fraser was one of the founders of the American Association of American Painters and Sculptors and president of the National Sculpture Society. Fraser became one of the most prominent American sculptors of the first half of the 20th century. One source of inspiration was his experience of the “Wild West” and the indigenous people in his youth. The 48 x 29 cm bronze plaque with the portrait of Henry Schoellkopf was created in 1916. It is located on the east wall of the Schoellkopf House at Cornell University. Henry Schoellkopf (1879-1912) came from an industrialists’ family of German descent.

In 1968, Henrichs returned and reached the final against Denmark in the same event, by then representing West Germany at Mexico City. West Germany always led and the race looked over when, after 9 of 12 laps, a Danish rider went off the back, however, they re-grouped although they still trailed on the bell lap. The German team then began to split, with Jürgen Kissner dropping off the pace. As his teammate Henrichs passed him, Kissner’s hand appeared to touch him, possibly giving him a slight push. Germany held on to win by 3½ seconds, but Kissner was an East German defector and East Germany immediately protested that the touch had been an illegal shove. After a 15-minute conference among the judges, West Germany was disqualified, and Italy and the Soviet Union were announced as the silver and bronze medal winners. FRG officials then protested, stating that Italy and the Soviets should not be placed ahead of their riders. Another long conference ensued, and the result was announced as Denmark 1st and Italy 3rd.

He did contest the professional singles and doubles (with Charles Hierons) at the 1900 Paris Olympics, and the pair finished third, out of three, losing their only match to the eventual champions Tom Burke and George Kerr. Fleming’s reputation, however, was as a leading coach rather that a player. He had a vast knowledge and understanding of the game and that is why he joined Queen’s Club. He later worked at the Roehampton Cub, where his star pupil was Kitty McKane, the 1924 and 1926 Wimbledon champion, and triple medallist at the 1920 Antwerpen Olympics. Like many top professionals just before and after World War I, Fleming coached in France and was in charge of the tennis courts at the Hotel Bristol, Beaulieu-sur-Mer on the French Riviera between Nice and Monte Carlo.

3222,Kris Benson,Male,7 November 1974,193.0,85, United States,USA,"Kris Benson was a solid right-handed starting pitcher who played in the Majors from 1999-2010. He also helped the USA win a bronze medal at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics. Benson played in college at Clemson from 1993-96. In his junior year he was named College Baseball Player of the Year and the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) Male Athlete of the Year. He led Clemson to the College World Series, during which time he was drafted by the Pittsburgh Pirates as the first overall pick of the 1996 MLB draft, and was given a then record signing bonus. Benson started in the minors, playing in 1997-98 for the Lynchburg Hillcats, Carolina Mudcats, and Nashville Sounds. He came up to the Pirates in 1999 and was an effective starting pitcher for them the entire season, placing fourth in the NL Rookie of the Year voting. His best season in the majors was 2000, when he struck out 184 in 32 games started, with an ERA of 3.85 and an ERA+ of 121. After that season he underwent Tommy John surgery and missed the 2001 season. He returned to the Pirates in 2002 and pitched for them through 2004, when he was traded to the New York Mets in mid-season. Benson played for the Mets in 2004-05 and was then with the Baltimore Orioles in 2006. He then underwent rotator cuff surgery and was out of baseball for two seasons. He came back and played in 2009-10 with the Texas Rangers and Arizona Diamondbacks, but was never again very effective. He injured his shoulder again in 2010 with the Diamondbacks, spent much of that year in the minors, and retired after the season. He finished major league ball with a career record of 70-75 in 200 starts. Benson made over $38 million in his career and was known for his charitable work. He was a quiet, almost studious type, which made his marriage in 1999 to Anna Adams somewhat incongruous. The couple met at a strip club in Atlanta, where she was working, while Benson was playing in the minors. They married in 1999 and they became well-known as a baseball couple, mostly for Anna Benson’s outrageous ways. Famously, after Kris Benson was traded to the Mets, she told Howard Stern during an interview on his radio show that if Kris ever cheated on her, she would sleep with every member of the Mets organization, though she did not term it quite so delicately. The couple did support numerous charities together, starting Benson’s Battalion, which raised funds for emergency services after 9/11. They also contributed to the Red Cross and United Way for 9/11 relief. They started a charity in 2005 called Tuesday’s Children, assisting children who lost parents in the Twin Tower tragedies. Kris Benson was later honored for his charitable and community services. He received the Pittsburgh Pirates team Roberto Clemente Award, the Thurman Munson Award, the Joan Payson Award, and the New Jersey Sports Writers Humanitarian of the Year Award. While in Baltimore he was recognized by the Baltimore Police Department for his support, and later received a Certificate of Appreciation from the US Armed Forces Central Command in Saudi Arabia. During his career it is estimated he contributed close to $1 million for charitable causes. He and Anna Benson divorced in 2006.",

His international debut, therefore, would have to wait two years until he ran the six mile race, finishing tenth, at the 1930 British Empire Games. At the 1931 Olympic trials he broke the course record and captured the marathon event, but again did not start in the competition at the 1932 Summer Olympics. His greatest victory came when he won the marathon at the 1934 British Empire Games and two years later he qualified for the Canadian Olympic delegation for a third time by winning the marathon event at the Olympic trials. At the 1936 Summer Olympic he finally became an official participant in the event, but was forced to drop out after nearly being hit by a car during the race, although he was not injured. From this point he entered into fewer and fewer competitions and, in 1943, retired from racing for good. He was inducted into the Canadian Olympic Hall of Fame in 1955 and died in November 1958 from head injuries sustained in a bicycle accident. An annual ten mile Boxing Day race in Hamilton, Ontario, his hometown, was named in his honor and the Harold Webster Trophy of the CANUSA Games is given every year to the player from the host city who displays athletic ability and the tournament’s philosophy. Outside of athletics, he had a career as a steel molder.

The favorite for the 1964 decathlon gold medal in Tokyo was expected to be Taiwan’s C. K. Yang, the 1960 silver medalist, but when the decathlon scoring tables were changed in 1962, Yang’s great advantage in the pole vault vanished, bringing Holdorf’s skills to the fore. Still, his Olympic gold medal was considered an upset and the first German decathlon gold at the Olympics. He was German decathlon Champion in 1961 and 1963, as well as in 1962 in the 200 hurdles. In 1964 he also placed fifth at the European Championships. Holdorf was named German Sportsman of the Year in 1964, received the Silver Bay Leaf, and later became a member of the German NOC in 1997.

Just one year earlier Thorén had won the Swedish pairs alongside Elna Montgomery.

921665,Ivan Zajec,Male,15 July 1869,,, Yugoslavia,YUG,"A Slovenian, Ivan Zajec was one of the most outstanding sculptors of the end of the 19th and the beginning of the 20th century. He was first trained by his father Franc Ksaver, the first academic sculptor in Slovenia. After completing his studies at the Academy of Vienna, Ivan Zajec continued his work there and in Ljubljana (previously Laibach). Since 1907 he spent several years abroad, in Paris, in the USA and in Italy. During World War I, he was interned in Sardinia. He then lived in Ljubljana again and taught at various universities beginning in the 1920s. A prolific sculptor, it is said that his works exceeded in number those of all other contemporary sculptors. He combined different styles and experiments with a variety of genres. His sculptures demonstrated certain features he had adopted during his travels to Italy, Munich, and Paris, where he became fascinated with the work of Auguste Rodin. The entered work could be the memorial in the central Serbian city of Svilajnac for those who were killed in the Balkan War and World War I. The monument was commissioned in 1923 and inaugurated in 1926. It shows a mythical female figure holding a torch in her right hand and a laurel branch in her left, so it fits both the time of its creation and the motif. As early as the 1930s, the sculpture was to be replaced by another due to alleged anti-monarchist symbolism. However, this did not happen, but in World War II, it was melted down by Serbian nationalists and turned into hand grenades. After the war it was restored by sculptor Lojze Dolinar using Zajec’s old molds and was inaugurated in 1951.",

However, after the family house was flattened during one of the many air-raids on the town (now a city), the family moved to Leicester and it was then that Yardley excelled as an all-round sportsman. He represented Leicester schools at football, cricket, and rugby, but it was at athletics that he stood out. He went on to make his Great Britain international début as an 18-year-old in 1959 and proudly wore the British vest for 11 years. He finished second in the AAAs 400 in 1959 and third in 1960, and at the Roma Olympics was the lead-off leg in the 4x400 metres relay team that missed out on a medal, finishing fifth. In 1961 the top-ranked 4x400 quartet in the world was Adrian Metcalfe, Barry Jackson, Robbie Brightwell, and Yardley. Yardley also competed in the individual 400 at Roma, but he would not take part in another Games, with injury depriving him at Tokyo in 1964 and Mexico City four years later. He was out of the sport from 1965-69 but came back to finish second in the AAAs 200 in 1969. Originally a member of Birchfield Harriers, he joined Blackburn Harriers when he moved back north to Burnley, and he overcame injuries to compete in the 1970 Commonwealth Games in Edinburgh where he competed in the individual 400 but failed to make a final that surprisingly contained no British runners. At the time of his death, Malcolm was reported to still hold the Blackburn Harriers 100, 200 and 400 metres records, set more than 50 years earlier. After ending his competitive career, Yardley was involved locally with Belvedere Sports Club, as trainer of the football team, and Lowerhouse Cricket Club as captain, manager, selector, trainer and member of the committee. He also designed training programmes for members of both clubs. He also helped out several local Football League clubs with training programmes, such as Burnley, Bury, Blackpool, and Rochdale. Yardley also established a local sports shop in the Burnley area in 1967 which was regularly frequented by members of the Burnley football squad. Personal Best: 400 – 46.6 (1960).",

He began his sporting career at the age of 12 and, from 1945 through 1947, he brought the Gordon Bell Panthers of Winnipeg, Manitoba to three consecutive provincial championships. Continuing his passion as an undergraduate at the University of Manitoba, he was the fourth-highest North American collegiate scorer in 1949 and 1950. Perhaps his best year, however, came in 1952 when he was selected to help represent Canada at the 1952 Summer Olympics and offered a contract to play for the NBA’s Milwaukee Hawks (now the Atlanta Hawks). Although he rejected the latter opportunity, Ridd did travel to Helsinki where, although the Canadian team won all their matches in the qualification round, he was eliminated in Round One after the squad failed to win a single game. 1954 was also an eventful year, which had Ridd claim a Canadian national championship with the Winnipeg Paulins and end up four points shy of being the top scorer at the 1954 FIBA World Championships. He retired from the sport a year later and was eventually named to the Manitoba (1983) and Canadian (1980) Basketball Halls of Fame, as well as the Manitoba Sports Hall of Fame. For many years he remained active as an amateur basketball coach. Even while capturing the title of lead scorer in the Winnipeg Senior Men’s League on six occasions, Ridd was active academically, earning a Master’s Degree from United College and, after his career, a PhD from Drew University in New Jersey. Three years after his athletic retirement he was ordained by the United Church of Canada and served as a minister in both Canada and the United States until 1966, when he returned to Winnipeg to join the Religious Studies Department at United College, now known as the University of Winnipeg. Remaining there until 1995, he received the Robson Award for Excellence in Teaching in 1973 and was equally lauded for his achievements within the community, earning the Clarence Atchison Award for Excellence in Community Service in 1989. In addition to his peace and justice activism, he served on the Manitoba Environmental Council from 1980 through 1985 and chaired the Manitoba Energy Council from 1983 through 1988. The author of over 400 articles across numerous disciplines, his talents extended to economics, where he was an editor of a four-page quarterly on the topic called The Eyeopener, and music, where he was an avid flutist.

From the early beginning he did informal shots of everyday subjects. He enthusiastically photographed automobile races, fashionable ladies at the seashore and the park, and kite flying. In 1912 he succeeded in photographing a passing race car, which is among the earliest photo snapshots in the world. His photographs reveal his free spirit and love of life, rather than a concern for photographic technique and craft, and often captured a sense of movement. When his work was discovered in the 1960s it was first acclaimed for its departure from formal, posed portraits and for its ingenuous charm and beguiling spontaneity. His pictures were firstly published in the Museum of Modern Art in New York. Lartigue actually studied painting at the Academie Julian in Paris, but was only moderately successful as a painter and later gave it up in favor of photography. Although there are well-known photographs from the 1920s by Lartigue of the motifs (boxing, hurdling) of the submitted pictures, it is unlikely that he was allowed to submit these. For the “110 m hurdles” there is a note in the catalog that it was a sketch.",

A recently acquired Olympic Torch from the 1948 Games was also part of the arts exhibit, which is thought to have been used on the Belgium leg of its trip across Europe. The British Olympic Committee chose architect Ralph Lavers, a native of Australia and expert in classical architecture and archaeology, to design a functional torch representing British craftsmanship at its best. He accompanied several expeditions to Egypt, Crete and Mesopotamia and illustrated their reports. Lavers designed two versions: a light one made from polished aluminum for the relay stage runners and a heavier one in stainless perforated steel for the final runner. The design of the torch was used once again for the 1956 Melbourne Games. The height of the aluminum torch was 47 cm with a weight of 960 g. A total of 1,688 pieces were produced in 1948 for 1,416 runners. Both types were manufactured by EMI Factories Ltd. and High Duty Alloy Ltd.

95820,Lorenz Nieberl,Male,7 June 1919,,, Germany,GER,"West German bobsledder Lorenz Nieberl won two gold medals at the 1951 World Championships at Alpe d’Huez together with pilot Anderl Ostler in the two-man event and completed by Michael Pössinger and non-Olympian Xaver Leitl in the four-man event. In 1953 he won the gold medal in the two-man event at his home track of Garmisch-Partenkirchen together with pilot Theo Kitt, while in 1954 at Cortina d’Ampezzo he earned a bronze medal with Kitt and non-Olympians Theo Grün and Klaus Koppenberger in the four-man. Nieberl also won two gold medals at the 1952 Winter Games at Oslo with Ostler in the two-man event and completed by Fritz Kuhn and Franz Kemser in the four-man event. In order to have a shot at the title, the second German four-man sled wasn’t entered, and instead the two heaviest pushers – Kuhn and Kemser – joined Ostler and Nieberl in the remaining sled. This gave the Germans a decisive advantage, as they weighed in at 472 kg (including sled), and they comfortably slid to the gold. The international bobsleigh federation (FIBT) soon afterwards decided to limit the weight for four-man teams to 420 kg. Four years later Nieberl slid with Hans Rösch, placing ninth in the two-man event and sixth in the four-man event with his sled completed by Pössinger and Sylvester Wackerle. Nieberl’s wife, Evi Lanig, and his brother-in-law, Hans Peter Lanig, were alpine skiers. In 2006 the story about the 1952 German four-man bob was told in a cinema comedy called Schwere Jungs (Heavy Boys).",Husband of Evi Lanig Brother-in-law of Hanspeter Lanig Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the World Bob & Skeleton Championships (FIBT/IBSF) (2–0–2 1951 Alpe d'Huez gold: Two-man and Four-man (competed for West Germany); 1953 Garmisch-Partenkirchen bronze: Two-man (competed for West Germany); 1954 Cortina d'Ampezzo bronze: Four-man (competed for West Germany))

Nicknamed “The Pocket Hercules,” he first came to international acclaim at age 14 at the World Junior Championships in São Paulo. At the 1984 European Championships he became the second man (after Bulgaria’s Stefan Topurov) to lift three times his own bodyweight overhead. Süleymanoğlu was also the first man to snatch 2½ times his own bodyweight (27 April 1988). Prior to the 1988 Olympics, he had set 32 world records before he was 22-years-old. Süleymanoğlu was 1982 World Junior champion, and at the 1983 World Championships became the youngest ever world record holder with snatch and total records at age 15, winning a silver medal. At the 1988 Olympics, Süleymanoğlu was absolutely dominant, lifting a weight which would have won the weight class above his. He was born in Bulgaria and represented them until he defected to Turkey at the 1986 World Cup finals. Born Naim Suleimanov and of Bulgarian Turkish descent, he had made the decision a year before after he was quite upset when the Bulgarians changed his name to Naum Shalamanov in 1985, to remove vestiges of its Turkish origins. Once in Turkey, he changed the name again to a more Turkish one. In order to compete internationally for Turkey, the Bulgarian government was paid $1,000,000 by Turkey. Süleymanoğlu was World Champion at 60 kg. in 1985, 1986, 1989, and 1991 and European Champion in 1984, 1985, 1986 and 1988. He did not compete in 1987 because he had recently defected and was not allowed to until the Turkish authorities received permission from, and paid, the Bulgarians. He also did not compete in 1990, retiring briefly before making a successful comeback. In 1992 at Barcelona, he defended his Olympic championship despite his recent retirement, and won his third Olympic gold medal in 1996 at Atlanta. He also competed at Sydney in 2000 but failed to medal. He later entered politics in Turkey. Süleymanoğlu died very young after undergoing surgery for liver failure.","Brother of Muharrem Süleymanoğlu Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the Mediterranean Games (1–0–0 1991 Athina WLT gold: featherweight -60 kg) Listed in Olympians Who Set a World Record in Weightlifting (featherweight -64 kg (1993-1997) Snatch – 5 May 1994 - 7 August 1994 and 20 November 1994 - 19 November 1995: 145.5 kg (5 May 1994; Sokolov, CZE), 147.5 kg (20 November 1994; İstanbul, TUR), featherweight -64 kg (1993-1997) Clean & Jerk – 14 November 1993 - 20 November 1994, 20 November 1994 - 4 May 1995, and 22 July 1996: 177.5 kg (14 November 1993; Melbourne, Victoria, AUS), 180.0 kg (5 May 1994; Sokolov, CZE), 181.0 kg (20 November 1994; İstanbul, TUR), 182.5 kg (20 November 1994; İstanbul, TUR), 185.0 kg (22 July 1996; Atlanta, Georgia, USA), featherweight -64 kg (1993-1997) Total (biathlon) – 14 November 1993 - end: 322.5 kg (14 November 1993; Melbourne, Victoria, AUS), 325.0 kg (5 May 1994; Sokolov, CZE), 327.5 kg (20 November 1994; İstanbul, TUR), 330.0 kg (20 November 1994; İstanbul, TUR), 332.5 kg (22 July 1996; Atlanta, Georgia, USA), 335.0 kg (22 July 1996; Atlanta, Georgia, USA)) Listed in Olympic Order Recipients (2001 (Silver))"

119765,J. R. Celski,Male,17 July 1990,173.0,63, United States,USA,"J. R. Celski seemed to have a short, meteoric career at the highest levels of short-track speed skating, after starting out as an inline skater. He competed at the 2009 World Juniors and World Championships, winnings golds at the junior meet in the 500m, the 3,000m relay, and a silver in the 1,500 metres. At the 2009 World Championships he added a gold in the 3,000 metres, and 5,000m relay, bronzes in the 1,000 and 1,500, and a silver in the overall. Great things were expected of him at the 2010 Winter Olympics, but during the US Trials, he fell after a collision and his own skate blade slashed his left thigh, requiring over 60 stitches. It was not certain if he would be able to compete at the Vancouver Olympics. But he recovered quickly, despite damage to a skater’s all-important quadriceps muscle. In Vancouver, Celski won two bronze medals, in the 1,500 metres and the relay. After the Winter Olympics, he competed again at the World Championships, adding three more medals – silver in the relay, and two bronzes in the 1,000 and 3,000. And seemingly that was it for his skating career as he retired after two years at the top of the sport. Later in 2010, Celski established MAD Northwest, with MAD standing for Music, Art and Dance, to promote the arts in his native northwestern United States. The company is a self-funded start-up and he hopes to use it to get into film producing, beginning with a documentary on the Seattle area hip-hop music scene. However, Celski returned to the rink to try to make the 2014 US Olympic team and he succeeded, winning a silver medal in the relay at Sochi. He also competed at the 2014 World Championships, winning the 3,000 metre event (a non-Olympic event), and taking silvers in the 500 metres and overall. Celski again “went into hiding” for the next few years but then he re-surfaced the year before the PyeongChang Winter Olympics and made his third US Olympic team at the 2017 US short-track trials.","Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the World Short Track Speed Skating Championships (3–4–4 2009 Wien gold: 3000 m and 5000 m relay, silver: Allround, bronze: 1000 m and 1500 m; 2010 Sofia silver: 5000 m relay, bronze: 1000 m and 3000 m; 2014 Montréal gold: 3000 m, silver: 500 m and Allround) Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the World Short Track Speed Skating Team Championships (0–0–1 2009 Heerenveen bronze)"

Within two years of him joining the team, he was the team’s assistant captain and helped them win the Western Intermediate League Championship, which earned them the right to represent Canada at the 1950 World Ice Hockey Championships, where the team easily took the gold medal. It was this victory that would, two years later, catch the eye of the Canadian Amateur Hockey Association and send his team to the 1952 Winter Olympics, where Canada took the gold medal in the ice hockey tournament. In eight games played, Purvis scored two goals. After the Olympics, Purvis returned to Calgary to work at his team’s sponsoring dealership and retired in 2002 as the company’s owner and chief executive after over half a century of service. He was also the director of the Edmonton Eskimos Canadian football team for many years, including the five consecutive seasons that they were Grey Cup champions, and played amateur baseball for the Edmonton Cubs and the Edmonton Dodgers.

At national level they were Italian champions nine consecutive times from 1995-2002 and during that time they also won significant international honors. In 2000, Fusar Poli and Margaglio won a silver medal at both the European Championships in Wien and the World Championships in Nice to become the first Italian ice dancers to win a medal at these championships. On both occasions they finished behind the French couple Marina Anissina and Gwendal Peizerat, and this would be the start a long, and occasionally controversial, rivalry. The Italians won both the European title in Bratislava and World title in Vancouver in 2001, with the French couple in second place on both occasions. Fusar Poli and Margaglio won another silver medal at the 2002 European Championships in Lausanne, and at the Salt Lake City Olympic Games the Italian skaters finished third in a competition embroiled in a judging scandal. They announced their retirement shortly afterwards. After a few years away from the sport, however, during which time Barbara had a baby with her husband, Olympic speed skater Diego Cattani, Fusar Poli and Margaglio teamed up again at the end of 2005 with the sole purpose of competing in the 2006 Torino Games and hopefully winning gold on “home soil”. The Olympic final started in the best possible way, with the Italian duo leading after the compulsory dance, but they fell twice in the final stages of the original set pattern program, and their medal dream faded away. The long look of disappointment on Fusar Poli’s face as she refused to look at Margaglio at the end of the routine spoke volumes. They eventually finished a disappointing sixth, and in July that year announced their retirement from the sport for good. Fusar Poli had the following placements at major international championships - Dance: 1993 World Championships (22nd); 1994 World Championships (17th); 1994 European Championships (17th) (with Alberto Reani (a non-Olympian) [ITA]). 1996 World Championships (10th); 1997 World Championships (9th); 1998 World Championships (5th); 1999 World Championships (5th); 2000 World Championships (2nd); 1995 European Championships (10th); 1996 European Championships (8th); 1997 European Championships (7th); 1998 European Championships (5th); 1999 European Championships (4th); 2000 European Championships (2nd); 2001 European Championships (1st); 2002 European Championships (1st); 2002 European Championships (2nd); 2002 European Championships (2nd); 2002 European Championships (2nd) (with Maurizio Margaglio [ITA]).",Wife of Diego Cattani Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the European Figure Skating Championships (1–2–0 2000 Wien silver: ice dancing; 2001 Bratislava gold: ice dancing; 2002 Lausanne silver: ice dancing) Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the World Figure Skating Championships (1–1–0 2000 Nice silver: ice dancing; 2001 Vancouver gold: ice dancing) Listed in Olympians Who Received the Italian Olympic Association (CONI) Gold Medal ()

Originally from County Durham, where he enjoyed rowing, Backhouse moved to Herefordshire in 1886 and became involved in local life. Apart from joining the local archery club, he was a member of the North Herefordshire Hunt.

Radcliffe started out running distances from 3,000 to 10,000 metres but eventually became best known for her marathon exploits. She ran the 5K at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, finishing fifth, and the 10K in 2000 and 2004, placing fourth at Sydney. Through 2022 she remains the British record holder for women at 3,000, 5,000, and 10,000 metres. Radcliffe was a six-time World Champion, winning the marathon in 2005, the half-marathon in 2000, 2001, and 2003, and the International Cross-Country (short) in 2001-02. She also garnered four silver medals at World Championship events, in the 2001 10K, the short race at the International Cross-Country in 1997-98 and 2001, and the long race in 1999. Radcliffe was at her best in major city marathons, winning seven titles. She won London in 2002-03 and 2005, New York in 2004 and 2007-08, and Chicago in 2002.

In 2003 at London, Radcliffe took the marathon mark to another level, running 2-15:25, a mark which stunned long-time track statisticians as it was such an outlier. That would remain the women’s marathon world record for over 16 years until Brigid Kosgei ran 2-14:04 at the 2019 Chicago race.

103315,Laure Manaudou,Female,9 October 1986,180.0,69, France,FRA,"One of the prominent female swimmers of the first decade of the 21st century, Laure Manaudou excelled in the long distance freestyle events, as well as the backstroke. Her first major international event were the 2004 European Championships, during which she claimed three golds (400 freestyle, 100 backstroke, medley relay). At the Athens Olympics later that year, Manaudou became the first Frenchwoman to win an Olympic swimming title, claiming the 400 freestyle gold. She added a silver in the 800 free, and a bronze in the 100 back. In the next few years, she collected a large batch of medals, including three golds at the World Championships (as well as two silvers and a bronze), an additional six European titles and eight European short course titles. In 2007, she was proclaimed World Swimmer of the Year. Manaudou also beat world records in the long distance freestyle event, although she has since lost all her records. In 2007, Manaudou was featured prominently in the press, first leaving her coach, then breaking up with her Italian swimmer boyfriend Luca Marin, which was followed by nude pictures of Manaudou emerging on the Internet. The 2008 Olympics turned out to be a deception for Manaudou. While she reached two Olympic finals, she failed to medal in either of those, and this would be her last major competition until she officially announced her retirement in 2009.

12333,Harry Llewellyn,Male,18 July 1911,,, Great Britain,GBR,"Harry Llewellyn, educated at Oundle and Trinity College, Cambridge, was a well-known steeplechase jockey in pre-war days, his greatest success coming in 1936 when, while still an undergraduate, he finished second in the Grand National riding his father’s horse Ego. He rode Ego again at Aintree the following year and finished fourth. The war soon followed and Llewellyn saw action in Italy and Normandy and he was awarded the OBE for his work as Field Marshall Montgomery’s chief liaison officer. After the war, Lieutenant Colonel Harry Llewellyn was a leading figure in the business world of South Wales and he gave his time unsparingly to all equestrian causes. At various times he was a Stewart of the National Hunt Committee and Chairman of the British Show Jumping Association and in 1969 he was elected a Steward of the Jockey Club. In 1953 he was awarded a CBE and, after being knighted in 1977 for his services to Wales, he succeeded to the Baronetcy the following year on the death of his elder brothers. In show jumping circles Llewellyn’s name is inextricably linked with that of his horse, Foxhunter. The famous pairing represented Great Britain no less than 35 times with the performance which most captured the public imagination coming in the final round of the show jumping event in the 1952 Olympics. After a near-disastrous first round, Llewellyn was under extreme pressure, but he took Foxhunter through a faultless round and Great Britain won her only gold medals of the Helsinki Games. Unfortunately, certainly uninformed sections of the British press tended to view this success in a team event as an individual victory for Foxhunter and his rider and Wilfred White and Duggie Stewart, who both had less faults than Llewellyn throughout the competition, were not always given their due. Llewellyn’s youngest son Roddy had a much publicised relationship with HRH Princes Margaret, the sister of HM Queen Elizabeth II, who was 17 years older than Roddy. The relationship lasted eight years, during which time they spent a great deal of time together on the holiday isle of Mustique. Their relationship contributed to the eventual break-up of Margaret’s wedding to Lord Snowdon.","Listed in Olympians Who Participated in the Grand National Steeplechase as a Jockey, Trainer or Horse Owner (Rode as a jockey aboard Ego in 1936 and 1937, finishing 2nd and 4th respectively) Listed in Olympian Members of the Nobility (Sir)"

920578,August Babberger,Male,8 December 1885,,, Germany,GER,"Babberger was trained as a house painter and applied unsuccessfully for admission to the Art Academy in München. But he also studied in Karlsruhe and even received a scholarship to attend the International Art School at Firenze. Later, he worked primarily as a landscape painter in Switzerland. In 1920 he became a professor at the Art Academy in Karlsruhe and led this institution from 1923-30. His works were mainly influenced by Swiss artists of Art Nouveau and Symbolism, which later changed into an expressionist style with strong simplifications. As an Expressionist, in the Nazi era, he was considered a “degenerate” artist and lost his job. He went to Switzerland, where he died soon after in 1936. Babberger was married to the rear glass painter and poet Anna Maria Tobler (1882-1935). The identity of Babberger’s work entered in 1928 is unclear: in the German catalog it is called Wettlauf (Footrace), a design for a carpet, which is also shown there. In the international catalog, it is called Printemps (Spring) without reference to the type of work. Since other works have also apparently been exchanged in the meantime, it is questionable whether it is the same work. In 1935 he published a series of woodcuts under the title Großes Jahreszeiten Bilderbuch (Great seasons Picture Book). The coloured woodcuts with verses of his wife were already created in 1909. Possibly Spring is one of these woodcuts. The mosaic designs Ehrung der drei Turnväter (Honoring the Three Fathers of Gymnastics) and Ehrung des Siegers (Honoring the winner) were submitted in 1936, although he had left Germany already.",

During the 1990-1991 season, however, he only skated in two games with Montreal, spending most of his time instead with the American Hockey League’s Fredericton Canadiens, where he won the Dudley “Red” Garrett Memorial Award at the league’s top rookie. After playing exclusively with Fredericton during the 1991-1992 season he decided to try his luck with Team Canada at the 1992 Winter Olympics. At the tournament he suited up for eight games, scored one goal, and took home a silver medal as a member of the first Canadian national team to reach the Olympic podium since 1968. Upon his return he was traded to the NHL’s Calgary Flames but, once again, was limited in his league’s appearances, this time skating in only one game and spending the rest of the season with the International Hockey League’s Salt Lake Golden Eagles.

His career was disrupted by World War II, during which he spent three and a half years as a prisoner in a Japanese camp. Following his release, he moved from the Dutch East Indies to the Netherlands and continued his sport of choice, eventually making the national team. In 1950 he won a gold medal at the European Championships and, two years later, was selected to represent the Netherlands at the 1952 Helsinki Olympics. There, the squad finished fifth after defeating all of their opponents in the qualification round. His next stop was the 1954 European Championships, where the Dutch finished just off the podium in fourth. He also qualified to attend the 1956 Melbourne Olympics, but the Netherlands boycotted those Games following the Soviet invasion of Hungary. Gelder was employed as an actuary upon his arrival in the Netherlands, but was eventually able to follow his true passion of working in the medical field. Trained as a physiotherapist, he travelled to the Olympics with the team for every edition between 1964 and 1976.

16704,Jock Stewart,Male,15 December 1883,,, Great Britain,GBR,"Jock Stewart first attracted attention as a future champion in 1911, when he finished fourth in the NCU 50-mile Championship at Birmingham. The first three men home were crack riders Clarrie Kingsbury, Charles Denny and Henry Lee but, despite their presence, Stewart led at 10-, 20- and 30-miles, and was second at 40-miles. The runner-up in the 1913 Southern Counties 50-mile Championship at Herne Hill, Stewart’s cycling career was put on hold during World War I. However, after the hostilities, he won the 1919 Southern Counties 50-mile tandem-paced title, for the third time, and therefore made the “Cycling Trophy” his permanent property. That same year, Stewart was third in the NCU 1-mile Championship behind future fellow Olympians Harry Ryan and William Ormston. In 1920, Stewart and Ryan won the Madison event at Herne Hill, and the following year were beaten on the line trying to retain their title. A Metropolitan Police officer, Stewart was promoted to inspector in 1924, and stationed at Kensington High Street. He competed in many police sports events, and proved himself as an all-rounder and, as well as winning many cycling events, was a good track and field athlete and won events ranging from sprint, to middle-distance, and he was even a useful shot putter. He was described by Athletic News in 1924 as the “Genial and hefty Kentish Wheeler”. When Jack Holdsworth broke his own 24-hour tandem-paced record at Herne Hill in 1929, Stewart was one of his pacers.",

He then joined CSKA Moskva and he ended his career in 1957-58, playing with SKA Kalinin (now Tver). Shuvalov won five Soviet Championships (1951-53, and 1955-56) and was the best goal scorer at the Soviet Championships in 1950 (31 goals) and 1953 (44 goals, with Aleksey Guryshev). Internationally, Shuvalov, with his club mates from VVS Moskva and later with CSKA Moskva Vsevolod Bobrov and Yevgeny Babich, were considered one of the best lines in the mid-50s. The trio scored about 200 goals in 50 or so matches from 1954 to 1956. Besides his Olympic gold, Shuvalov was World Champion in 1954 and 1956 and was second in 1955. He also won European Championships in 1954-56. When still an active player in 1957, Shuvalov started to work as a head coach of SKA Kalinin. After retirement in 1958, he continued to coach SKA Kalinin until 1964. He was head coach of Kristall Elektrostal and in 1969-70 was an assistant coach of Spartak Moskva, winning Soviet Championships with them in 1970 and placing second in 1969.

In 1953 Smith was appointed assistant Secretary of the Navy for air by President Dwight Eisenhower, and in 1957 he became director of the International Cooperation Administration, which was the U.S. foreign aid program. In 1954, Smith publicly admitted that the Navy had wrongly suspended Abraham Chasanow as a security risk in July 1953 and issued Chasanow a public apology. His refusal to bow to pressure from Senator Joseph McCarthy’s anti-communist hysteria is considered to be the basis for the film Three Brave Men.

In 1959 Kelly moved to the United States where he considered a boxing career and began to train at Bobby Gleason’s Gym in New York, but instead started to run marathons, and ran the 1964 Yonkers Marathon, which was won of the two US Olympic Trials that year. In 1965 he won the Philadelphia Marathon in 2-37:23, although it snowed throughout the race. At the time of the 1968 Olympics, in which he raced as a walker, he competed for the Melrose Athletic Association outside of Boston.

The ensuing publicity resulted in the dismissal of charges of supplying arms to the IRA and their release from prison – Senator Ted Kennedy and the Archbishop of Texas aided in this effort.

From there he progressed to the snow covered Cairngorms before venturing onto other European peaks, and beyond, as he became one of the best British skiers of the 1970s, taking part in World Cup events and competing at the 1976 Innsbruck Olympics. Fitzsimmons won the slalom and combined to win the 1971 Kandahar Junior Championship when just 14-years-of-age. The following year he won the boy’s slalom title at the British Junior Alpine Skiing Championships as a member of the Scottish Ski Club. He won the first of four senior British titles in 1973 but could not defend his title the following year after missing the 1973/74 season following an accident in which he suffered a back injury in training. However, he returned and regained the title in 1975 and then won it for a third time in the Olympic year. Injury meant he could not defend his title in 1977 and in December 1978 he announced that after too many injuries he was retiring from competitive skiing. However, after sponsorship from some local businessmen he was persuaded to compete in the 1979 British Championships for a final time and he surprised many by winning his fourth title, becoming the first man to do so in the process. After his eventual retirement, Fitzsimmons became a skiing coach, worked as a cameraman for the iconic BBC television programme Ski Sunday, and had his own production company, “Fitzi Films”. It was during his time at Ski Sunday that he became both innovative and controversial. Innovative in as much as he raced down the slopes alongside competitors armed with a camera and sound recording equipment (in the days before the use of lightweight equipment). His technique enabled viewers at home to feel as though they were on the piste and this played a large part in making the programme as popular as it was. However, this innovation also led to controversies, none more so than in a 1992 World Cup slalom race at Val D’Iserre. Fitzsimmons followed Alberto Tomba down the course and after crossing the finishing line, the Italian burst into a tirade of expletives saying the cameraman distracted him as he endured his worst finish in a slalom event in six years. However, this was not the first time such an incident happened to Fitzimmons, as he had previously collided with skiers on a couple of occasions during filming of the British Championships.",

In the 1920s he studied pedagogy and in 1929 he graduated in interior design. In 1926 he was a co-founder and the first director of the ŁAD Artists’ Cooperative. From 1928 Kintopf also taught at the Academy of Fine Arts in Warszawa. In the 1930s he worked on the further development of looms. In World War II Kintopf took an active part in the Warszawa Uprising, surviving the war in a POW camp for officers in Germany. In 1946 Kintopf returned home and became Professor and Faculty Director at the Department of Interior Architecture at the Poznań Academy of Fine Arts, where he taught, among other things, material composition and interior design. Kintopf’s entry was listed in the 1936 catalog under arts and crafts, a category that did not exist in the competition. He submitted his Jacquard design “hors concours”, however, so he was not forced to follow the competition categories. Orleta Olimpijskie (Olympic Eagles) from 1934 is one of Kintopf’s most famous patterns and can be seen today in the Central Textile Museum. The Jacquard fabric uses multicolored threads, thus simulating a 3-dimensional image of eagles on the 2-dimensional material.",

In 1909, he took a six-month leave of absence from his job to study art in Paris. He began in the style of the French Impressionists, then worked with abstract grids inspired by Cubism, but returned to a more Impressionist style of painting, albeit with abstract elements. Friedman painted landscapes, figures, sports scenes, and later still lifes, primarily as paintings, but also as watercolors and engravings. He created a remarkable oeuvre as an American modernist in the early 20th century but was not appreciated until long after his death. Friedman probably submitted three lithographs “hors concours”. It is not certain whether these included the detected Race track (16 x 36 cm) and Polo (23 x 36 cm), both with the same sheet size of 29 x 41 cm. Jamaica Race Track, the title of the third lithograph, was a racetrack in New York that existed from 1903 until the 1950s. Polo Player was a painting, maybe equivalent to Polo (oil on canvas, 41 x 64 cm), dated 1920.",
6336,Magic Johnson,Male,14 August 1959,205.0,100, United States,USA,"In terms of professional basketball, Magic Johnson is often included on any Mount Rushmore of the greatest players of all-time. Earvin “Magic” Johnson starred in college at Michigan State University and in 1979 led the Spartans to the NCAA title, defeating Indiana State, led by Larry Bird, in the final game. The game remains the most highly watched NCAA title game ever, and over the next 15 years, Magic and Bird’s names would become synonymous as they, along with Michael Jordan, resurrected NBA basketball, restoring popularity in the professional game. Johnson was drafted in 1979 by the Los Angeles Lakers as the first overall pick, and he played in the NBA from 1979-91, but would later return for part of the 1996 season. During his time with the Lakers, he led them to five NBA titles (1980, 1982, 1985, 1987-88), being named finals MVP in 1980, 1982, and 1987. Most of those years, the Lakers battled the Boston Celtics, led by Bird, for supremacy. Johnson was a 6-9 (2.05) point guard, the largest ever to play the position, but was known for his passing skills. However, in the 1980 NBA Final, center Kareem Abdul-Jabbar was out with an ankle injury in the sixth game. Magic moved over to the center position, proving he could play anywhere, and led the Lakers to the victory, which gave them the title. Johnson won three NBA MVP awards (1987, 1989-90) and was a 12-time All-Star (1980, 1982-92). He was named All-NBA First Team for nine consecutive years (1983-91), and was second-team in 1982. He led the NBA in assists in 1983, 1984, 1986, and 1987, and in steals in 1981 and 1982. Johnson retired with career averages of 19.5 points/game, 7.2 rebounds/game, and 11.2 assists/game, the all-time NBA leader in assists. In November 1991 Johnson held a press conference to announce that he had been diagnosed as HIV-positive and would retire from the NBA. At the time, the disease was held to be almost uniformly fatal, and this announcement came only a few months before a similar one by tennis superstar Arthur Ashe. Fortunately for Johnson, but not Ashe, his disease was not far advanced, and better treatments allowed him to live almost a normal life. Johnson was chosen for the 1992 US Olympic Dream Team, which dominated the opposition to win the 1992 Olympic gold medal. There was some controversy in that, as at the time there was more concern about HIV viral transmission by contact on the sporting field, which proved to be unwarranted. In 1994 Johnson returned to the Lakers as a coach, although he coached them for only part of that season and 16 games, and with little success. In 1996 Johnson returned and played part of that season with the Lakers, though his talents had diminished, both because of age, and his time away from the game. However, he formed the Magic Johnson All-Stars, a touring team, and also played a few games in 1999 with M7 Borås in Sweden. After his retirement from basketball, Johnson became a businessman and entrepreneur, among the most successful African-American businessmen in the country. He also worked as a television analyst and a motivational speaker. In 2012 Johnson joined with a group of businessman to buy the Los Angeles Dodgers. He has had part ownership in the Dayton Dragons, a minor league baseball team; the Los Angeles Sparks, a WNBA team; and the Los Angeles FC, a Major League Soccer franchise. In February 2017 Johnson became President of Basketball Operations for the Lakers.","Listed in Olympians Who Won Olympic, NCAA and NBA Basketball Titles (Olympic Champion: 1992; NCAA Champion: 1979 Michigan State University; NBA Champion: 1980, 1982, 1985, 1987-88 Los Angeles Lakers) Listed in Olympians With a Net Worth > $100M ($600M (The Richest, 2019))"

In 2000 and 2004, the team placed fourth. Individually, fifth place in 2008 was her best result. In 2004, Klimke’s team-mate Bettina Overesch-Böker-Hoy was a tragic figure after mistakenly doing a warm-up before starting the jumping element of the competition. She went on to win the individual, and helped Germany win the team competition, but after repeated protests that she had crossed the start line twice, she received penalty points. Consequently, the team was re-classified fourth and Overesch-Böker-Hoy ninth individually. In addition, her horse tested positive, but the doping allegation was subsequently dropped because the association doctors were involved in the medication. At World Championships, Klimke won another two team gold medals in 2006 and 2014, and an individual bronze in 2018. At the Europeans she won team gold medals in 2011, 2013, and 2019, and individual gold medals in 2017, 2019-20. In 2013, she also added an individual silver.

However, following an injury sustained whilst playing for Reading shortly before the Games he had to withdraw and his place was taken by Leonard Dawe. Born at Thame, his first club was Thame United before joining Oxford City.

He also appeared in both Reading’s matches in the last-16 of the FA Cup which saw Manchester United win a replay 3-0 after a 1-1 draw at Reading., After the injury that ruled him out of the Olympics he turned professional with the Royals and in 1913 he toured Italy with them and scored in all five of their tour games, in just eight days, including a goal in the win over the Italian National side. He went on to become a Reading legend, scoring 77 goals - 60 of them in the Southern League. However, he had the honor of scoring Reading’s first ever goal in the Football League, away to Newport County in the 1-0 win on 28 August 1920. He only had one Football League season with Reading, but scored 18 goals in 44 League and Cup games before winding down his career with Boscombe and then Sittingbourne. Before he left Elm Park, the club organised a Benefit game for him and Joe was reported to have sold a ticket to the future King of England, Edward VII, to attend the match. Having been an Oxford hockey player and cricketer, he was appointed the cricket coach at Warwick School in 1921.

He was selected to the Bulgarian national team in 1950 after his military service with the Bulgarian Army. Mehmedov had a brief, but quite successful international career. He first competed internationally at the 1955 World Student Games, winning gold in Greco-Roman heavyweight. In 1956, he won bronzes in both Greco-Roman and freestyle at the World Cup and established himself as one of the medal contenders at both heavyweight styles at the 1956 Olympics. At Melbourne, Mehmedov won silver in freestyle, but a few days later had to withdraw from the Greco-Roman event after two bouts due to injury. In 1957, he won gold in freestyle and silver in Greco-Roman heavyweight at the World Student Games and later won bronze at the 1957 World Freestyle Wrestling Championships. Those World Championships were Mehmedov’s last international appearance as he finished his competitive career in 1959.

A fortnight later, Kleine also grabbed the World Allround title in front of a home audience. He closed out the season by setting four World Records in the course of one week. Apart from his medals, his 1976 season also earned Kleine the award for Dutch Male Athlete of the year and a job as a mailman. In a televised interview, Kleine mentioned that he was still jobless, despite his Olympic title, and was then offered the mailman job. Although Kleine never again made the podium in international allround events, he did win a third Olympic medal, winning silver behind the unbeatable Eric Heiden in the 1980 10,000 m.

42373,Gerald Merlin,Male,3 August 1884,,, Great Britain,GBR,"Although Greek-born and a resident of Athens, Gerald Merlin was of British parentage and elected to represent Great Britain at the Olympic Games. There were eleven separate individual shooting competitions at the 1906 Olympics and Gerald Merlin took part in ten of them. Apart from his medals in the clay pigeon events, his best performance was in the dueling pistol at 25 metres where he finished fourth shooting at dummies dressed in frock coats. In 1906 the clay pigeon, single shot, competition consisted of 30 clays from four traps at a distance of 16 metres and as Merlin and Ioannis Peridis of Greece each hit 24 clays, a shoot-off was necessary. Peridis was the first to make a mistake when he missed the fourth clay and the gold medal went to Gerald Merlin. One of Merlin’s infrequent visits to England coincided with the 1908 Olympic Games when he took the opportunity to defend his Olympic title but he was not successful and finished in 19th place. Gerald Merlin and Sidney Merlin are invariably referred to as brothers but this is not correct. A search of the British Consular Birth Register reveals that Gerald was the son of Charles E. P. Merlin and his wife Irene (nee Stournare) whereas Sidney was the son of the British Vice-Consul for Athens, Charles L. W. Merlin and his wife Isabella (née Green). However, they were certainly related and were, in all probability, cousins.",Nephew of Sidney Merlin

Homesickness drove him back to Ireland before he joined the pro ranks and he resumed his schooling and eventually gained a qualification in sports science at Dublin City University.

There, he trained as an assistant tax accountant and joined the top German club Kölner EC. Within a few years he became one of the club’s most valuable wingers, winning the German championship in 1977 and 1979. He stayed with the club during a period of financial difficulty and led them to another two German titles in 1984 and 1986. Schiller then moved to rivals Mannheimer ERC. Even though the club regularly reached the play-offs, they failed to win the title, mostly losing out to his former club, Kölner. From 1991, Schiller played two more seasons with EHC Dynamo Berlin (later Eisbären Berlin) before he had to give up professional hockey due to damaged spinal disks. He won 94 caps for the German national team playing in, amongst others, the 1988 Olympics, scoring two goals, four World Championships (1981-1983, and 1986) and the 1984 Canada Cup.

48134,Éva Székely,Female,3 April 1927,,, Hungary,HUN,"Swimmer Éva Székely demonstrated her swimming talent early by setting a Hungarian national record at the age of 14, but her Jewish ancestry meant that the authorities prevented her from competing during much of World War II. In 1944, when members of Hungary’s Arrow Cross party came to round up Jews in her community, her father told the young Hungarian Nazi who came to take her that she was a Hungarian swim champion and that he would later be happy that he saved her life. In the 1950s Székely saw that man again when she won a gold medal at an international meet on Margaret Island in the Danube and was given her medal by the same man, then a major of the Communist Political Police (AVO). After the war Székely was a dominant swimmer in Hungary, winning 43 national titles (32 individual and 11 team) between 1946 and 1954. On the international stage, she competed in three Olympic Games, from 1948 through 1956, winning the 200 metre breaststroke in 1952 and placing second in 1956. She also won a silver medal in that event at the 1947 European Championships and set numerous Olympic, World, and European records in individual and relay events. Székely married Dezső Gyarmati, a five-time Olympic medal-winning water polo player and their daughter, Andrea Gyarmati, ended up earning numerous swimming laurels herself, competing in the 1968 and 1972 Olympics, winning silver (100 back) and bronze (100 fly) medals in München. Éva Székely retired in 1957 and that year she and Dezső Gyarmati briefly defected to the United States, although they returned to Hungary in 1958. They later divorced but until then were also the in-laws of Mihály Hesz, who competed in canoeing at the 1964 and 1968 Olympics, winning one gold and one silver medal. Hesz and Andrea also later split up. After her retirement Éva Székely had a career as a pharmacist. She also coached swimming in Hungary, with Andrea as one of her pupils. In 1976 Éva was made a member of the International Swimming Hall of Fame, and is also a member of the International Jewish Sports Hall of Fame.","Mother-in-law of Mihály Hesz Mother of Andrea Gyarmati Wife (divorced) of Dezső Gyarmati Listed in Olympians Who Set a European Record in Long Course Swimming (100 m breaststroke – 9 May 1951 - 1 January 1953: 1:16.9 (9 May 1951; Moskva, URS); 400 m medley – 10 April 1953 - 28 March 1955 and 13 July 1955 - 2 December 1956: 5:50.4 (10 April 1953; Budapest, HUN), 5:40.8 (13 July 1955; Budapest, HUN); 4×100 m freestyle relay – 27 April 1952 - 1 August 1952: 4:27.2 (27 April 1952; Moskva, URS); 3×100 m medley relay – 14 October 1950 - 2 December 1950: 3:41.2 (14 October 1950; Budapest, HUN); 4×100 m medley relay – 24 July 1953 - 3 August 1954 and 3 September 1955 - 19 November 1956: 5:10.8 (24 July 1953; Budapest, HUN), 5:09.2 (10 August 1953; Bucharest, ROU), 4:57.8 (3 September 1955; Budapest, HUN)) Listed in Olympians Who Set a World Record in Long Course Swimming (100 m breaststroke – 9 May 1951 - 20 July 1958: 1:16.9 (9 May 1951; Moskva, URS); 400 m medley – 10 April 1953 - 2 December 1956: 5:50.4 (10 April 1953; Budapest, HUN), 5:40.8 (13 July 1955; Budapest, HUN); 4×100 m freestyle relay – 27 April 1952 - 1 August 1952: 4:27.2 (27 April 1952; Moskva, URS); 3×100 m medley relay – 14 October 1950 - 2 December 1950: 3:41.2 (14 October 1950; Budapest, HUN); 4×100 m medley relay – 24 July 1953 - 3 August 1954 and 3 September 1955 - 19 November 1956: 5:10.8 (24 July 1953; Budapest, HUN), 5:09.2 (10 August 1953; Bucharest, ROU), 4:57.8 (3 September 1955; Budapest, HUN)) Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the European Aquatics Championships (0–1–0 1947 Monte Carlo SWM silver: 200 m breaststroke)"

68952,Chris Chataway,Male,31 January 1931,175.0,69, Great Britain,GBR,"Chris Chataway was a man of many and varied talents. He first came to prominence as an athlete where his brief five year career in international competition took in 2 Olympic Games, a European Championships and a British Empire Games. Chataway’s major championship debut came at the Helsinki Olympics where he led the field with 150 m to go in the 5000 m final. He eventually finished 5th after stumbling and falling whilst being overtaken by Emil Zatopek. 1954 was Chataway’s greatest year as an athlete. Firstly he was one of the pacemakers when Roger Bannister recorded the first sub-four minute mile, then he excelled in his own right by winning the three miles at the British Empire Games in Vancouver and winning the silver medal over 5000 m at the European Championships ahead of Zatopek but behind future Olympic champion Volodymyr Kuts. At the end of the season he gained revenge over Kuts in a dramatic 5000 at London’s White City stadium where both men finished inside the existing world record. It was probably for that performance that Chataway was voted Britain’s Sport Personality of the Year for 1954 ahead of Bannister. He went to the 1956 Olympics as one of the medal favourites but, plagued by illness, did not make an impression in the final. This was the final race of his international career although he continued to race occasionally for his club. By the time of his retirement from serious athletics Chataway had already became a familiar face on British television screens. In 1955 he became the first man to read the news on ITV, Britain’s newly formed first commercial TV station, and then switched to the BBC for a three year stint as a current affairs reporter. He then changed careers to become a member of parliament for the Conservative party but lost his seat in the 1966 general election. After three years out of parliament he was re-elected in 1969 and went on to serve as Minister for Industrial Development in the Edward Heath government from 1972 to 1974. Chataway retired from politics before the 2nd of 1974’s 2 general elections and began a career in business. He served as Managing Director of Orion Bank as well as being active several charities before being appointed as head of the Civil Aviation Authority in 1991. In addition he was President of the Commonwealth Games Council for England for 19 years between 1990 and 2009. Chataway was awarded a knighthood by Queen Elizabeth II in 1995.

Frank Benson studied in Boston and later in Paris. He later worked as a teacher and artistic director at the school of the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston. He created many paintings and etchings of wild birds and also produced numerous portrait paintings. He was a very popular painter, which gave him great financial freedom and placed him among the “Ten American Painters.” Benson is considered the founder of the school of American Sporting Art and his prints are highly desired. After his death the auction house Sotheby’s obtained $4.1 million for one of his paintings. In 1932, Benson submitted 11 works, including three oil paintings and watercolors and eight graphic works. All paintings were entered “hors concours” and were on loan from the Addison Gallery in Andover, Massachusetts. The 91.8 x 112.1 cm oil painting On the Restigouche was painted in 1927. The Restigouche is a river in the Canadian province of New Brunswick. River in Flood was a watercolor with graphite from 1928 sized 53.7 x 67.3 cm, Salmon Fisherman was another one from the same year (53.2 cm x 45.2 cm). Two of the graphic works were also shown “hors concours”, Winter Wild Fowling and Old Tom. The latter was the only graphite drawing, made in 1926 (36.2 x 20.5 cm). The etching Winter Wild Fowling (1927) showed two duck hunters placing lures to prepare for the hunt. The sheet size was 38 x 32 cm, and the print 30 x 25 cm.

Originally she competed in the Europe class of dinghies and was ninth at the 1992 Olympic Games. She was in medal contention for the entire Olympic regatta in 1996 but a couple of poor races proved the difference between a bronze medal and fourth place and she missed out by just two points. Between Atlanta and Sydney she became a regular contender at the World Championships placing 4th, 2nd, 3rd and 2nd in sequence and emerged as one of the favourites for the Sydney Olympics. Robertson went to the top of the standings after race 2 of the 11 staged in Sydney Harbour and was never headed from then on until the end of the competition and became the first British Olympic champion in 80 years. After being named the ISAF’s “Sailor of the Year” for 2000 she then switched classes to join Sarah Ayton and Sarah Webb in the Yngling class of boat to form a trio that was given the affectionate nickname of “Three Blondes in a Boat.” The three women combined to seal victory at the Athens Olympics without having to race on the final day of the competition. Robertson missed most of 2005 and 2006 due to the birth of twins but returned with the intention of competing at the Beijing Olympics. Since Ayton and Webb had already found a replacement for her on their boat she decided to form her own crew. Although successful in their own right they were not able to oust her former teammates from a place on the Olympic team. Robertson was present in Beijing as a member of the BBC commentary and has since moved into television presentation with CNN International as host of their sailing programme “Mainsail.”",

920041,Heinrich Krause,Male,9 June 1885,,, Austria,AUT,"Austrian painter Heinrich Krause studied at the Wien (Vienna) Academy of Art and spent a year in Italy with a Rome Prize travel grant. From 1914-37 he was a member of the Vienna Secession, then a member in the Vienna Künstlerhaus (House of Artists Museum), and is considered one of the most important Austrian painters between the two world wars. Krause’s early landscapes give an occasional hint of Austrian Impressionism. The most lasting are his French landscape paintings, which he created during a stay there. His later floral pieces show a spiritual, material form of light. In some floral pieces and still lifes, and less often in figural compositions, his relationship to New Objectivity became visible. Krause’s Boxer, oil on canvas in the format 47 x 38.5 cm, was also shown at the exhibition of the Vienna Secession in the year of the Olympic Games in Berlin. The oil paintings submitted in 1936 and 1948 are probably identical.",

After a world record in the ranking round, they easily won their quarter-final and semi-final matches. The gold medal round against China was a lot closer, though, and only decided with the final arrow (241-240). Lee has since gone on to win several more international titles.

In World War II most Hungarian Jews were deported to concentration camps, but Petschauer’s status as an elite sportsman exempted him initially. In 1943 he was deported to the Davidovka concentration camp in Ukraine. The story, as it has been usually told, was that during a prisoner line-up Petschauer was called out by the commanding officer of the camp, Lt. Col. Kálmán Cseh von Szent-Katolna, who had competed in equestrian for Hungary at the 1928 Olympics. It was mid-winter and bitter cold, but the guards forced Petschauer to undress and climb a tree, and while up there, they sprayed him with freezing water. It is also said that he was beaten with a wire whip until his spine was exposed and he died shortly thereafter. This story was told in the 1999 film “Sunshine,” starring Ralph Fiennes. However, this has now been questioned as Hungarian military archives state that Petschauer died during an outbreak of typhus that spread through a Soviet POW camp.","Listed in Olympians Who Died in Nazi Concentration Camps (labor camp Zavidovo) Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the World Fencing Championships (2–2–3 1925 Oostende bronze: sabre; 1926 Budapest silver: sabre; 1929 Napoli bronze: sabre; 1930 Liège gold: sabre team, silver: sabre; 1931 Wien gold: sabre team, bronze: sabre) Listed in Olympians Who Were Killed or Missing in Action or Died as a Result of War (†20 January 1943.

Unsurprisingly for a cavalryman he was an expert horseman but his skills on horseback were legendary even amongst his own peers. A polo player of the top rank, he won approximately 300 races as a jockey in both flat and steeplechase racing and was a member of the British Olympic team at both show jumping and three day eventing at the Stockholm Games of 1912. His Olympic performances were not memorable, a fact he blamed on the haphazard preparation of the British team. In October 1915 Kenna by then a Brigadier General with the 21st Lancers regiment took part in the disastrous Gallipoli landings on the coast of Turkey. Whilst on one of his regular inspections of the front lines at Chocolate Hill, he was struck by a sniper’s bullet and fatally wounded.",Listed in Olympians Who Were Killed or Missing in Action or Died as a Result of War (†30 August 1915.

Most of his records and titles were in those events, but he is best known for marks he set in the javelin throw that were later removed from the record books. In the mid-1950s Errauzquin began experimenting with throwing the javelin like the discus, using a spin technique and soaping his hand to help release the implement, which became known as the Basque technique. Doing this he set two outstanding marks, close to the world record, throwing 74.32 on 7 October 1956 in Barcelona and then 83.40 on 13 October in Bilbao. Reports of other records by other athletes appeared but because the spin/Basque technique was considered to be very dangerous to officials and spectators it was quickly banned by the IAAF (World Athletics). This should not diminish Errauzquin’s status as a top Spanish weight thrower. He won 28 Spanish titles – 9 in the shot put, 9 in the discus, 8 in the hammer throw, and 2 in the javelin. He also set two Spanish records in the shot put in 1936 and three discus throw records, one in 1943 and two in 1948. Personal Best: SP – 13.90 (1936); DT – 44.56 (1959).",

Lenglen played at the US Championships only in 1921, when she lost in round two to Molla Mallory, withdrawing in the first game of the second set, after losing the first set, because of a chronic cough. Lenglen avenged that defeat in the 1922 Wimbledon final, winning 6-2, 6-0, and then at a tournament in Nice later in 1922, Lenglen double bageled her. She was the world #1 ranked player from 1921-26. Lenglen also won the French doubles in 1920-23 and 1925-26, and the mixed in 1914, 1920-23 and 1925-26.

Browne, the 1912-14 US Champion, but it was no contest, Lenglen winning the series, 38-0.

He was world-ranked number one from 1991 to 1995, dominating the event. The first man to ever run the steeplechase under eight minutes, Kiptanui is also the 1996 Olympic silver medalist from Atlanta. Kiptanui missed the 1992 Olympic Games in Barcelona when the World champion surprisingly failed to qualify at the Kenyan Olympic Trials. Just a week after the Games he missed, Kiptanui broke Moroccan Said Aouita’s record over 3000m, and three days after that, he broke the 3000m steeplechase world record previously held by countryman Peter Koech going 8:02.08. In 1995, Kiptanui broke the 5000m world record in Rome (12:55.30), and shortly after winning his 1995 World title, he broke the 3000m steeplechase record again in Zurich (7:59.08). In 1997, Kiptanui ran his personal best 3000m steeplechase time in Cologne (7:56.16), ranking him seventh on the all-time list. Kiptanui, a World Junior 1500m champion, was gifted a horse for his achievements at the 1995 World Championships, but he sold the horse for $10,000 USD to buy a dairy farm that produced 500 litres of milk daily from 20 lactating cows (from his herd of 100) and employed 12 farmhands and an animal health expert. Post athletics career, Kiptanui also coached 2004 Olympic gold medalist steeplechaser Kenya’s Ezekiel Kemboi. Involved in sports administration, Kiptanui was chairman of the Marakwet District branch of Athletics Kenya. In honour of his athletic achievements, a school was built and opened in 2012.

Together with his brother Jacques and Charles Richet, he worked on the “gyroplane”, a predecessor of the helicopter. In 1907, their craft performed the world’s first vertical flight, hovering about 50 cm. above the ground. From 1909 on, Bréguet concentrated on conventional aircraft. In 1917, he developed the Bréguet 14, possibly France’s most famous military aircraft of all time. The biplane, which was used for reconnaissance and bombing, was used by the French, Belgian and American air forces during World War I, and remained popular post-war. Bréguet was also involved in commercial aviation, establishing an air mail carrier that would go on to merge with Air France. In the 1930s, he returned to his first love, vertical flight. His “Gyroplane Laboratoire” (1935) was considered the first practical helicopter. After his death, the Bréguet factory was acquired by Dassault. His name still lives on, however, in a mathematical formula to determine the range of an airplane. Apart from flying, Bréguet loved to sail, and he entered his own yacht “Namoussa” in the 1924 Olympic 8-metre class. With his crew of four, he gained a bronze in the five-boat field.",

At the end of the Mexico City Olympics, Odložil married the famed Czechoslovak gymnast Věra Čáslavská, although they would divorce in 1987. Odložil retired from competition in 1969 and became a military officer. However, political constraints forced him to leave the military and he went into coaching, first at Sparta Praha and then from 1979-81 in Mexico. Odložil was reinstated to the Army in 1989 and stayed there until his death. In 1992-93, he commanded the Czechoslovak regiment of the UN peacekeepers in Iraq. On 7 August 1993 Odložil had an argument with his 19-year-old son, Martin, who hit him in the head, which caused a brain injury and Josef Odložil went into a coma. He never recovered and died shortly over a month later. His son was sentenced to four years in prison but the sentence was commuted by Czech President Václav Havel.

921534,Hunt Diederich,Male,3 May 1884,,, United States,USA,"Hunt Diederich was (from his mother’s side) the grandson of the American painter William Morris Hunt and the grandnephew of the American architect Richard Morris Hunt. His father was a Prussian cavalry officer who bred horses in Hungary. After his father’s early death, Hunt was educated partly in Switzerland around Lake Geneva and went to his maternal grandfather in Boston in 1900. There he began to study art but gave it up temporarily to work as a cowboy in the western United States. In 1906 Diederich resumed his studies in Philadelphia, later also studying in Roma and Paris. He traveled to Spain and North Africa, especially Morocco, but returned to New York when World War I broke out. In the 1920s he also lived and worked in Germany. From 1941 he settled again in New York. He was mostly known for bronzes of animals or people with animals for his silhouette cuts. His brother-in-law was the important German paper cutting and silhouette artist Ernst Moritz Engert. Hunt Diederich’s reputation suffered, however, due to his pro-German attitude and Antisemitism and he was forgotten for a long time. After World War II, he exhibited in Europe as well as in America. In 1928 and 1932 he submitted works both in painting and sculpturing to the Olympic Art Exhibition. The identity of the work Polo Players, which was submitted in 1928, is uncertain. It could well be one of the iron weather vanes with polo motifs, which he is said to have been produced around 1926. His bronze sculpture Polo was not created until 1932 and was awarded “Honorable Mention” in the same year. It is 41 x 69 x 25 cm in size. The Race horse is probably one of his bronze figures of jockeys on horses produced in the late 1920s. One of his most famous works is Diana and Hound from 1925. The bronze version from 1930 is about 68 cm high. In the 1932 art catalog, Diederich’s paper silhouettes are listed separately under “Silhouettes” and not attributed to a specific section. Some of these works can be identified, while some series – such as the 1925 one on bullfighting – comprised more than the number of works exhibited. Four of his boxers, which he laid on silver paper, are known, in formats of 18 x 28 cm and 22 x 30 cm, respectively. Apparently only three were exhibited, however, as indicated by the numbering in the catalog. The Polo player adorned the cover of the catalog, and almost certainly the Mounted Archer and the Fighting Bucks were among the works that were exhibited. There is more than one version, however, of the Matador, the Picador and the Bull Fight. As far as the formats are known, they can be assigned to two groups: smaller ones of an average 17 x 22 cm and larger ones of 23 x 32 cm. Unlike the boxers, these silhouettes were all underlaid with white paper.",

Seelenbinder was unemployed for long periods and had casual work after leaving school. He began studying the writings of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels and was expelled from his club in 1928 because he favored Communism. He represented Germany in the first Spartakiad in Moscow in 1928 after which he joined the KPD Communist Party of Germany. After the nationwide banning of the workers’ sports clubs in 1933, he was arrested, for a second time, but was again released. He then refused the Hitler salute at the German Championships in the same year and was banned for 18 months. He wanted to repeat his stance at the 1936 Berlin Olympics, but because if injury, he failed to get onto the podium. In 1942, he was arrested as a member of a Communist resistance force, dragged through seven prisons and concentration camps, tortured and eventually sentenced to death. In October 1944 he was executed by beheading in Brandenburg Prison. Seelenbinder received numerous awards posthumously. In 1950 the Werner-Seelenbinder-Hall was officially inaugurated in East Berlin.

He was also a director of Hull FC Rugby League Club. Padgett was acknowledged as one of the finest rifle shots produced by Yorkshire, and for 22 years he served as a volunteer and rifleman with the 1st Volunteer Battalion of the East Yorkshire Regiment (Hull Rifles). Padgett had a fine record in the annual Bisley Meeting. He won the Grand Aggregate Silver Cross in 1906, and added the Gold Cross the following year when he was also runner-up in the Secretary of State for War prize. That year, however, 1907, he was involved in one of the most bizarre turn of events seen at Bisley. In the Meeting’s leading event, the King’s Prize, Padgett finished one point ahead of the Lieutenant W. C. Addison, and Private T. P. Hope. Having been congratulated on his victory by Lord Roberts, the band was getting ready to start up and accompany Padgett on his victory parade as he was chaired around the grounds. An objection, however, was put in. It had been discovered earlier that his sixth cartridge in the final round was defective and did not reach the target. He was allowed to fire one more cartridge that gave him three points and enough to win the title by two points. But the objection claimed he should not have been allowed a replacement cartridge as per the rules and those three points were deducted, relegating Padgett to fifth place. The title eventually went to Addison after a shoot-off, as he became the first Australian winner of the King’s Prize, and on his Bisley début.",

69364,Steve Ovett,Male,9 October 1955,183.0,70, Great Britain,GBR,"After winning the 1973 European Junior 800 metres title when he was only 17-years-old, Steve Ovett was in the forefront of world middle-distance running for more than a decade. He took part in three Olympic Games (1976-84) and although he won the Olympic 800 metres title in 1980, he was probably at his best over the 1,500 metres/mile distance. In 1980, after setting two world records at 1,500 metres and bettering Seb Coe’s world mile record, Ovett was a firm favorite for the Olympic 1,500 metres title but his run of 45 successive victories over the distance, which stretched back to May 1977, was broken when he finished third in Moscow. In 1981, he bettered the world mile record for a second time and 1983 saw him achieve his third world record at 1,500 metres. Between 1977 and 1983 he set 12 UK records at distances ranging from 800 to 2,000 metres. Apart from his record breaking feats, Steve Ovett was a brilliant competitor and built an outstanding record in major championships. At 800 metres he won the European Junior title in 1973, the European Cup in 1975 and the Olympic gold medal in 1980. Over 1,500 metres Ovett won at the European Cup in 1977, the World Cup in 1977 and 1981, and the European Championship in 1978. Proof of his amazing versatility at the very highest level came when he won the 5,000 metres at the 1986 Commonwealth Games. He was always able to produce a devastating finishing burst off a fast pace, and this talent made him one of the finest middle-distance runners in the history of the sport. When Ovett and Seb Coe were at their peak, no other country could match Britain’s strength in the middle-distance events, and both athletes rendered a great service to British sport. Apart from his defeat in the 1980 Olympic 1,500 metre final, Ovett suffered a major disappointment at the 1984 Olympics when, because of bronchial problems, he was not at his best and after finishing last in the 800 metres final he was forced to drop out of the 1,500 metres final. After failing to qualify for the 1990 Commonwealth Games team, he gradually dropped out of the big-time athletics and spent more time developing his career as a television commentator. He has worked for Canadian network CBC as part of their commentary team since 1992. Ovett relocated to Australia during the 90’s and his son Freddie has represented his adopted country over 800 m at junior level.

Burns was the son of Wallace Burns, one of many British Hondurans who came to England in 1942 to work under a scheme organized by the Ministry of Labour. Kevin was breaking swimming records from an early age, and in 1968 his British junior 100 metres freestyle record of 1:00.3 stood for five years. He went on to win various junior age group national titles, and in 1970 became the first black swimmer to appear for Great Britain when he competed for GBR’s juniors against Netherlands’s juniors. A few months later Burns became the first British black swimmer to win a senior England cap, in the triangular match with Scotland and Wales. He was just 14-years-old at the time. Having made his senior Great Britain début in the match against the Netherlands and United States at Crystal Palace in 1972, Burns joined the British squad in training for the München Olympics but, unfortunately, he never made the trip. It was a different story four years later when Burns was selected for the 1976 Montréal Olympics. He finished fourth in his 100 free heat, won by the eventual gold medallist Jim Montgomery. Burns had to then go into a two-man swim off for the 16th and final semi-final place, but was beaten by the Soviet swimmer Andrey Bogdanov. Burns was classified in 17th place. In the 4x100 medley relay, Burns swam in the heat that saw Great Britain reach the final in a new British record time, but Burns was replaced by Brian Brinkley for the final, in which Britain finished fourth. Burns set a British 100 free record of 53.11 at the Olympics, and then followed that with his only individual ASA title a month later. Burns’ only major international medal came at the 1978 Commonwealth Games in Edmonton, when he was part of the English team that won the 4x100 freestyle relay bronze medal.",Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the British Empire/Commonwealth Games (0–0–1 1978 Edmonton SWI bronze: 4×100 m freestyle (competed for England))

She attended a school swimming gala to cheer on her sister Jean but, when she had to pull out, Jean persuaded Margaret to take her place, and that was the start of a tremendous career for the young Scot. A pupil at the Kilmarnock Academy, McDowall was runner-up in the ASA Girls’ Backstroke Championship at Derby in 1949 when aged 13. She went on to win both the ASA junior and senior backstroke titles in four consecutive years, 1950-53. McDowall also won many junior and senior Scottish titles, including nine successive backstroke titles between 1950-58. At Paisley in 1951, aged 15, she set a British record 1:08.3 for the 100 yards backstroke, and lowered it to 1:07.9 at Motherwell in 1953. When she appeared against England and Wales at Aberdeen on 13 August 1950 for the Bologna Trophy, McDowall became the youngest Scottish international swimmer at the age of 14. Scotland only won the Bologna Trophy twice (1950 and 1951) during its 32 history and McDowall was on both winning teams. McDowall was selected for the 1952 Helsinki Olympics and reached the final of the 100 metres backstroke, finishing seventh. Two years later at the Vancouver British Empire and Commonwealth Games, she failed to medal in the individual backstroke but won gold with fellow Scots Elenor Gordon and Margaret Girvan in the 3x110 yards medley relay in a Games record 3:51.0 A lack of good training facilities, because of the local council’s refusal to help out, resulted in McDowall missing out on both the 1956 Melbourne Olympics and 1958 Commonwealth Games in Cardiff and, at the of 22 in 1958, she retired from competitive swimming. McDowall obtained the necessary swimming teaching and coaching qualifications and established courses to help babies and people with special needs.

His first partner was Mariya Petrova and together they became World Junior Champions in 1994 and 1995. Sikharulidze and Petrova last competed together at the 1996 European Championships, but then parted ways due to coaching disagreements. In early 1996, Yelena Berezhnaya, with whom Sikharulidze had became romantically involved a year before, had a serious training accident, that left her partially paralyzed, so Sikharulidze moved to Riga, Latvia, where Berezhnaya was hospitalized. Berezhnaya made an unusually quick recovery, and they started training together in November 1996 and soon rose to be one of the top pairs in the World. They won Olympic gold in 2002 and silver in 1998. They were also World Champions in 1998 and 1999, taking silver in 2001. They also won European titles in 1998 and 2001 and a European Championships bronze in 1997. The pair initially won the 2000 European Championships, but were later stripped of their medals after Berezhnaya tested positive for pseudoephedrine. She had taken cold medication approved by a doctor but had failed to inform the ISU as required and as a result they were disqualified from sports for three months from the date of the test. The pair also missed the World Championships that year as a result of the disqualification. After 2002 Olympics, Berezhnaya and Sikharulidze retired from competition and from 2002-06 toured together with Stars on Ice. In 2007, Sikharulidze entered politics, although he later made occasional appearances at some Russian ice TV shows like Ice Age. A member of the United Russia political party, Sikharulidze was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Saint Petersburg in 2007. On 2 December 2007, he was also elected to the Russian State Duma (parliament), and became chairman of the Russian State Duma Committee for Physical Culture and Sport. In 2010, Sikharulidze ran for the presidency of the Russian Figure Skating Federation, but withdrew after the constitution was altered, stating that the changes left the president as nothing more than a figurehead. In 2011, Sikharulidze married Yana Lebedeva, the daughter of Russian billionaire Leonid Lebedev.",Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the European Figure Skating Championships (2–0–1 1997 Paris bronze: pairs; 1998 Milano gold: pairs; 2001 Bratislava gold: pairs) Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the World Figure Skating Championships (2–1–0 1998 Minneapolis gold: pairs; 1999 Helsinki gold: pairs; 2001 Vancouver silver: pairs)

36061,Lesley Thompson-Willie,Female,20 September 1959,160.0,50, Canada,CAN,"With five medals across eight appearances at the Summer Olympics, Canadian Lesley Thompson-Willie has, as of 2016, attended more editions of the Games than any other rower. This feat is made even more impressive by the fact that she did not seriously take up rowing until her mid-20s; although she competed at the 1981 World Championships, and finished fourth in the eights, her initial vocation was that of a gymnast. It was not until she suffered an injury while competing for the University of Western Ontario that she switched to rowing as a full-time athletic career, serving as a coxswain due to her size and gymnastic background. She was fourth again at the 1983 World Championships, this time in the coxed fours, but captured her first major international medal at the 1984 Summer Olympics, silver, by finishing behind the Romanians in the same event. She won bronze in coxed fours at the next two editions of the World Championships, but slipped to sixth in the event in 1987, where she also placed seventh in the eights. After taking gold in the coxed fours at the 1986 Commonwealth Games, her final major race in that event came at the 1988 Summer Olympics, where the Canadian boat finished seventh. From that point on, she was exclusively an eights rower at major tournaments. Thompson-Willie had her best years in the early 1990s, when she reached the top of the podium at the 1991 World Championships and the 1992 Summer Olympics. The crew did not fare as well at the 1994 or 1995 World Championships, placing seventh and sixth respectively, but she did win a gold medal at the 1994 Commonwealth Regatta. From 1996 through 2000, however, Thompson-Willie never failed to reach the podium at the Olympics or World Championships. She captured silver at the 1996 Games and 1997 World Championships and bronze at the 2000 Games and the 1998 and 1999 World Championships. Thompson-Willie retired after the 2000 Olympics and turned to coaching. After five years, however, she decided to return rowing and rejoined the Canadian team in time to compete at the 2006 World Championships, where she finished fifth in the eights. She was sixth at the 2007 edition, fourth at the 2008 Summer Olympics, and then sixth again at the 2009 World Championships. She returned to the podium the following year and, as of 2013, has yet to leave it: she earned silver at the 2010 and 2011 World Championships as well as the 2012 Summer Olympics. Although still competing as of 2016, she has a career outside of athletics as a librarian and teacher at the London (Ontario) South Collegiate Institute and has been a member of the Canadian Olympic Hall of Fame since 1994.",Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the British Empire/Commonwealth Games (1–0–0 1986 Edinburgh ROW gold: coxed fours)

His father, Henri Pène du Bois (1858-1906), was a noted critic, and his son grew up in a highly cultured atmosphere, in a literary circle. Guy was born into a well-to-do, intellectual New York family. He followed the traditional educational path for a young painter, studying first in New York under William Merritt Chase and Robert Henri in 1899-1905 before traveling to Europe for further training. His earliest paintings were street scenes drawn in free brushstrokes and dark colors. One of his fellow students was painter Edward Hopper, with whom he had a lifelong friendship (1882-1967). In 1906, because of the death of his father, Pène du Bois returned to the United States and worked as a newspaper music and art critic, as well as an illustrator for a number of prestigious publications. The subjects of Pène du Bois’ paintings were often members of society whom he gently satirized. After 1920, the majority of his work focused on middle- and upper-class people in fashionable restaurants and nightclubs, often portrayed in a satirical manner. The rounded, simplified figures of his subjects have been compared to mannequins or caricatures and convey Pène du Bois’ critical attitude. In 1940, he published his autobiography. His son William (1916-1993) became a well-known writer. His 1932 entry, Approaching Storm, Racetrack, was painted by Pène du Bois in 1929 in oil on canvas (73,7 x 92,4 cm).",

He returned to England in 1962, but after some excellent performances as a junior high hurdler he went back to America and enrolled at Boston University in the autumn of 1964. During the next few seasons, Hemery represented Boston with distinction at the major US collegiate meetings and regularly crossed the Atlantic to complete for Great Britain in international matches. In 1966, he set a British record for the high hurdles of 13.9 seconds, won the Commonwealth title in Jamaica and had his first major win the 440 yards hurdles at the IC4A Championships in New York. After missing the 1967 outdoor season, Hemery won the 1968 NCAA title and twice reduced the British 400 metres hurdles record during the course of his Olympic build-up. At the Mexico Olympics in October, he made a further reduction to the British record in the semi-finals of the 400 metres hurdles and then came his historic run in the final, when he ran 48.1 seconds to set a world record which was to last four years and a British record which remained unbeaten until 1990. Appropriately, Hemery received his Olympic gold medal from David, Lord Burghley, who had won the event for Great Britain 40 years earlier. At the end of the 1968 season, Hemery was awarded the MBE and went up to St. Catherine’s College, Oxford, where he showed a remarkable talent as a decathlete, and by the end of 1969 he was ranked seventh on the UK all-time list. In 1969 he improved his own British 110 metres hurdles record to 13.6 seconds while the highlights of 1970 were the successful defense of his Commonwealth title and win the World Student Games. After a rest from competition in 1971, Hemery returned to the track in 1972 and in the Olympic final in Munich he ran 48.5 seconds to fish third place. He also won a silver medal in the 4×400 metre relay, when Britain equaled the European record. Hemery finished his amateur career on a winning note in the match against France in October 1972, and although he later had a few races as a professional he will always be remembered for his astonishing performance at Mexico City in October, 1968. After retirement, Hemery managed the Sobell Centre in London for two years but in 1975 he returned to America and spent seven years coaching at Boston University. He settled in England again in 1982 to run coaching courses and work with an educational trust. Hemery served a term as president of UK Athletics and in 2008 became vice-chairman of the British Olympic Association.

In 1957 Gömöry obtained a degree in chemistry from Eötvös Loránd University. Until his retirement, he worked as an assistant professor at the Department of General and Inorganic Chemistry, Eötvös Loránd University, and then became an entrepreneur. One of his most important research areas was the production and use of humic acid, which is important in agriculture and soil management. Sailors also saw the benefits of his chemical science, as he helped with special paints, experimenting with various synthetic resins even before these materials were generally available. In addition to his work, Gömöry worked for the Hungarian Sailing Association, chairing the training committee and was a member of the board. In the first half of the 1990s, he was a member of the General Assembly of the Hungarian Olympic Committee, representing his sport, and was also a part of the period of democratic elections in 1989.",Brother-in-law of Benedek Litkey

In 1956 he began another great series of victories with the first of his seven successive National 50km titles. The big disappointment of the 1956 season for Thompson, though, was his failure to finish in the Olympic 50 km. after collapsing when approaching the stadium. No athlete prepared more assiduously than the diminutive Don Thompson for the 1960 Olympics. With the aid of heaters and steam kettles he exercised in a sealed bathroom at his home in conditions which he felt stimulated the heat and humidity he could expect in Rome. This unique training method paid off as he won the gold medal with a new Olympic record of 4-25:30. Among those he defeated were all the post-war Olympic 50 km. walking champions: John Ljunggren (Sweden, 1948), Giuseppe “Pino” Dordoni (Italy, 1952) and Norman Read (New Zealand, 1956). Thompson took part in his third Olympics in 1964 and finished 10th. His best performance in three European Championships was his third place in 1962, but it was fitting that he chose the 1968 London-to-Brighton for his final race. He had a magnificent record in the classic road race, having won the event nine times and set a course record in 1957.

In the beginning, he copied Old Masters and then painted portraits, still lifes, church interiors, and landscapes inspired by Impressionism. Later he turned to the New Objectivity. He was a successful painter but was also highly controversial because of his Fascist leanings. During World War II he was a member of the Dutch Nazi Party NSB. In 1948 Gerdes was sentenced posthumously for collaboration with the Germans. He participated in the Art Competitions at the 1924, 1928 and 1936 Olympic Games. In 1928, he was also a member of the Art Committee of the Organizing Committee, after having already been a member of the Netherlands’ art commission for the representation at the Olympic Games in Paris in 1924.

Marcus represented Canada at the 1986 Commonwealth Games, but was defeated by Rod Douglas of England, the upcoming gold medalist, in the second round. He was the Canadian middleweight champion in 1987, one of five such titles that he earned as an amateur, but was passed over for that year’s Pan American Games on a technicality. He was selected for the 1988 Summer Olympics, however, and, after receiving a bye in round one, he defeated Emmanuel Legaspi of the Philippines, Darko Dukić of Yugoslavia, Sven Ottke of West Germany, and Syed Hussain Shah of Pakistan to reach the finals, where he lost to Henry Maske of East Germany and settled for silver. Marcus then turned professional and earned the NABF Light Heavyweight Title in 1992, successfully defending it three times. In a bid for the IBF World Light Heavyweight Title in 1995, he was dealt his first professional loss in 15 bouts by Maske, and then made unsuccessful attempts at the WBC Continental Americas Cruiserweight, WBO NABO Cruiserweight, and IBO Intercontinental Heavyweight Titles.

72647,Kokichi Tsuburaya,Male,13 May 1940,163.0,54, Japan,JPN,"One of seven children born to a disciplinarian father, Kokichi Tsuburaya was born with a left leg that was shorter than the right and suffered from tuberculous arthritis in his legs as a young child. Despite the pain associated with the sport, he followed his elder brother as a runner and began to make a name for himself in high school competitions. After he graduated from high school, Tsuburaya joined the Army and began to represent them in the long-distance relay races that are ingrained in Japanese tradition. After initially being left out of the Army physical training school programme aimed at the 1964 Summer Olympics due to a back injury, he was brought into the scheme in 1962 and began to build a reputation as a 5,000 and 10,000 m runner on the track. Seven months before the Tokyo Games he expanded his horizons by running his first marathon and just three weeks after his début earned a place on the Olympic team by finishing runner-up in the Japanese marathon trials. Tsuburaya’s Olympic experience began with an above expectation sixth place in the 10,000 metres in the race forever associated with the remarkable last lap victory sprint of Billy Mills. He was seen very much as the third-string Japanese runner in the marathon due to his youth and inexperience, so it was a surprise to see him as the only home nation athlete in medal contention at the halfway stage. Tsuburaya lost company with the leading pack early in the race but slowly picked off his opponents as they tired and when Jim Hogan of Ireland dropped with 7 km to go, he was elevated to second place albeit a distant second to Abebe Bikila. He entered the stadium still in the same position but with the fast finishing Briton Basil Heatley quickly making inroads into his lead. The Japanese runner’s energy was spent by this stage and with less than half a lap of the track to go, Heatley sprinted past him. Despite the disappointment of seeing the silver medal slip from his grasp, he was still feted as the only Japanese track and field medal winner at those Games. The next Olympic cycle was cruel to him. Firstly, his athletic career was severely affected by a series of serious injuries in the shape of a herniated disc exacerbated by overtraining, lumbago and finally an Achilles tendon injury that required surgery in 1967. On a more personal level, Tsuburaya was engaged to be married before his Olympic appearance but, as was the custom at the time, he had to apply to his commanding officer for the wedding to take place. His immediate superiors supported the marriage, but they were overruled by a higher-ranking officer who forbade it to take place until after the 1968 Summer Olympics. The delay put pressure on his fiancé’s family and eventually the engagement was called off and she went on to marry another man. This also lost him the services of his long-time coach who was punished for his protests against the decision by being removed from his duties with the athlete and being demoted in rank. Tsuburaya learned of his ex-fiancée’s marriage when he went home to his family for the New Year Holidays at the start of 1968 then returned to his training at high altitude in Mexico. On the morning of 8 January 1968, he took a razor blade and slit his carotid artery. His lifeless body was found later the same day with his bronze medal still cradled in his hand. Tsuburaya left a suicide note, more of a suicide poem, in which he thanked his family for their kindness, wishing his nephews and nieces to grow up to be fine men and women, and ended with the haunting lines: “My dear Father and my dear Mother, your Kokichi is too tired to run anymore. Please forgive him. He is sorry to have worried you all the time. My dear Father and Mother, Kokichi would have liked to have lived by your side.” In addition, he sent out individual apologies to his old school principal, to a teacher who had been influential in his life, and to the chairman of the Japanese Olympic Organizing Committee: “I’m sorry that I was unable to keep my promise. I pray for your success at the Mexico Games.” Kokichi Tsuburaya’s suicide is described as the biggest source of pain in Japanese sports history. After the tragedy the Japan Olympic Committee started providing support and mental health care for athletes.

He was introduced to sculling by his colleagues at work and initially joined the Cavendish Rowing Club. In 1903 he won the West End ARA sculling championship and repeated this success in 1904 and 1905, after which he joined the more prestigious Kensington Rowing Club. Over the next five years, Kinnear won numerous sculling events along the Thames and in 1910 he won the Diamonds and the Wingfield and, with both these victories being repeated in 1911, became firmly established as one of the world’s leading scullers. For 1912, Kinnear had as his target a hat trick of victories in the Diamonds and a gold medal at the Stockholm Olympics. He was surprisingly beaten tint he first heat of the Diamonds, various reasons being give for his defeat, the most plausible being that his favorite boat was already on it is way to Stockholm and that he had sculled at Henley in an unfamiliar craft. At the Olympics he won his heat, semi-final and the final without being extended, so retaining the Olympic sculling title for Great Britain. After a short break, he was back on the Thames and in August 1912 won the Wingfield Sculls for the third successive year. Although no more major championships came his way, Wally Kinnear continued rowing until the outbreak of war. He served with the Royal Navy Air Service for the duration and after the war took a keen interest in coaching. In later life he moved to Desford, Leicestershire, where he became a security officer.

He made his first international appearance at the 1968 Winter Olympics, having only discovered skating when 30-years-old. He competed internationally until 1977 and in those 10 years was a hugely popular figure, especially in the Netherlands. Occasionally the referee would have to ask him to stop skating laps of honor after his last race at an international meet, in order to be able to continue the competition. His best international performance was at the 10,000m in 1976 in Innsbruck where we finished eighth. His last prize was that of 1984 Swiss National Champion, at the age of 55! Initially ridiculed for his poor skating and his un-athletic style, he turned out to be a valuable contributor to the progress of speedskating and sports, as the designer and first user of the one-piece skin suit. He also contributed to the skate development. The last 13 years of his life Krienbuhl’s health was very poor, the result of a cycling accident in 1989 and a cerebral infarct during the following operation.

Jenner went to tiny Graceland College in Lamoni, Iowa, on a football scholarship, but shortly took up the decathlon and only one year later qualified for the 1972 Olympic team. After placing 10th in the 1972 Olympic decathlon, Jenner won the 1974 AAU title and in 1975 he was PanAm champion and set a world record (8,524) in the triangular meet with the USSR and Poland. In 1976, Jenner won his second AAU title and crowned a brilliant career by taking the Olympic gold medal with a new world record of 8,618 points. The charismatic Jenner became a television and movie personality as soon as his competitive days were over. After splitting with his first wife, he married Linda Thompson, who was Elvis Presley’s girlfriend when that legend passed away in 1978. After that marriage ended in divorce, Jenner married Kris Kardashian, ex-wife of Robert Kardashian, one of O. J. Simpson’s lawyers, and star of a reality television series in the United States. With that reality series, Jenner was thrust back into the public spotlight as “Keeping Up With the Kardashians” became very popular, although he and Kris Kardashian would later divorce. However, it was easily noted that his appearance was changing, in part due to multiple plastic surgeries. Rumors persisted for several years about his gender preference, and in 2015, Jenner bravely announced that he identified as a woman rather than a man. In an interview on ABC Television in April 2015, he stated that the interview was the last time he would be known publicly as Bruce.

During World War II, Franco was a prisoner-of-war and returned to Italy in 1945. The son of a farmer, he returned to work on the land but his dream was to be a successful cyclist. In 1947 he enjoyed 10 wins, among them the Coppa Agostoni (at that time for amateurs) by out-sprinting Zampini and Zanettini. He was selected for the World Championships at Reims that year, when the road race was won by his team-mate Alfio Ferrario. Fanto also competed in the 1948 Worlds, finishing ninth in the individual race and fourth with Ferrario and Predoni in the team event. At the London Olympics that year, Fanti finished 19th overall despite suffering a puncture. After the Olympics, Fanti won the Swiss Giro del Lemano and the following year turned professional with the Frejus team and, with Ferdi Kubler, contested the Giro d’Italia.

In the individual road race he took the silver medal, losing out in the sprint finish to the Soviet Viktor Kapitonov. Trapé turned professional in 1961 with the Ghigo team and almost immediately enjoyed success by winning the Giro di Campania. Nobody would have imagined, however, that victory would be his only one as a professional. During the 1961 Giro d’Italia he fractured his femur (thigh bone), but the following year enjoyed his finest moment when finishing second in the Giro di Lombardia behind Jo De Roo. Trapé competed in the Giro d’Italia three times but never managed to finish the race. His third place on stage 15 in 1964 was his best performance. After four disappointing and injury-prone years, Trapé found himself without a contract and it was a sad ending for a cyclist with so much potential.

In 1952 he finished second to Harrison Dillard at both the AAU and the Final Trials and in Helsinki, Dillard beat him again, after Davis hit the ninth hurdle hard. Davis went to the Melbourne Games in 1956 as the firm favorite – he had had the best of his main rival, Lee Calhoun, all year. But Calhoun upset Davis in the Olympic final by a few inches. Davis won the NCAA high hurdles in 1951, 1952, and 1953 and the low hurdles in 1953. At the AAU he won the highs in 1953 and 1954. Additionally he placed second in the 220y flat at the NCAA in 1952 and was Pan-Am high hurdles champion in 1955. Many years later, in an oral history interview with the Amateur Athletic Foundation of Los Angeles, Davis called the Olympic outcome a “real good life experience. I realized that I could not call every shot. There are some things which were out of my control.” Davis served in the Navy from 1954-57, and then went on to a career as a real estate developer and was inducted into the National Track & Field Hall of Fame in 2004.

However, fate intervened and she returned home without a medal of any colour. Curwen broke the world record twice within a year leading up to the Olympics. She set a new mark of 1:24.6 at Westminster Road Baths, Liverpool on 28 September 1911, and at Birkenhead on 10 June the following year, she reduced it to 1:20.6.

Shortly before the Olympic final, Curwen was rushed to hospital with an appendicitis, and had to undergo emergency surgery and therefore miss the final. Unfortunately for Curwen, her hospitalisation also deprived her a chance of being part of the Great Britain gold-medal-winning 4x100 free relay squad.

In 1964 in Innsbruck he took part in the luge singles, placed 25th among 38 entrants, and served as Great Britain’s flagbearer in the Opening Ceremony. Schellenberg became wealthy off of a variety of business ventures and purchased the Scottish island of Eigg in 1975 with the intent of conserving both its natural environment and its human history. Over the next two decades, however, the locals accused him of mistreating them and neglecting his responsibilities, with the anger culminating in a January 1994 arson attack against Schellenberg, who sold the island the following year. He also attempted his hand in politics in the 1960s, contesting the Richmond (Yorks) parliamentary constituency as a member of the Liberal Party in 1964 and 1966 and coming in third both times.",

He joined the Royal Vancouver Yacht Club in 1919 and founded the Vancouver Tugboat Company in 1924, firmly establishing himself in the city’s martime culture. He soon became involved in yacht racing and joined several British Columbia and Washington sailing clubs, but his most important race came in 1932 as a member of the RVYC, when he was selected to represent Canada in the 8 metre class at that year’s Summer Olympics, alongside Ernest Cribb, Peter Gordon, George Gyles, Ronald Maitland, and Hubert Wallace. Despite losing all four races, the Canadians brought home a silver medal from the Games because the only other nation to enter the 8 metre tournament was the United States. Jones served as Commodore of the RVYC in 1939 and again from 1944 through 1947. He was made an honorary life member in 1953.

920696,Erich zu Putlitz,Male,1 February 1892,,, Germany,GER,"German architect Herr zu Putlitz was a descendant of an old Brandenburg family of nobility. Initially trained as a stonemason, he was employed to restore the dome of Magdeburg, but from 1908-09 studied in Magdeburg at the Arts and Crafts School. Shortly before World War I zu Putlitz presented his first architectural design for the Schauspielhaus Theatre in Düsseldorf. In World War I he served as a naval aviator. Between the two World Wars he first worked in Sofia, and then mainly in Hamburg and Rostock. He was a member of the Nazi Party and helped with designs of buildings for the state and the Nazis. His architectural style was neo-classicism, and later monumentalism, which was later termed Nazi architecture. Internationally, he was known for drafts of the Palace of the League of Nations in Geneva and a never realized monument for Columbus in Santo Domingo. Zu Putlitz died shortly before the end of World War II. The submitted overall project for Rostock was to be comparable to the Berlin “Reichssportfeld” and the Nuremberg Nazi Party Rally Grounds. The work for the parade ground in Rostock commenced in 1936. The so-called “consecration” took place in 1939. Subsequently, a hall for congresses, sporting events, festivals and exhibitions for up to 20,000 spectators was to be erected on the highest point of the site. Below the lateral halls, whose base level would be 2.40 meters higher than the central hall, lobbies were planned. The south side of the central hall was reserved for orchestra and stage facilities. The war, however, prevented the realization of the plans. Today, the Baltic Stadium is located here.","Listed in Olympian Members of the Nobility (Freiherr (Baron), Edler Herr)"

Coached by his father, he rose to prominence in 1979, when he won his only Soviet title. Volkov won a silver medal at the 1980 Olympics, but missed a possible medal, perhaps gold, at the 1984 Olympics due to the Soviet boycott. Instead of the 1984 Olympics, Volkov competed at the Friendship Games, and won gold ahead of a young Bubka with a result of 5.80, which was 5 cm better than the gold medal jump made by Pierre Quinon in the Olympic final. In addition to his Olympic silver, Volkov won golds at the 1981 and 1983 Universiade, the 1981 World Cup and the 1979 European Cup, adding silvers at the 1983 World Championships, 1980 Europeans and the 1979 and 1982 European Indoor Championships. Volkov finished his sports career in 1986 and from 1986-91 worked as an athletics coach in his hometown of Irkutsk. After the fall of the Soviet Union Volkov became a businessman. From 2001-04, he was the general director of the Transsiberian Freight Company, from 2006-08 he was the deputy general director of the Siberian Metallurgical Company, and from 2008-09 he was the deputy managing director of the construction company Monolitstroy-Irkutsk.

He was also a double Blue at football, playing in any forward position. He made his England amateur international début against Ireland in 1919 and the following year was honoured with the captaincy of his country against Belgium. Later that year he was in the Great Britain XI that lost to Norway at the Olympic Games in Antwerp. A member of the famous Corinthians at the time, he first played for them in 1913 and toured Brazil with them. He also had spells at Brentford and Aston Villa. His only two Football League appearances were for Villa against Bradford Park Avenue and Preston North End in October 1919. After the Olympics, Sloley joined Ealing FC and remained with them until hanging up his boots at the end of the 1926-27 season, but he remained with the club as Chairman. He was also a schoolteacher, football referee and a radio broadcaster. During the First World War Sloley served with the Army Service Corps and while in Egypt learned to fly with the Royal Flying Corps. But, despite being a man of many talents, he was probably better known as the man who had a dream to create the Argonauts Football Club in 1928. He wanted to create a team made up of the best amateurs of the day and get them into the Football League, like Queen’s Park in Scotland. He even had the vision of playing home matches at Wembley Stadium – even though he had no players at the time. He failed at the first attempt to join the League and the creation of the team was put on hold. But, as he had a lease on Wembley, his beloved Ealing played eight matches at the famous stadium in the 1928-29 season but won just two of them, including the first ever amateur game played at Wembley, when they beat Hastings and St Leonards 1-0. Two more failed attempts to get the Argonauts into the League resulted in the end of Sloley’s dream. He died in 1946 at the University College Hospital, London, where, in the 1930s he was secretary of their nursing school",

14500,Felice Gimondi,Male,29 September 1942,181.0,78, Italy,ITA,"The long line of successful Italian cyclists seemed to end with the retirement of Fausto Coppi. The fanatical Italian cycling fans had little to cheer between the mid-1950s and mid-1960s, until the arrival of Felice Gimondi. Born in a small village near Bergamo in Northern Italy, Gimondi started his amateur cycling career in 1963, and that first year finished seventh in the Italian Road Race Champiosnhip. Very few people had heard of Gimondi when he was selected for the Italian team to take part in the 1964 Tour de l’Avenir, but they soon had, because the the 21-year-old won the race. At the end of that year, he turned professional with the Salvarani team, which he remained loyal to until the pulled out of the sport in 1972. In his first year as a professional, Gimondi won seven races, including the Tour de France. He came into “The Tour” as a late replacement for a Salvarani team mate, and soon dispelled any ideas that he was just another Italian rider with a fast sprint, as he proved himself a capable climber, sprinter and time-triallist as he won three stages on the way to victory. Gimondi’s success continued in 1966 when he won three Classics, the Tour of Lombardy, Paris-Roubaix and Paris-Brussels. No Italian had ever won more than three Classics in one year so here was Gimondi up with the greats in only his second season as a professional. The following year saw him win the first of three Giros (Tour of Italy), the second being in 1969 when controversy surrounded Eddy Merckx’s withdrawal following an alleged doping offence. In between these two Giro successes, Gimondi won the Vuelta a España (Tour of Spain) at his one and only attempt. Victory in the Vuelta meant the Italian was only the second man after the great Jacques Anquetil to win all three Grand Tours. Gimondi won the hearts of the British racing fans in 1970 after finishing third behind Jean-Pierre Monseré (Belgium) and Leif Mortensen (Denmark) in the World Road Championships at Mallory Park, Leicestershire. Having finished second to Merckx at the 1971 Worlds, Gimoldi gained revenge by outsprinting the Belgian in 1973. Now part of the Bianchi team, it was unfortunate for the Italian that he was continually racing in the shadow of Merckx, and having finished second to Merckx at the World Championship, Tour de France, two Giro d’Italia’s, Tour of Flanders Tour of Lombardy and the Milano-San Remo, Gimondi wondered if he would ever get the chance to put the record straight. The 1973 World Championship went a long way to doing that. Other major races won by Gimondi included the Grand Prix de Nations (1967 and 1968) and the Italian Road Race Championship (1968 and 1972). After a 15-year professional career, Gimondi retired from road racing at the end of the 1978 season, having proved himself to be the next great Italian cyclist after Coppi. After retiring from racing, Gimondi was with Gewiss in the late 1980s and was president of the Mercatone Uno team. He also worked for cycle manufacturer Bianchi, and was a member of the UCI’s ProTour Council in the late 2000s. Gimondi died while swimming on holiday in Sicily and, at the time of his death in 2019, was one of just seven men to have won all three Grand Tours alongside Anquetil, Merckx, Bernard Hinault, Alberto Contador, Vincenzo Nibali and Chris Froome.",Listed in Olympians Who Received the Italian Olympic Association (CONI) Gold Medal ()

A specialist in the 500 m, she broke the world record time on several occasions over the course of her career, sometimes breaking her own record, and was the first woman to complete the event in under 38 seconds, which she achieved in 1997. She was a champion in the event at the 1998 Games and claimed bronze in the 1000 m race as well, the same year that she also began to reach the podium regularly at World Championships and World Sprint Championships. In 1998 alone she took gold in the 500 m and the Sprint, along with silver in the 1000 m. Through 2002, she won an additional three gold, one silver and four bronze medals at these competitions. For over a month in 2001, she held the best 14 times ever skated at the 500 m, a prelude to her second Olympic gold in the event in 2002, where she was flagbearer for Canada at the Opening Ceremonies. At the time of her retirement in 2003, she held the World and Olympic records in the sport (the latter of which she still holds as of 2009). Le May Doan was named Canadian Female Athlete of the Year on three occasions (1998, 2001 and 2002) and won the Lou Marsh Trophy, given annually to Canada’s top athlete, in 2002. After her retirement, she took up motivational speaking (in both English and French), commentating on speed skating events for CBC and CTV and playing golf, the latter of which seems to be showing nearly as much promise as her previous athletic career. She is a spokesperson for numerous charitable organizations, including the Saskatoon Foundation Catriona Le May Doan Endowment for Children and Youth, the Spina Bifida and Hydrocephalus Association of Canada, Right to Play, and Ontario’s Lakefield Oval Project, and is a member of the organizing committee for the 2010 Winter Olympics.
