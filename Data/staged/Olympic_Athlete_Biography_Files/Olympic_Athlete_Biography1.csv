Due to his popularity, after his athletics career, Szmidt, who was trained as a mechanic, was expected to enter politics with the Polish Communist Party, but he refused to do so, which led the Communist government to revoke all his privileges and his public appearances were banned. This led him to defect to West Germany in 1975 during the Polish football team’s match against West Germany during a 1976 UEFA Euro qualifying match, when Szmidt managed to be included among the small fan base allowed to accompany the national team. In West Germany Szmidt settled in Lüdenscheid, where he worked as a physical therapist.

They performed strength, acrobatic and gymnastic shows around the area, but Evans went on to specialise in weightlifting. He bought his first set of weights from Ludgate Circus in London and, when they were delivered by train to Letterston railway station, Evans carried them on his bicycle to his home, about five miles away. Evans trained on the family smallholding and in 1947 he took part in his first big competition, the British Championships at Shrewsbury, and he won. He went on to become British Olympic Weightlifting champion four times. Evans competed at the 1952 Helsinki Olympics and finished 18th in the lightweight division. That same year he moved to Haverfordwest and became caretaker of a local school, where he ran weight-training classes. He then started a gym in the town centre and started a weightlifting section at a local boxing club where he produced several good lifters who went on to compete in national championships. In the 1970s Evans started the Tower Hill Gym, Haverfordwest, where one of his one of his protégées was Mary Hancock, who went on to become the British champion.

Kazantsev ran world bests in the steeple in 1951 and 1952, by clocking 8:49.8 in Moskva and 8:48.6 in Kyiv and went to the 1952 Olympic Games as the favorite for the 3,000 steeplechase gold medal. At the Olympics, Kazantsev won his heat comfortably and led by 20 metres with 700 metres remaining in the final, but American Horace Ashenfelter and British John Disley were closing hard. Kazantsev tripped on his last water jump, spraining his ankle, and was overtaken by Ashenfelter on the last curve, limping over the finish line in a disappointing second place. Ashenfelter was an FBI agent, and the American media delighted in headlines about an FBI agent who had chased down a Soviet runner, But it was probably unknown to the Americans at that time, and what would have spiced up the story considerably, was that Kazantsev was also an intelligence agent, having been recruited to the KGB after demobilization and who would later retire from the agency with the rank of lieutenant colonel. Kazantsev won nine Soviet titles – steeplechase in 1950-53; 5K in 1948, 1950 and 1951; 10K in 1951; and cross-country in 1946.

Initially overshadowed by the achievements of his brother Willi Frommelt, Paul eventually became the most consistently successful of the siblings and soon emulated Willi by winning a bronze medal at the 1978 World Championships in Garmisch-Partenkirchen. Unlike his brother he was a slalom specialist and it was in this discipline that he won all five of his World Cup victories. Wins in 1979 and 1981 were followed by a barren period before a late career flourish saw three further wins between 1986 and 1988. Prior to the Calgary Winter Games Frommelt’s Olympic exploits had been little short of disastrous and he had failed to record a finish in any of his first three Olympic appearances. This changed in 1988 when Frommelt, by now a veteran of 30, put together two consistent slalom runs to earn himself a bronze medal thereby matching his brother’s achievement in 1976. He retired from the circuit in 1990 – the same year he won the last of his seven “Sportsman of the Year” awards in Liechtenstein.

At the Olympics Smith lost in the semi-finals and then lost the bronze medal match to Denmark’s Svend Vad. His amateur record, always an estimate, is given as 52 wins and 4 losses. Smith turned professional in November 1948 and had an “odd” career as a pro. He won his first nine bouts but then was defeated frequently. However, in June 1955 he was given a shot at the World Lightweight title, and defeated Jimmy Carter to become the champion. He defeated Carter again in the re-match, but lost the title in August 1956 to Joe Brown, and Brown also won a re-match for the title in February 1957. Strangely, between his re-match with Carter, and losing the title to Brown, Smith fought three non-title bouts, and lost them all. He retired in April 1958, after losing his final 11 fights, finishing with a career pro record of 31 wins, 24 losses, and 6 draws, rather marginal for a world champion.

71137,István Encsi,Male,1 February 1943,194.0,108, Hungary,HUN,"When István Encsi was 17 years old he wanted to become a weightlifter. He could not implement his plan because Ózd Kohász, the local sport club, did not have a weightlifting department at the time. As an alternative he then chose the hammer throw, as it also requires strength. Two years later, he became the Hungarian youth champion in this discipline. Based on his results, he was then ranked seventh in the world among the youth hammer throwers. In 1964, he already won the title of adult team champion in the colors of Budapesti Honvéd. The two-year military service and the constant changes of affiliations and coaches held him back in his development. As a result he only re-enlisted in 1971, when he won the Hungarian championship in the hammer throw as an athlete of Építők SC, which he repeated in 1974 and 1975. In 1976, he also won the team championship with the Építók team. He was the member of the Hungarian national team between 1970 and 1976. He took part in the 1972 München Olympics, where he finished 11th, and in the 1971 and 1974 European Championships, where he finished in eighth place both times. His personal best in the hammer throw was 73.28 metres, which he achieved in 1971. In 1981, he obtained a professional coaching qualification at the College of Physical Education, which he utilized as a professional coach for the Építők SC and the Hungarian national team after finishing his active career. He stopped coaching in 1989 due to problems with making a living and continued working as a construction entrepreneur. Personal Best: HT – 73.28 (1971).",

His greatest moment, however, came at Moskva in 1980 when he had the honour of being the Mexican flagbearer at the Opening Ceremony, and followed that by winning a springboard silver and finishing fourth in the platform event. His success inspired a new generation of Mexican divers such as 1988 Seoul bronze medalist Jesús Mena. Girón went on to appear in a fourth Olympics in 1984; his medal list, however, was not confined to one Olympic silver. He won four Central American and Caribbean Games gold medals (1974 and 1978), one gold, one silver and two Pan American Games medals (1975 and 1979) and, at Cali in 1975, he had the distinction of being the first Mexican to win a diving medal (bronze) at the World Aquatics Championships.

91969,Martin Lundström,Male,30 May 1918,,, Sweden,SWE,"Martin Lundström was born as one of 15 children, and he and his two brothers had to work on the farm, thus developing strong arms and legs. As a 13-year-old, he began to work in the woods with his father, and he skiied to school, further strengthening his legs. In 1939 Lundström was stricken with tuberculosis and spent six months in a sanatorium, but he recovered and in 1941 won his first contest as a senior. Besides skiing, he was active in race-walking in the early 1940s and during the 1950s in orienteering as a summer sport. His breakthrough came in 1943 when he outclassed all opponents in the relay with the Västerbotten District’s team, including “Mora-Nisse” Nils Karlsson, running the last leg with the best split time. In 1946, Lundström joined IFK Umeå, and was offered a job at the local sports shop, and was able to stop the hard work in the forest, allowing him to improve his training. In 1947 he won 12 of 19 starts. In St. Moritz he already won the 18 km run at the “rehearsal” for the Olympics in 1947. Nevertheless for the Olympic 18 km race he was given the first Swedish number, normally a disadvantage, and he ran quite angrily to win his first Olympic gold. In the relay, snow conditions became increasingly difficult. Lundström stopped on the anchor leg and re-waxed his ski, probably the only time this happened in an Olympic relay race. Nevertheless, Sweden’s winning margin was by far the greatest in the history of this event in Olympic history. Victory at Holmenkollen in 1948 over 18 km cemented his status as a ski king. At the 1952 Olympic Games in Oslo, he competed only in the relay, again running anchor, to secure the bronze medal. In his only three events at the Winter Olympics, Lundstrom earned two golds and one bronze medal. Between his two Olympics he was less successful at the 1950 World Championships in Rumford, Vermont, placing only eighth and ninth in the 18 km and 50 km, respectively. After the “Golden Year” of 1948, his sensitive health almost stopped his career, but despite this, he managed to remain in the Swedish elite until 1957, then 39-years-old. He participated in the Swedish Championships from 1941-57, winning six titles, including three individual, and became Swedish Team Champion with his club IFK Umeå seven times. His best position in the Vasalöppet run was third in 1955. Of his 260 competitions in this period he won almost one third and made the top three in more than half of them. He continued to compete in the Veteran World Championships, winning another 27 gold medals, the last one in 1999 at the age of 80. Lundström’s professional career continued in the forest, as he became a forest supervisor. Between 1962-83, he had his own company named “Martin’s Arms & Sport”, also in Umeå, and also worked for a number of years as a sports coach and was chairman of IFK Umeå for 17 years. Lundström was also politically active as a member of the Umeå Municipal Council and a Council Member of Västerbotten province.",Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the World Nordic Ski Championships (3–0–1 1948 St. Moritz (Olympics) CCS gold: 18 km and 4×10 km relay; 1950 Lake Placid/Rumford CCS gold: 4×10 km relay; 1952 Oslo (Olympics) CCS bronze: 4×10 km relay)

After capturing the European title the following year, he joined Adams (1982) as the only other British male to simultaneously hold both titles. Fallon also won the World Cup at Warszawa (Warsaw) in 2005. A second Olympic appearance followed in 2008, after winning the World Cup qualifying event at Birmingham the previous year.

After initially living in Adelaide, in 1955/56 he moved to Melbourne where he also changed his throwing event emphasis from shot/javelin to discus. His progression was impressive in the new event, winning at the Olympic trials in October 1956. As a Latvian national, however, he was unfortunately ineligible to represent Australia at the Games.

Unlike team-mates Ernest Appleyard, Guy Clarkson, Chris Mackintosh, and Alex Keiller, however, Currie never started in either of the events he was entered for. Currie was the son of a Glasgow earthenware manufacture, and went on to enjoy a successful Army career, before working for the Glasgow company of J. & P. Coats. He was educated at Janefield school in Bearsden before going to the Glasgow Academy, where Currie was in the school rugby first XV. He joined the Glasgow Highlanders in 1912 and rose to the rank of major in the 18th Highland Light Infantry. During World War I, he saw service in France and was injured twice, in 1915 and 1918. Currie was awarded the Military Cross (MC) in 1917 for his bravery in rescuing an injured colleague at Ypres. Injured just 50 yards from enemy lines, Currie dragged him to safety despite being under heavy machine-gun fire. After military service, Currie joined Coats of Paisley who were one of the world’s leading industrial thread manufacturers at the time. His job took him to the Baltic States, where he became an excellent cartographer and acquired a great knowledge of the Finnish landscape. He lived and worked in Norway in between the two World Wars, and it was during his time there that he improved his skiing skills. Currie and his wife later lived in Sweden, where their son Gilbert was born in 1935. He was named after Currie’s brother Gilbert, who was killed in action in 1916. Currie was recalled from the Army Reserve List at the start of World War II and after fighting in the 1940 Norwegian Campaign was attached to Military Affairs at the Ministry of Information in London, and it was there in 1944 that he lost his life when killed by enemy action.",Listed in Olympians Who Were Killed or Missing in Action or Died as a Result of War (Lost his life through enemy action while working in London.)

920545,Charles Simpson,Male,8 May 1885,,, Great Britain,GBR,"Charles Walter Simpson was the son of Major General C. R. Simpson of the Lincolnshire Regiment. Due to a riding accident Charles could not join the Army and was largely self-taught, but he studied for a while in 1904 with Lucy Kemp Welsh, who was well known for her horse paintings. In 1910, he worked at the Académie Julian in Paris. In 1913 Simpson married fellow artist Ruth Alison and a few years later they started a painting school at St. Ives. Simpson mainly painted landscapes, and bird and sporting motifs. He also wrote and illustrated a number of books. From 1913-24 the Simpsons lived in London but they later returned to Cornwall. Charles Simpson competed four times in the Olympic art competitions: 1924, 1928, 1932 and 1948, but was never able to win a medal or achieve an Honorable Mention. From the numerous pictures that he submitted over time, a number could be identified with a high degree of probability. These include for 1924 _ La chasse à la loutre, victim_,probably Otter Hunting, The Kill, oil on canvas, 61 x 91.4 cm, now in the Derby Museum; and La chasse aux canards, l’affut en bateau actually Duck Shooting, The Punt Gunner, 1924 oil on canvas, 199 x 226 cm, now on display at the Russell-Cotes Museum. Less clear are Canards sauvages au clair de lune, possibly identical to 1922’s The Flight of the Wild Duck and Cygnes sauvages. Even in the early version of the catalogue, the latter two works are listed under different names. The title Chasse aux Loutres appeared again in the 1928 catalog. This could well be again the painting already exhibited in 1924 or the similar work Otter Hunting, tempera on paper painting, 61 x 76 cm, which has been in the Shipley Art Gallery since 1921. Since La meute is designated as a watercolor, the title could be a short version of The Bramham Moor dog pack after a hard day (watercolor and gouache on panel, 36.8 x 52 cm). The Grand National, 1927 was created in mixed media (pencil, watercolour, gouache and oil on paper) and measures 53.3 x 73.6 cm. In 1932, Simpson again entered three paintings, all oil on canvas. Wild Duck and Water Lilies most likely corresponds to Among the Waterlilies (64 x 89 cm). The St Leger is a horse race held annually at the Doncaster Racecourse. The respective painting was acquired by the Doncaster Museum in 1931 under the title Finish of the 1931 St Leger (100 x 126 cm). Through the years, the artist painted a whole series of pictures of the Grand National, the famed British horse steeplechase. In this case, the actual entry can be identified by the illustration in the catalog. Finally, in 1948, Simpson submitted the painting Sunrise on the Estuary. This may be the work On an Estuary, a print of which was sold together with Simpson’s book “The fields of home - A book of English field and hedgerow, coastline and moorland”.",

In the latter year he joined the Trail Smoke Eaters of the Western International Hockey League and, aside from brief appearances with several other teams, stayed with them through 1962. In 1961 he was a runner-up for the Allan Cup, a trophy given annually to the Canadian senior amateur men’s ice hockey champions, and was selected with the rest of his squad to represent his nation at that year’s World Championships. The Trail Eaters captured the title, the nation’s last with an amateur squad and until 1994, and Martin was honored as the tournament’s best goaltender in addition to being named to the All-World All-Star Team. This was the start of a successful international career that saw four more appearances at the World Championships (1963, 1964, 1966, and 1967, the latter two of which netted him bronze medals), three more honors as best goaltender (1963, 1964, and 1966), two more selections for the All-World All-Stars (1964 and 1966), and a trip to the 1964 Winter Olympics, where Canada finished in a controversial fourth place. He was also noted as the first goaltender to wear a mask in international competition. Domestically, Martin skated for several teams in the WIHL for the remainder of his career, including the Rossland Warriors (for whom he would later become general manager), the Nelson Maple Leafs, the Kimberley Dynamiters, and the Spokane Jets, with whom he played his final full season in 1969-1970, the year that they became the first American team to win the Allan Cup. During the 1967-1968 season he played 32 games with the St. Louis Blues of the National Hockey League and made the finals for the Stanley Cup but, believing that he would never appear in enough professional hockey matches to earn a pension, he returned to the firefighting job that he had worked in British Columbia for the past 12 years and remained there until his retirement in 1992. He played several games with the Spokane Jets and the Western Hockey League’s Portland Buckaroos during the 1972-1973 season, but bowed out of the sport for good after that.

53954,Ted Temme,Male,16 September 1904,,, Great Britain,GBR,"Ted Temme was a two-time Olympian. However, he was better known as the “King of the Channel” for not only making the crossing of the English Channel from France to England in 1927, but in 1934 by making history as the first person to swim it in both directions. The son of a London bootmaker, Temme started swimming at the age of 11 during his time at the Water Lane School. He was always destined to be a champion long-distance swimmer, and in 1925 finished third in the ASA Long-Distance Championship on the River Thames (he also finished third in 1928). A member of the Plaistow United Swimming Club, Temme joined their water polo team and went on to captain them, as well as skippering Essex and England. He made his first successful Channel swim in 1927 and the following year made the swim across the Bristol Channel from Penarth to Weston-Super-Mare. Shortly after that he got called up to the Great Britain water polo team for the Amsterdam Olympics. He then went on to captain Britain at the 1930 European Games in Nuremberg. However, Channel swimming had become his priority, and he probably missed out on selection for the 1932 Olympics because of his dedication to training for his record-breaking swims, and between 1928-33 he had four failed attempts at making the crossing from England to France, before successfully achieving it in 1934. The year before, Temme had won the Dutch Long-Distance Swimming Championship and also became the first man to make a double crossing of the Bristol Channel when he swam from Weston to Penarth, Temme appeared in his second Olympics in 1936 but retired from international competition shortly afterwards following incidents at the Berlin Games that he was not happy with. Temme worked for the Cornhill Insurance Group upon leaving school, and went on to captain their swimming club, as well as the Lloyds Insurance team. He later became superintendent at Surbiton Baths before being appointed manager of Nottingham Baths in 1939, and later manager of the Newport Baths in Monmouthshire. In 1950 Temme was the supervisor for the first Daily Mail Cross Channel Race which his second wife, Dutch-born “Willy” took part in. Temme’s son John was an England international water polo player in the 1950s, as was his wife “Willy”, who set a record for the 16-mile swim across Lake Windermere in 1955 as she became first woman to swim the lake in both directions. Ted Temme died while on holiday in Italy with his third wife Hilda, in 1978. Because some records were believed to have been destroyed when the Channel Swimming Association (CSA) offices in Dover were bombed during World War II, Temme’s record-breaking swim of 1934 was not officially recognised until 30 years later when he received a letter from the CSA offering him a certificate commemorating his record-breaking achievement – if he paid them a fee of six guineas (£6.30) for the privilege.",Listed in Olympians Who Swam the English Channel (1928 Olympics - Water Polo; Swam English Channel - 1927 France-to-England (?) and 1934 England-to-France (15:34).

He participated in four consecutive Olympic Games, representing East Germany in 1988 at Seoul, and re-unified Germany at Barcelona (1992), Atlanta (1996), and Sydney (2000). In 1988, he won the team silver medal and finished eighth on the horizontal bar. In the individual all-around he placed 30th. In 1992, Wecker was an unfortunate fourth in both the team and individual all-around events. He also reached all apparatus finals except the horse vault. Wecker won silver on the horizontal bar and two bronze medals, on the rings and the pommelled horse. On both the floor exercise and the parallel bars he came seventh. In 1996, Wecker finished seventh with the team and 13th in the individual all-around. On the horizontal bar he crowned his career with the gold medal. In 2000, the team finished a disappointing tenth and Wecker placed 30th in the individual all-around and did not reach an apparatus final. Wecker was also World Champion in 1995 and European Champion in 1989 and 1992, all on the horizontal bar. He added 14 more World Championship medals. Domestically, he won more than 40 national medals in both the former GDR and re-unified Germany. Wecker founded his own company organizing gymnastics events in 2000, but went bankrupt after a divorce battle with his first wife. In 2006, he fell ill with Crohn’s disease but fully recovered. Since 2008, Wecker headed a company in Bend, Oregon that produced plant germ oils.

His other full international caps came during England’s tour of Central Europe in June 1908 and he made the last of his amateur international appearances in 1913. Bailey, who was employed by the Midland Railway as a rating official, was rather below the average height of first-class goalkeepers but he was the outstanding amateur keeper of his time. He first signed with Derby County in 1899 and then played for Ripley Athletic and Leicester Imperial before joining Leicester Fosse in 1907. He was the first player from the Leicester Fosse club to be capped, and played a major part in their promotion to the Division of the Football League at the end of the 1907-08 season.

After many years sailing various craft, Mordini, nicknamed “U Menegu” by fellow sailors, was chosen for the 1936 Olympics following pressure from the Facist Party who wanted a “son of the Italian people” competing in the sailing events at the Games. Not only did he compete, but as a member of the crew aboard Italia, he helped Italy win the 8-metre gold medal. Italia was built at the Attilio Costaguta shipyard at Genova Voltri and was launched only a couple of months before the Olympics. She was taken by train to Germany, and immediately impressed on the Kiel waters, particularly in medium-strong winds. At the Olympics, the Swedes were the early leaders but, by the time it came to the seventh and final race, Italy led the Norwegians by just one point and they held them off in the final race to take gold medal. However, the race was probably decided in race five after a series of protests following many collisions. The eventual placings were not resolved until all races had been completed when the jury then consulted with the German film director Leni Riefenstahl who was making an official film of the Olympics from an airship above the regatta. The victory for the Italians was confirmed and uniquely it meant they had won with an Italian crew in a boat designed and built in Italy. After surviving the allied bombings of Genova during World War II, Italia became the property of the publisher Angelo Rizzoli and survived the tragic earthquake of Irpinia in 1980. In 2004 Italia received recognition of national historical heritage, a unique honour for a racing boat. She continued to sail the waters of the Gulf of Napoli while being moored at Molosiglio in the nautical base of the Naval League.",Listed in Olympians Who Received the Italian Olympic Association (CONI) Gold Medal ()

Klika was a physician who became head of urology at Charles University in Praha, after serving as a professor urology at Comenius University in Bratislava. He also excelled at tennis (was an honorary member of LTK Bratislava); motorcycling (was an honorary member of Motorklub Bratislava), shooting; and alpinism. During World War II, Klika became the personal physician of General Alois Eliáš, who was the first head of the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia that was set up by Nazi Germany after they invaded Czechoslovakia. Elias worked with the Czech underground and sometimes, when he went to meet with them, Klika would enter false entries in Elias’s medical record that he was being treated by Klika during that time. In September of 1941, the Czech underground decided to kill seven pro-Nazi Czech journalists but did not want it to look like an assassination in order to avoid reprisals. Klika suggested using cultures of typhus, tuberculosis, and botulism injected into sandwiches which would be served to the journalists during a meeting with General Eliáš. Only five of the sandwiches would be so treated and it would take several days before they would fall ill and so the link to their meeting with Eliáš would not be obvious. Six days after the meeting, four of the journalists fell ill but three recovered and only one died. Shortly afterwards, General Eliáš’s work with the underground was discovered and he was executed by the Nazis.",

Eventually gathering 56 caps from 1919-30, including 37 as captain, Dénis would play for the Dutch national team at the 1920, 1924 and 1928 Olympics, placing 3rd in 1920 and 4th in 1924.

8727,"Floyd Mayweather, Jr.",Male,24 February 1977,162.0,57, United States,USA,"Floyd Mayweather was taught to box by his father and uncle, and came to the 1996 Atlanta Olympics after winning the National Golden Gloves title in 1993 and 1994. At Atlanta he won a bronze medal, losing a controversial semi-final decision to Bulgarian Serafim Todorov, but it was only a prelude to one of the great professional boxing careers ever. Mayweather competed professionally from 1996-2007 and 2009-15, with a one-fight comeback in 2017. During his career he held the titular crown of greatest pound-for-pound boxer in the world. He won world titles in five weight classes, and was the lineal champion in four weight classes. He retired from boxing with a record of 50 wins and no defeats, the second longest undefeated streak in professional boxing history. Mayweather twice won the The Ring magazine’s Fighter of the Year Award, in 1998 and 2007. He won the Boxing Writers’ Association Fighter of the Year in 2007, 2013, and 2015. Boxrec.com has ranked him the greatest fighter of all-time, pound-for-pound, and the greatest welterweight of all-time. Known as “Money” Mayweather, he earned huge purses during his career and for several years led the Forbes magazine list of world’s highest paid athletes. He earned over $1 billion in purses and pay-per-view royalties while fighting. Mayweather’s fights were always heavily promoted, including spectacles such as a bout with Oscar De La Hoya in May 2007, which Mayweather won by split decision. Other big fights were against Ricky Hatton, Sugar Shane Mosley, and Miguel Cotto. For years, boxing afficianados clamored for a fight between Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao, consider the other contender for world’s greatest pound-for-pound fighter. The fight finally came off in May 2015, with Mayweather winning a unanimous decision. After the fight Pacquiao claimed he was hampered by a shoulder injury that required surgery, and Mayweather offered a re-match after Pacquiao had recovered, but it never came to be. In 2017 Mayweather came out of retirement to fight Conor McGregor, a champion in MMA, who had never had a professional boxing match before. In August 2017 Mayweather defeated McGregor by TKO in the 10th round. It was Mayweather’s 50th consecutive victory, surpassing the mark of 49-0 by Rocky Marciano, heavyweight champion in the 1950s. Despite his boxing feats, Mayweather was always a controversial figure. Several times he was charged with domestic violence against women, and misdemeanor battery charges. He settled most of these charges, serving several sentences of house arrest, suspended jail sentences, and community service. All of Mayweather’s titles are difficult to enumerate, given the alphabet soup nature of professional boxing. Among the world titles he garnered were WBC super featherweight champion, WBC lightweight champion (135 lbs), WBC super-lightweight champion, IBF welterweight champion, WBC welterweight champion (twice), WBC light-middleweight champion (twice), WBA (Super) light-middleweight champion, WBA (Super) welterweight champion, and WBO welterweight champion. Mayweather was known as a mostly defensive fighter. Among his 50 wins he had 27 knockouts, but most of those came early in his career against journeyman boxers. Mayweather is almost universally considered the greatest defensive fighter of all-time, in any class.","Listed in Olympic Boxers Who Won a Professional World Championship (Olympics - 1996 Featherweight (Bronze); Professional World Champion - WBC Super-Featherweight (1998-2002); WBC Lightweight (2002-2004); WBC Light-Welterweight (2005-2005); IBF Welterweight (2006-2006); WBC Welterweight (2006-2008); WBC Light-Middleweight (2007-2007); WBC Welterweight (2011- 2015);WBA Welterweight (2014-2016); WBA Light Middleweight (2012-2016 ); WBO Welterweight (2015)) Listed in Olympians With a Net Worth > $100M ($340M (Forbes, 2016)) Listed in Olympians Who Fought at WrestleMania ()"

The king’s answer was: “I would like to see Brusveen join the Squaw Valley squad”, and the Olympic committee included him on the team. He won the 15 km at Squaw Valley, thanks to his excellent finish, after a close battle with Sixten Jernberg. Brusveen skied the last leg for Norway in the relay and had a 20 second lead over Finland, but was overtaken by Veikko Hakulinen in the final stage of the race and was beaten to silver by only 0.8 seconds.

Returning to Ottawa, Ontario, he coached judo and martial arts at the family operated Takahashi Dojo, and taught high school at Confederation and J.S. Woodsworth. He graduated with a diploma in Recreation and Leisure Studies from Algonquin College, a Bachelor of Physical Education from the University of Ottawa, and a Bachelor of Education from the University of Saskatchewan. The Takahashi’s were Canada’s legendary martial arts family. He was the son of Masao (8th degree Black Belt and former NATO combat instructor) and June (one of the first Canadian women to earn a Black Belt in judo and one of the highest-ranked women in the country with a 6th degree black belt). In 2005, Takahashi co-authored the family’s book, “Mastering Judo”, along with his siblings Allyn, Ray (1976 and 1984 wrestling Olympian) and Tina (Canada’s first ever judo gold medalist at the World University Games in 1984, and 1988 Olympic coach). Takahashi held the rank of 7th degree Black Belt, and was inducted into the Nepean Wall of Fame, Judo Ontario Hall of Fame and Judo Canada Hall of Fame in 1996. A father of three girls, after a short battle with cancer, Takahashi passed away in Ottawa at the age of 63.",Brother of Ray Takahashi Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the Summer Pan American Games (0–0–2 1979 San Juan JUD bronze: extra-lightweight -60 kg; 1983 Caracas JUD bronze: extra-lightweight -60 kg)

In 1900 a private court was built at the family’s palatial residence at Lakewood, New Jersey and apart from retaining Frank Forester as his personal professional until 1915, Jay Gould also engaged many other professionals to provide both tutoring and competition. When only 17, Gould won the U.S. Amateur Championship and held the title until his retirement from singles play in 1926. He was also the first amateur ever to win the World Championship (in 1914) and in 1908 Jay Gould won the Olympic jeu de paume competition without the loss of a set. Gould was equally outstanding as a doubles player, winning eight U.S. titles with W. T. H. Huhn and a further six titles with Joseph Wear, the 1904 Olympic tennis bronze medalist. Throughout his career, Gould lost only once in both singles and doubles. Gould was also a very capable squash racquets player. Gould never had to work, but did manage the family fortune and real estate interests from offices in New York City – into which he had a court tennis dedans built. In an obscure Olympic relation, Gould was the great-great-uncle of USA cyclist Georgia Gould, who competed in 2008-12.",Brother-in-law of John Beresford

She was certainly no stranger to the world of sports – her father, John E. Mullen, worked for the swimming committee of the 1930 British Empire Games and Irene herself had participated in local and national women’s basketball championships for several years and played on a successful city softball team. When the new civic swimming pool was built for the 1930 British Empire Games, she won the first ever race held in the pool (a demonstration event) and took home a large, ornate trophy for her achievements. It was rumored that her father had influenced the schedule so that the race in which Irene was the strongest would be held first, thus giving her the best chance of capturing the prize. At the 1932 Summer Olympics, Mullen’s best hope at taking home a gold medal came in the 4 x 100 metre Freestyle Relay, but her team (consisting of Mullen, Ruth Kerr, and British Empire Games silver medalists Irene Pirie-Milton and Betty Edwards) finished fourth in a field of five nations. She also competed in the 100 metre individual freestyle event, but was eliminated in the first round. Shortly thereafter she retired from swimming entirely, for reasons unknown to even her own family, and never swam again – competitively or otherwise.

95680,Mika Myllylä,Male,12 September 1969,183.0,74, Finland,FIN,"Mika Myllylä, who holds a record for winning 23 Finnish cross-country titles during his career, is considered to be one of the most successful Finnish skiers, despite being caught with positive doping tests. In his prime, in the 1990s, Myllylä won six Olympic medals and nine World Championships medals, but later admitted that he doped his entire career. Myllylä made his international début at the 1992 Olympics, but did not medal, his best being 14th in the 10 km. Myllylä also did not medal at the 1993 World Championships, but a year later surprised everyone by winning silver at 50 km and bronzes in the 30 km and relay at the 1994 Winter Olympic. Before the Olympics, the best places Myllylä had achieved at the World Cup races, were third places in both Kavgolovo and Olso at the start of 1994, just before the Olympics. After the Olympics, Myllylä established himself as one of the top male distance skiers. The 1995 World Championships were not the best for Myllylä as he won only bronze over 10 km, but in the following top tournaments, Myllylä was the top contender for gold medals in the distances. Myllyla was the World 50 km champion at the 1997 World Championships and Olympic 30 km champion in 1998. He also won two silvers (pursuit and relay) and bronze (10 km) in 1997 and two bronzes (10 km and relay) in 1998. The best international tournament for Myllylä was the 1999 World Championships in Ramsau, where he ruled the ski courses by winning almost everything there was to win. Myllylä won golds at 10 km, 30 km and 50 km, while taking silvers in the pursuit and relay. At the start of the 2000s, Myllylä was on his way to become one of the greatest stars in cross country skiing history, and went to the 2001 World Championships, held in his hometown of Lahti, as the favorite at every distance, but was caught using hydroxyethyl starch (HES), a blood plasma expander usually used to cover up the use of erythropoietin (EPO), with five other Finnish male top skiers during the Championships. Myllylä received a two-year suspension from the FIS and tried a comeback after his sentence, but not very successfully and finished his sporting career in 2005. During his sporting career, Myllylä’s fondness for alcohol was well known and, after his retirement, his drinking problems worsened. In January 2008, he was caught drunk driving and was sentenced to 40 days in prison. In 2009 Myllylä was caught drunk driving once more, and three more times in 2010 and each time was sentenced to 30-40 days in prison. In addition to his drunk driving offenses, Myllylä was also in court because of his doping use and in spring of 2011 gave a sworn statement where he admitted using EPO during his entire career. In the morning of 5 July 2011, Myllylä’s lifeless body was found at his home. Although no official cause of death was released, the media speculated that he committed suicide. At the time of his death, the court case about his doping use was still on-going.","Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the World Nordic Ski Championships (4–3–2 1995 Thunder Bay CCS bronze: 10 km; 1997 Trondheim CCS gold: 50 km, silver: 10/15 km pursuit and 4×10 km relay, bronze: 10 km; 1999 Ramsau CCS gold: 10 km, 30 km, and 50 km, silver: 10/15 km pursuit)"

Nevertheless, it was thought to be rather surprising that Storelid was able to win two silver medals at the Lillehammer Games, both times behind Koss. In later years, Storelid remained a top distance skater, but he was never able to return to his 1994 form. Although he won a number of distance medals at All-Around championships, his shorter distances were insufficient to allow for overall medals, except when he won the 1997 Norwegian All-Around title. Storelid, who won two World Cup races (1994 and 1997), retired after the Salt Lake City Winter Olympics. He later worked as an engineer at Oslo’s energy company.

Born in Torre Annunziata in the outskirts of Napoli, he began to work in the municipal slaughterhouse as a boy and, with his uncommon strength, relatives and friends pushed him to start boxing. At 16 he fought in the youth categories and met with Mariano Fabbrocino who, with his helpfulness, enthusiasm and expertise, helped Bergamasco to make headway in the world of boxing. After two Italian titles, the silver medal at the 1970 CISM World Championships held in Abidjan, and participation at the 1971 European Championships and Mediterranean Games, Bergamasco was chosen for the light-welterweight division at the 1972 Munchen Olympics. On 30 August he debuted against Bantow Srisook, a member of the Thai Navy. Bergamasco, however, acted erratically and conceded the win to Srisook, who only had to take advantage of the Italian’s eccentric behavior. For the first two rounds, in fact, Bergamasco danced throughout the ring without the slightest attack, allowing his opponent to take the advantage. In the third round Bergamasco’s actions were confused and ineffective and Srissok defeated him easily. After this great Olympic disappointment, Bergamasco turned professional in November 1972 and won his first match by decision against Ottavio Quaresmini. On 25 September 1974 he lost by injury during the second round of his first challenge for the Italian super lightweight title against Bruno Freschi. Four years later he had another opportunity to be Italian champion, but he lost once again by injury against Giuseppe Martinese in Milano in February 1978. It was Bergamasco’s last match, and he recorded a professional record of 31 wins (9 by KO) and 10 losses (6 by KO). After finishing his active career, Bergamasco became the founder and director of one of the most successful boxing clubs in the Napoli area, the Pugilistica Oplonti, where as a coach he brought to the ring many valuable fighters. Among them were his son Raffaele (an amateur Italian champion) and the professionals Alfonso Pinto and Pietro Aurino, both Olympians.",

The following year Dora made the first of her 14 Wimbledon appearances but went out in the second round. She reached the semi-finals in 1908 where she was beaten by Charlotte Sterry (née Cooper) and just over a week later Dora was the Olympic Games silver medalist – without winning a set. She received byes in her first two rounds and was then beaten in two straight sets by Dorothea Lambert Chambers in the final. However, success was not far away from Dora and she started 1909 by winning the mixed doubles at the All-England Badminton championships with Albert Prebble and then went on to win the singles title at Wimbledon by beating Agatha Morton in the final. She also reached the final of the Open mixed doubles event with Prebble but lost to Morton and Henry Roper Barrett. To make 1909 a memorable year for Boothby she also won the Covered Court championship at Queen’s Club and the South of England championship at Eastbourne, along with many other events across the country. As the defending champion in 1910 she lost to Dorothea Lambert Chambers in the Challenge Round at Wimbledon but the following year won the the all-comers final against Edith Hannam to earn the right to challenge Chambers for the title but Boothby suffered an embarrassing 6-0, 6-0 defeat. It was the first such scoreline in a Grand Slam singles final and it would not be until the 1988 French Open final when Steffi Graf beat Nataliya Zvereva that the scoreline was repeated. Dora never got beyond the third round of the singles after that but did win the doubles in 1913 when Boothby and partner Winifred McNair were fortunate to beat Sterry and Lambert Chambers when Sterry had to retire with a torn tendon in her leg when leading 6-4, 4-2. Dora made her final Wimbledon appearance in 1922 and after her retirement turned to tennis coaching for fun but in 1932 she decided to take up coaching professionally. In 1929 she designed the first official team jackets for the Great Britain Wightman Cup team and Dora traveled with the team to Forest Hills, New York, although she did not play.",

4141,Pasqualino Morbidelli,Male,1 November 1948,164.0,57, Italy,ITA,"Pasqualino Morbidelli was an Italian boxer. Born in Allumiere near the Italian capital, he moved at a very young age to Santa Marinella and, pushed by the father, who personally brought him to the instructor Giuseppe Peris, began to attend the gym Civitavecchia Ring at the age of 16. Under the guide of Peris, who refined the boy’s qualities, Pasqualino quickly became a strong featherweight. Fast, agile and very dynamic, with a gritty and combative disposition, he was an untamable fighter. In 1969, after years in the youth category and while serving in the military, he won his first Italian title at Castelfranco Veneto. He was on the national team in four international meetings, but in 1971 he lost the final for the Italian title against Sergio Emili. In September he wore the Azzurro vest at the Mediterranean Games, where he won the bronze medal. Morbidelli had a good start to 1972, with a new national title and wins at the Athens International tournament and at the dual match against Great Britain, where he defeated the rampage of Mark Bliss. A month later, he experienced another great success at the Groningen’s tournament, after three bouts in six days on the Olympic model. At the München Games his class, the featherweight, was the most populated of the 1972 boxing tournament, with five bouts to reach the final. Morbidelli had no problems in the first two matches, both won by decision 5:0, but in the third round he fought in front of the very strong Japanese boxer Royal Kobayashi, who was a strong puncher (he became professional world champion in 1976). In the afternoon of 3 September Morbidelli was the last Italian boxer still in the competition after the elimination of Franco Udella. The bout between Morbidelli and Kobayashi was short but sportingly dramatic: after a slow start (the Mexican referee Ernesto Arcos requested much more fighting spirit), Morbidelli suffered two violent blows to the stomach halfway through the first round, which brought him to the canvas. When he collected himself two minutes later, Morbidelli retreated to the corner stool with a cry of anger and despair that touched the audience. One year later Morbidelli turned professional and, after 13 bouts with only one loss, he fought for the Italian bantam title on 23 May 1975 in Sassari against Michele Siracusa and won after 12 spectacular rounds: after 39 years – the last was the Olympic champion Vittorio Tamagnini in 1936 – the Italian title of the bantamweight returned to a boxer of the Civitavecchia Boxe school. Only two months later he lost the title against Sergio Emili after a bout where, from the second round, he fought practically with only one hand because an injury to his other thumb. After a defeat by KO in front of the Brazilian and former world champion Éder Jofre in a friendly match in Ibirapuera, Morbidelli lost the re-match with Emili. Morbidelli’s final match was a win by decision in May 1978 against Brazil’s Juan Carlos dos Santos. His career professional record was 16 wins (3 by KO), 7 losses (3 by KO) and one draw.",Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the Mediterranean Games (0–0–1 1971 İzmir BOX bronze: featherweight -57 kg)

During the war he was a member of the Cervinia ski patrol, and was imprisoned. He took up racing again in 1947 at age 27. That year he set a new world record for the flying kilometer with around 160 km/hr on the Klein Matterhorn mountain in Cervinia, beating the previous record of 136 km/h by Leo Gasperl that had stood for 16 years, and Colò’s record remained unbeaten for 17 years. His “high egg position” was the precursor to the egg position still used by racers to reduce drag. However, unlike his successors, Colò used wooden skis and did not wear a helmet. Colò competed at the 1948 Winter Olympics and won the Lauberhorn downhill that year, while in 1949 he won the downhill and the combined at the Arlberg-Kandahar and the slalom at the Lauberhorn race, repeating that result in 1950. Also in 1950 he was the star of the World Championships in Aspen, Colorado, finishing first in downhill and giant slalom and second in slalom, only 3/10ths of a second behind Swiss Georges Schneider. While in North America, he won the North American Championships. At the 1952 Winter Olympics, Colò failed to defend his world title in giant slalom but won gold in the downhill, Italy’s first Olympic gold medal in alpine skiing. After the Olympics in Oslo, Colò linked his name to models of ski sportswear. According to the regulations of the time he was therefore considered a professional. In 1954 he was disqualified by the Italian Winter Sports Federation (FISI) and was now allowed to participate in subsequent races. He tried in vain to have the disqualification overturned, which had sparked a controversy among the public, but it ended his racing career. Colò won 28 medals at Italian Championships: 9 downhill, 4 in the giant slalom, 10 in the slalom and 5 in combined, winning 19 Italian titles. After his racing career, Colò became a ski instructor in his native Abetone, and worked with the development of the Pistoia ski resort and promoted the Abetone Ski Company. He constructed the first gondola and in 1973 he designed three ski slopes that descend from the Gomito mountain, named Zeno 1, 2, and 3. In 1989, FISI revoked the ban imposed on him in 1954. In 1991 he received the “A life for Skiing” award by the Abetone Ski Club and a gold medal from FISI. A heavy smoker for many years, he died in 1993 from lung cancer. The asteroid 58709 Zenocolò was named in his honor.","Listed in Olympians With Asteroids Named After Them (58709 Zenocolò) Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the World Alpine Ski Championships (3–1–0 1950 Aspen gold: downhill and giant slalom, silver: slalom; 1952 Oslo (Olympics) gold: downhill) Listed in Olympic Alpine Skiers - Gold Medalists and World Champions; Same Discipline - Different Event (Downhill: Olympic Gold - 1952; World Champion - 1950) Listed in Olympians Who Received the Italian Olympic Association (CONI) Gold Medal ()"

Arguably in the form of his life, and having started his Olympic campaign by comfortably winning both his heat and quarter-final, Redmond seemed set to qualify for the final when he broke down halfway through his semi-final when his hamstring snapped. After the pain had subsided he decided to hobble to the finish line despite the protestations of track officials. He had slowly and painfully limped into the home straight when a figure jumped out from the crowd. Redmond’s father, Jim, dodged officials and with the words “We started this together and we’re going to finish this together” helped his son over the line. This incident is regularly quoted as one of the most inspirational moments in the history of the Olympics and as a definition of the Olympic spirit. Redmond had battled injuries for most of his career but this injury was to end this career. This was not the end of his sporting endeavors however and he recovered sufficiently to play basketball in the British league and to have trials with the England rugby sevens team. Later he was employed by UK Athletics as Director of Development for sprints and hurdles and was also in demand for his services as a motivational speaker.

He made his international début at the 1973 World Championships, where he finished a surprising sixth in the 200 m backstroke. In 1974, Tonelli won the 100 backstroke, 200 butterfly, 4x200 m freestyle relay, and medley relay titles and was selected to the 1974 Australian Commonwealth Games team. At the Games, Tonelli won gold in the 100 back, and silvers in 200 back and the medley relay. In 1975 Tonelli won the 100 backstroke, 200 back, 200 fly, and the medley relay at the Australian Championships and also competed at the 1975 World Championships, finishing second in the 200 back. After the World Championships, Tonelli enrolled at the University of Alabama, studying Communications and Film. At the 1976 Australian championships Tonelli won only the 100 backstroke, but it was enough to qualify him for the 1976 Australian Olympic team. At the Olympics, he finished a disappointing fourth in the 200 back and was eighth at 100 back. In 1977, he won the 100 backstroke at the US Open Championships, becoming one of the few Australians to win a US title. In 1978 Tonelli was chosen as captain of the 1978 Australian Commonwealth swimming team, but was expelled from the team shortly before the Games, because Tonelli and two of his teammates, Mark Kerry and Joe Dixon, broke curfew on American Independence Day while at training camp in Honolulu, Hawai’i. According to Tonelli, Kerry was with a girl he had met, while Tonelli and Dixon had been drinking and smoking marijuana, which was not illegal in Hawai’i at the time. In 1979 Tonelli graduated from the University of Alabama and returned to Australia, winning the 100 freestyle, butterfly and backstroke events at the 1979 Australian Championships. The following year, he repeated the freestyle and butterfly victories to gain selection for the 1980 Olympics, but then another obstacle occurred. Due to the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, several Western counties decided to boycott the Moscow Olympics and Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser, who was also the patron of the Australian Olympic Committee, felt significant political pressure to also boycott. Tonelli took a leadership role among the Australian athletes, fighting for their right to compete, and adopting populist tactics in championing the athletes’ cause, saying that only the athletes would suffer and that trade relations would continue unabated, saying that Fraser was sending “wheat to feed the Russian army, wool to clothe the army and Australian metal to make Russian guns.” Tonelli finally got his wishes as Australia competed at Moscow, although with a clause that if individual athletes did not wish to compete, they did not have to, which left many Australian top athletes at home. At the Olympics, Tonelli finished seventh in the 100 back before winning a medley relay gold medal. Tonelli retired from competitive swimming after the 1980 Olympics, and started to work as a sports administrator, completing a term on the Australian Sports Commission. Tonelli was an expert swimming commentator at the 1984 and 1988 Olympics for Australian national television and since 2004 he has been a swimming commentator on Sky News Australia. Outside swimming, he worked at a children’s cerebral palsy hospital in Brisbane in the 1980s before opening his own swimming school. He later worked as a real estate agent and corporate speaker.

In winter he had to ski to and from school, which developed his skiing ability. He won his first local cross-country competition at age 20 in 1940, but joined the sports boycott during the German occupation during World War II. At the 1946 Holmenkollen, Jære finished 10th in the 50 km on borrowed skies. After placing an impressive third over 50 km at the 1947 Holmenkollen, finishing as the best Norwegian behind the Swedes Nils Karlsson and Arthur Herrdin, “The Bear from Trollheimen” was selected for the 1948 Games for his preferred event, the demanding 50 km race. The Olympic 50 km in St. Moritz was a difficult race for Jære, who had to re-wax his skies three times and ended in a distant 10th, almost half-an-hour behind the Olympic Champion “Mora-Nisse” Karlsson. Martin Jære ended his career after the 1949 season, and used his strength on his mountain farm to make a living for his family. At age 93, he moved to a nursing home in the Oppdal municipality center, where he died two years later, almost 96 years of age.",

On the track he won the AAA title at 4 miles (1926) and 10 miles (1925, 1928) and was the Midland Counties Champion at 4 miles (1925-26, 1929) and 10 miles (1924). He was, however, seen at his best in the steeplechase, winning the AAA title for four successive years (1925-28) and the English AAA title twice (1924-25). At the Midland Championships he was the winner of the steeplechase for 11 of 12 years between1925-36, only failing to take the title in 1931 when he was under suspension. After winning his fourth consecutive AAA steeplechase title, he was rated as a likely medalist for the 1928 Olympics, but before he had the opportunity to take on the worlds best he was suspended for a very minor infringement of the rules involving the promotion of a patent medicine. In February 1931, Webster, who earned a modest living as a school caretaker in Wolverhampton, was again in trouble with the authorities and, along with two other Birchfield Harriers, was suspended for life for irregularities over traveling and accommodation expenses involving a meeting in Glasgow. The athletes were reinstated after 12 months but were only permitted to compete in English meetings. These were no more than minor blemishes on Webster’s superb career, the highlight of which was probably his double victory at the 1926 AAAs when he won both the steeplechase and the 4 miles within the space of two hours. He served in the Royal Artillery in the war and saw action in Italy where he was killed in a traffic accident involving military and civilian vehicles after the cessation of hostilities and only one month before he was due to be demobilized.

Heid competed in the 1948 World Championships in the sprint, but without success. In 1949 he placed second at the Grand Prix de Copenhagen for amateurs. Remaining an amateur throughout most of his European stay, he survived by selling smuggled bike parts, bike clothes, and watches on his various trips. His biggest victory in Europe came in a sprint at the Manchester Wheelers Meet in 1949. At the 1949 World Championships, Heid lost in the semi-finals in the sprint, but won the match race for the bronze medal, defeating Émile Lognay of France, becoming the first American to win a World Championships medal since 1912. In early 1950, Heid settled in England, still competing as amateur but making money under the table, and doing better than many pros. In England he often trained with Reg Harris and Sid Patterson. After turning professional in mid-1950, he was considered a possible winner of the 1950 World Championships in the sprint. There he defeated world champions Jef Scherens and Jacques Bellenger, but lost out to Arie van Vliet , and finished only eighth. Heid returned to the US in March 1951, and took a job as a maintenance worker. He later returned to cycling a bit in 1957, riding in several six-day races in the United States.

Although selected for the two cross country events at the 1924 Winter Olympics, he started in neither. Born in the Bramley district of Leeds, Appleyard was educated at Leeds High School and then Leeds University, where he obtained a B.Sc. His first job was as a teacher before becoming H. M. Inspector of Factories from 1909-16. He then served three years as a captain in the Royal Flying Corps (later the RAF). On demobilisation from the RFC, Appleyard founded Appleyard of Leeds Limited, which went in to become one of the biggest and most respected motor dealers in the area, selling prestigious cars like Jaguar and Daimler. Whilst Ernest had little success as a skier, his two sons, Geoffrey and Ian, were both excellent skiers. Geoffrey (MC and DSO) was killed in action during World War II, but he had won British skiing’s oldest event, the Roberts of Kandahar Trophy, in 1939. Ernest’s other son Ian, who later became MD of the Appleyard Group, was a Yorkshire county tennis player and, in 1948, an Olympic skier. He became better known, however, as one of Britain’s foremost rally drivers in the 1950s and competed in some of the best-known rallies of the day, including the Monte Carlo and Alpine Rallies.

In 1882 his father took up an appointment as a tire-maker to the Earl of Shrewsbury. Bill was later sent to Paris by the Earl to set up a branch of the wheel and tire business, which was near Port d’Asnieres. Bill Burgess settled in Paris, living there for the remainder of his life and marrying a French woman, and he would eventually be interned briefly by the Germans during World War II. Burgess competed in the swimming events held during the 1900 Paris World’s Fair, which are considered as the Olympic swimming competitions. Although he was a British citizen throughout his life, at the 1900 Olympics he swam for the French club, Libellule de Paris. Burgess’s main claim to fame as a swimmer, however, came in 1911 when, after 13 failed attempts, he became the second man to swim the English Channel, after Matthew Webb in August 1875, finishing in 22 hours, 35 minutes. It would not be until 1923 that a third successful crossing would be made, by Henry Sullivan, and in 1926, Burgess, by then a swim coach, would train American Trudy Ederle in her successful attempt to become the first woman to swim the Channel. Burgess received a gold cup for his Channel crossing, which was exhibited for many years at the Great Smith Street Baths in London.

Coming from a wealthy background, Rowe was educated at Eton, where he first learned to row, and in his final year was both the captain of boats, and president of Pop, the prefect’s organization. After leaving school, he joined the Royal Navy submarine service in 1942, and two years later was posted to the Far East where, in 1945, he was involved in the liberation of Hong Kong from the Japanese. After the War, Rowe was offered a scholarship at Trinity College, Oxford, and revived his rowing career, becoming a double Blue, in 1948 and 1949. They lost to Cambridge both times, and in the latter year, Rowe was president of the Oxford University Boat Club. Rowe was a fine sculler and reached the semi-final of the single sculls at the 1948 London Olympics. At Henley in 1949, he won the Stewards Cup with the Trinity coxless fours, and in the Wingfield Sculls that year, was beaten in the final by the defending champion Farn Carpmael. However, Rowe’s finest moment was in 1950, when he became the first English-winner of the Diamond Sculls at Henley since Tom Askwith in 1933. Later in 1950, Rowe won the single sculls silver medal at the British Empire Games behind the 1948 Olympic and Diamond Sculls winner, Merv Wood of Australia. Rowe coached the Oxford crew on four occasions and also embarked on a successful career in printing in 1954. As the managing director of Western Printing Services, he took a gamble in 1960 to print Lady Chatterley’s Lover for Penguin Books, after the original printers, Hazell, Watson and Viney pulled out of the deal for fear of prosecution because of the controversial nature of the book. Other printers were approached, but refused on the same grounds, but then, the Pitman subsidiary Western Publishing, stepped in. The decision to print D. H. Lawrence’s novel certainly paid off for Rowe, Penguin and Western.","Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the British Empire/Commonwealth Games (0–1–0 1950 Auckland ROW silver: single sculls (competed for England)) Listed in Olympians Who Competed in the Boat Race (1948 Oxford (lost), 1949 Oxford (lost))"

With 50 m to go, Armstrong was in third place, but then surged, first past Sweden’s Anders Holmertz and then Biondi in the final five metres to claim the gold medal in a world record 1:47.25, which was considered one of the biggest upsets in Seoul.

An autodidact, he was employed in 1911 at the Art School in Charlottenburg / Berlin, despite no formal training at the time. His art style was at first Cubist-Expressionist in sculpture, but he was then influenced by futuristic and constructivist ideas. In his work “Dreiklang” (Triad) from 1919 he tried to unite the three styles of painting, sculpture and architecture. He was later influenced by the Bauhaus Movement. Still later he returned to stylized natural forms and created numerous portraits. In 1926 he created the radiator mascot for the car company “Horch”, which was never produced as the company was renamed “Audi”. In 1933 he was defamed by the Germans as a “degenerate” and, in 1944, his studio with a large part of his works was destroyed in an air raid. In 1935 he immigrated to New York, and in 1937 he went to Turkey to work at the Art Academy, accepting a post as a lecturer at Istanbul University in 1951. He returned to Germany in 1955.

He served in the Royal Canadian Air Force from 1943-45 in World War II and began painting while he was training as a pilot. He made many paintings of military life and later donated them to the War Art Museum of Canada. He achieved artistic renown in the 1950s as a member of the Painters Eleven, a loosely affiliated association of avant-garde Toronto artists, known for their work in abstract modernism. The group disbanded in 1960 and Hodgson became an instructor at the Ontario College of Art and later became a tenured professor there. Work by the Painters Eleven became quite valuable in the 1960s but Hodgson was unable to take full advantage of it. Short of materials, he later painted over some of his original canvasses. In 1993 he had further bad luck when many of his paintings were destroyed in a fire. As a canoeist, Hodgson won 12 national titles as a juvenile and junior, and nine Canadian championships as an adult. He died after a long battle with Alzheimer’s Disease.",

In the wake of the 1902 conscription laws, he changed his last name to Haapasalo and began his studies at the Finnish Art Association’s drawing school, where he then switched to sculpturing. The following year he fled abroad from Russian conscription with a falsified passport. From 1903 he studied first at the Royal Academy of Fine Arts in København and then at the Académie Colarossi in Paris. He was a student of Auguste Rodin there for a few months in 1906, whose influence was apparent in Haapasalo’s bronze figures. An example is the work The Boxers in the Paasivuori Park in Helsinki’s Siltasaari district, which was presented in the 1952 art exhibition. However, it was created as early as 1930 for a sculpture competition. The bronze sculpture was unveiled in 1932 and the models were two young boxers from Club Jyryn in Helsinki, Uuno Pitkä and Paavo Armas Wilkman (1904-57). Haapasalo created sculptures for public places and, after World War II, monuments to the war dead. His career spanned an unusually long period, and he was still creating monumental works in the late 1950s. Large bronze and granite sculptures in austere classicism were his trademark. From 1954 to 1960 he was chairman and then honorary chairman of the Finnish Sculptors Association. Haapasalo was awarded the Pro Finlandia Medal in 1953 and appointed professor in 1965. He donated his works to his hometown Mikkeli, where he also spent the last years of his life. Haapasalo’s estate formed the core of today’s Mikkeli Art Museum.",

921283,Alex Walter Diggelmann,Male,20 August 1902,,, Switzerland,SUI,"Alex Diggelmann was an orienteerist, balloonist, cross-bowman and one of Switzerland’s best-known graphic and poster artists. After three years as a primary teacher he began training as a drawing teacher. He attended the vocational school in Bern, the Académie Julian in Paris and the Academy of Book Art and Graphic Art in Leipzig. Back in Zürich, Diggelmann worked as a free-lance graphic artist and, from 1938, as a teacher at the cantonal high school. In World War II, he became famous for his Red Cross posters. For the 1948 Winter Olympics in St. Moritz, he designed the official poster and two of the four official Olympic stamps. After World War II, he designed the UEFA Cup for the European Football Union, and also the medals for the World Ski Championships that are still awarded in his design. Mostly on his trips to various Western and Southern European countries he painted landscape watercolors. He also produced murals and book illustrations. Diggelmann is one of only two artists to win three medals at the Olympic Art Competitions. The other one was author Josef Petersen, who won three silver medals. In 1936 Diggelmann won gold for the poster Arosa I. This poster is confirmed by illustrations. Posters Pontresina, Ice hockey, Female Figure Skater, Racing days, Einsiedeln, Arosa II and Chateau d’Oex could be identified with a high degree of certainty. For Gstaad I and Gstaad II, five posters from the period since 1931 are options. In 1948, a total of 11 works by Diggelmann are listed in the catalog. Of these, five were classified as Applied Arts. Apart from the medal-winning Poster, World Championship for Cycling and World Championship for Ice Hockey, the Poster for National Skiing Courses could be identified with great certainty. Probably all posters were color lithographs. Unlike the other works, World Championships for Cyclists is not explicitly labeled as a poster. Diggelmann also submitted the Roller Hockey Player, a painted round glass window. His Aviation Picture Book and Studies for Same refers to the book The Conquest of the Sea of Air. The History of Aviation from the Beginnings to the Present by Walter Dollfus (text) and Diggelmann (illustrations). It was published in Zürich in 1948 and comprises 128 pages with 60 tipped-in pictures in the format 21.5 x 30 cm. And last, but not least, there is Football Player, an unidentified oil painting. No photo is available from the work Icarus, a bas-relief made of plaster. Well-known on this subject, however, is his graphic Icarus falls from the sky as the sun melts its wings. A picture of Diggelmann’s Medal for the Swiss Roller Skating Championships on colored glass is published in a Swiss book about the 1948 Olympics.",

He was educated at Winchester and in 1894 obtained a commission in the Militia Battalion of the East Surrey Regiment before joining the 1st Life Guards in 1897 where he became a Captain and was mentioned in despatches following the Nile Expedition in 1899-1900. He served in the South African War 1901-02 and World War I. He was awarded the Distinguished Service Order (D.S.O.) and the Legion of Honour, and was made a Commander, Order of the British Empire (C.B.E.) in 1919, becoming a Privy Counsellor the following year. A cousin of Winston Churchill Guest was, between 1907-10 his private secretary, and this led Freddie to become interested in politics and in 1910 he was elected the Member of Parliament for East Dorset, a seat he would hold until 1922 when he was defeated. He was Chief Whip in David Lloyd George’s coalition Government and returned to Westminster the following year as the MP for Stroud in Gloucestershire and in 1924 became the member for Bristol North. He was finally the member for the Drake division of Plymouth after he switched allegiance from Liberal to Conservative in 1930. Guest held several ministerial posts including Lord of the Treasury and between April 1921 and October 1922 was the Secretary of State for Air, a post he enjoyed with a passion as he was a keen pilot and owned several light aircraft. Freddie Guest was a keen polo player and played the game long after many of his team-mates had retired. He still had a 5-goal handicap at the age of 49. He won a bronze medal as part of the Great Britain team at the 1924 Olympics and, although he never played in the Westchester Cup, his son Winston did, albeit for the Americans who beat England in 1939 – the last time the competition was held until 1992. His other son Raymond was a famous thoroughbred racehorse owner in England and America, and is one of a handful of men to have owned the winner of the Epsom Derby, courtesy of Larkspur, and the Aintree Grand National thanks to L’Escargot, who also twice won the Cheltenham Gold Cup. Freddie had been chairman of the Hurlingham Polo Committee and at the time of his death was the chairman of the Ranelagh Club and was succeeded by Lord Louis Mountbatten.","Listed in Olympians Who Participated in the Grand National Steeplechase as a Jockey, Trainer or Horse Owner (Co-owner of Koko, who ran in 1928)"

The height of his amateur career came when he was selected to represent South Africa at the 1952 Summer Olympics as a flyweight. He won his first four bouts against Kornel Molnár of Hungary, Leslie Handunge of Sri Lanka, Al Asuncion of the Philippines, and Han Su-An of South Korea, before being stopped by eventual gold medalist Nate Brooks of the United States. His semi-final loss, however, earned him one of the two bronze medals, the other going to the Soviet Union’s Anatoly Bulakov. Toweel turned professional the following year and won his first 20 fights, which included defeating Kalla Persson for the vacant Transvaal bantamweight title, Matthew Raaff for the vacant South African bantamweight title, Jackie O’Connor in defense of that title, and Tony Lombard for the vacant South African featherweight title. He defended the latter title twice in 1955, against Louis Klopper and Henry Bruyns, before being dealt his first loss in a bout for the British Empire and South African lightweight titles against Johnny van Rensburg. Six months later, however, Toweel defeated van Rensburg in a rematch to claim the titles and held him to a draw in a third bout. He held the titles for nearly three years, fending off additional challenges from Richie Howard, van Rensburg, and Dave Charnley, before finally losing it to Charnley in a rematch. In 1960 Toweel bested Benny Nieuwenhuizen in a bout for the vacant South African welterweight title, but lost it to Jannie Botes less than a month later due to a disqualification. After losing a final fight to Emile Griffith, Toweel retired with a record of 46-6-2.

He also won five event World Cups in giant slalom (1970-72) and slalom (1973-74). In World Cup races he won 65 podium places and 24 first places between 1969-80. In addition to his Olympic achievements, he won two gold medals at the 1974 World Championships in slalom and giant slalom and two in the combined, which were only considered as World Championships titles in 1972 and 1976, when no combined event was held at the Olympics. Even though a technical specialist, a second-place in the 1975 Streif downhill at Kitzbühel is one of his best known races, when he trailed Franz Klammer, regarded by many as the best downhill skier of all-time, by only 3/1000ths of a second. At Italian Championships Thoeni won 13 medals: one in downhill, five in giant slalom, six in slalom and one in combined, of which five were gold medals. After he retired from racing, Thoeni embarked on a coaching career, contributing to the success of Alberto Tomba, acting as his personal coach from 1989-96. He also has been coach of the Italian national team, first as technical director of the men’s team and then until 1999 as general manager of the Italian national team, both male and female. Thoeni was the Italian flag bearer during two consecutive Opening Ceremonies (1976 and 1980) and in 2006 was a bearer of the Olympic Flag during the Closing Ceremony of the Torino Winter Games in. In 1973 and 1974 he was named “Skieur d’Or”, an awarded presented by international ski journalists. Confirmation of his fame is that his name was cited in the successful song “Nuntereggae Più” by Rino Gaetano, together with those of other Italian celebrities of the time. In 1981 he was the protagonist of the film “A Hundredth of a Second” by Duccio Tessari, vaguely inspired by the tragic death of Italian skier Leonardo David and Thoeni’s legendary downhill race in Kitzbühel, but his career as an actor was short-lived. In his native Trafoi, he later managed the Bella Vista hotel that houses his trophy collection. In January 2022, the journalist Beppe Conti wrote a book about Thoeni’s life entitled Gustavo Thoeni, Olimpiadi, Mondiali, 4 Coppe, i trionfi dell’uomo e del mito (Gustavo Thoeni, Olympics, World Championships, 4 Cups, the triumphs of man and myth).","Cousin of Rolando Thoeni Listed in Olympians Who Acted in Movies (Un centesimo di secondo) Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the World Alpine Ski Championships (5–2–0 1972 Sapporo (Olympics) gold: giant slalom and combined, silver: slalom; 1974 St. Moritz gold: giant slalom and slalom; 1976 Innsbruck (Olympics) gold: combined, silver: slalom) Listed in Olympic Alpine Skiers - Gold Medalists and World Champions; Same Discipline - Different Event (Giant Slalom: Olympic Gold - 1972, World Champion - 1974) Listed in Olympians Who Received the Italian Olympic Association (CONI) Gold Medal ()"

He had finished the first run trailing the reigning World Cup slalom champion, Austrian Thomas Sykora, by 22-hundredths of a second, but completed the second run almost 1.6 seconds faster than the Austrian. A snowboarding enthusiast, who has dyed his hair white, green, and then orange/red for the 1998 Olympic season, Buraas missed Salt Lake City 2002 due to injury, and was unable to duplicate his previous Olympic success in Turin 2006, where he did not finish the slalom. Buraas competed in slalom at four World Championships, finishing eighth in 2007 in Are, Sweden, and, in the three others, was disqualified (2003) or did not finish (1999, 2001). At the World Junior Championships, Buraas won the bronze medal in the giant slalom in 1994 at Lake Placid, USA (also 25th in super-g) and had two top-20 finishes in 1993 (17th in giant slalom, 19th in super-G). Buraas’ 10 seasons on the World Cup produced one podium victory (slalom) in 2000 at Sestriere, Italy, and nine more podium finishes (four seconds, five thirds). Buraas made his international début in a 1991 FIS slalom race in Norway. In 2001, Buraas had what first appeared to be a minor spill in training in Norway, but it turned into a career-threatening injury, requiring neck surgery for two disc dislocations. He attended Norwegian Toppidrettsgymnas in Baerum, and was introduced to the sport by his engineer father Bjorn, at the age of seven.",Brother-in-law of Tiril Sjåstad Christiansen

16158,Rainer Podlesch,Male,4 October 1944,183.0,76, West Germany,FRG,"In 1968, cyclist Rainer Podlesch was a member of the West German pursuit team, but was injured after the quarter-final and replaced by Jürgen Kissner. The team then reached the pursuit final against Denmark. The Germans always led and the race looked over when, after 9 of 12 laps, a Danish rider went off the back. However, they re-grouped but still trailed at the bell. The German team then began to split, with Jürgen Kissner dropping off the pace. As his teammate Karl Heinz Henrichs passed him, Kissner’s hand appeared to touch him, possibly giving him a slight push. Germany held on to win by 3½ seconds, but Kissner was an East German defector and East Germany immediately protested that the touch had been an illegal shove. After a 15-minute conference among the judges, West Germany was disqualified, and Italy and the Soviet Union were announced as the silver and bronze medal winners. FRG officials then protested, stating that Italy and the Soviets should not be placed ahead of their riders. Another long conference ensued, and the result was announced as Denmark first and Italy third. No silver medal placement was given until a meeting of the Fédération Internationale Amateur de Cyclisme (FIAC, later the UCI) in November, when West Germany was awarded second place and their silver medals. Rainer competed again at München four years later as a member of the West German 100 km time trial team, finishing 20th. In 1978 and 1983 he won the Motor-paced World Championships and also won three silver and three bronze medals. Until his retirement in 2013 he was the motor-pacing representative for the West German Cycling Association. Podlesch’s brother Karsten was also a cyclist and Rainer’s son Carsten became the last UCI World Motor-paced champion as an amateur in 1992, and was also the very last professional champion two years later.",

At the height of his success, D’Annunzio was celebrated for the originality, power and decadence of his writing. His role in politics is controversial due to his influence on the Italian Fascists movement and his status as the alleged forerunner of dictator Benito Mussolini. He is often seen as a precursor of the ideals and techniques of Italian fascism. In 1922, shortly before the march on Rome, he was pushed out of a window by an unknown assailant, surviving although he was severely injured and did not completely recover before Mussolini had been appointed Prime Minister and hailed by the fascists as duce del fascismo. In 1924 D’Annunzio was ennobled by King Victor Emmanuel III and given the hereditary title of Principe di Montenevoso. In 1938 he died of a stroke. He was given a state funeral by Mussolini and was interred in a magnificent tomb constructed of white marble. It is unknown which of his works was submitted in 1912. In 1910, however, his novel Forse che sì, forse che no (Maybe - maybe not) about the infancy of aviation appeared. D’Annunzio lived in Paris from 1910-15 and could have been personally approached by Pierre de Coubertin, urging him to participate. In 1924 D’Annunzio was also a jury member of the art competitions.",Listed in Olympian Members of the Nobility (Principe (Prince) di Montenevoso) Listed in Olympians of Royal Blood (Principe di Montenevoso)

At the 1912 Stockholm Olympics Krigsman competed in the javelin events where he finished in 14th place in the standard discipline and in 13th place in the throw using both hands. Between 1910 and 1916 Krigsman completed the coaching courses designed by Ernst Hjertberg, a leading figure in the field, including the full instructors’ course. Krigsman’s coaching expertise was in high demand, especially abroad, with him working in Denmark (1917 to 1919), Norway (1919 to 1926), and the Netherlands (1927 to 1928). After returning to Sweden in 1928 Krigsman lived in Skåne where he worked for the sports association Malmö Allmänna Idrottsförening (MAI), helping them to become one of the best athletics associations in the country. Several Swedish athletes including Lennart Strandberg and Fred Warngård all enjoyed success via the work of the MAI while Krigsman was employed there. At the 1936 Berlin Olympics Krigsman worked for the Swedish Sports Confederation and from 1941 to 1946 he worked as a coach at the Swedish Pedestrian Association.

After the former Italian goalkeeping legend, Dino Zoff, was appointed national coach, he promised Peruzzi the number one goalkeeping spot. However, he changed his mind, and made Gianluigi Buffon the starting goalkeeper for Euro 2000, and Peruzzi decided not to take part as the third-choice goalkeeper. Peruzzi did not play for Italy again until making a substitute appearance in a friendly against Spain in April 2004, and was called up by new coach Giovanni Trapattoni for the Euro 2004 squad. Two years later, Peruzzi was number two to Buffon, as Italy went on to win their fourth FIFA World Cup.

Howey also made an immediate impact in the senior ranks by placing second in the 1990 European Senior Championships whilst still aged 16. She repeated her European success in 1991 and continued her progress by winning a bronze at the World Championships in Barcelona. Howey’s first attempt to win an Olympic title was ended by eventual champion Odalis Revé but she came through the repêchage system to claim the bronze medal. She was defeated in the finals of both World and European Championships in 1993 and added further bronze medals at the European Championships of both 1994 and 1995. After a disappointing Atlanta Olympics she briefly retired but soon returned and in 1997 gave the finest performance of her life to win the world title in the 66 kg class in Paris. Further medal successes followed in the next few years and she arrived in Sydney for the 2000 OIympics as one of the medal favourites. Again her title ambitions were thwarted by a Cuban, this time in the final by Sibelis Veranes, but at least she had the consolation of being the first British woman to win a second Olympic medal. Howey again reached the world final in 2001 but by now injuries were beginning to take their toll and she retired shortly after making her fourth and final Olympic appearance in Athens. Howey, who carried the British flag at the opening ceremony of the 2004 Olympics, turned to coaching and became lead development coach with the British Judo Association.",Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the Summer Universiade (0–1–1 1999 Palma de Mallorca JUD bronze: middleweight -70 kg; 2001 Beijing JUD silver: team)

Simon primarily drew caricatures in the magazine AZ and his own comedy newspaper De Peck Villchen, often mocking the common people – sleepy roadmen and nagging xanthippes – and occasionally the noble lords. The highlight of Simon’s work as a political cartoonist was his antifascist caricatures. After his studies at a Craft School in his home country and the Academy in München, he first worked for the satirical newspaper De Gukuk, and was then hired by the Tageblatt in 1931 as an editorial cartoonist. From April 1931 until the German invasion in 1940 Simon daily created a political cartoon for the title page of the socialist labor union newspaper.

While Bedales specialised in the arts, it was not noted for producing sportsmen and women, but Johnston was the exception: an outstanding athlete whowas twice the Hampshire Schools mile champion. He was also a keen cyclist. During his last term at Bedales, Johnston joined the Portsmouth AC. At Trinity, Johnston went on to win his athletics Blue and was soon identified as a top cross-country runner. He used to train with the 1960 Olympic 1500 metres champion Herby Elliott, who was at Cambridge at the same time. Johnston won the 1963 and 1965 CAU Inter-Counties Cross-Country titles and was second to Mel Batty in the 1965 English Championships. Johnston came close to winning a AAAs title in 1964 when he finished third in the steeplechase. He was a double champion in 1968, however, when he won both the AAA marathon and 6-mile titles, the latter in a British record 27:22.17. It was the last time the 6-mile was held, because it became the 10,000 metres from 1969. He was also 3-times the Southern Counties Cross-Country champion and competed in the International Cross Country-Championships five times between 1963-69, finishing second to Gaston Roelents at Barry, Wales, in 1967. In 1965 Johnston set a 30,000 metres track world record 1-32:34.6 Johnston qualified as a solicitor in 1967 but, having won the Olympic marathon trials, he spent a large part of 1967-68 in Mexico City acclimatising himself to the demanding conditions of the forthcoming Games. He competed in the marathon and gave a good account of himself before getting a “stitch” at 25 km, but still managed to finish a creditable eighth. Johnston was hoping to compete at the 1972 Olympics but an Achilles’ tendon injury ended those hopes and, in 1976, he came close, at the age of 35, to gaining selection for the Montréal Games. Despite qualifying as a solicitor, Johnston enjoyed history and languages more. He taught English for a while and then got a job as a lawyer-linguist with the European Economic Community (EEC) and later worked as a legal translator for the International Court of Justice in The Hague, before eventually retiring at the age of 65. He continued running well into his 40s, taking part in veteran’s races and won European Masters titles. He was the Seniors’ World Marathon champion in 1982 and 1983. In 2016 Johnston wrote His Own Man, the biography of Otto Peltzer, champion athlete, Nazi victim, and Indian hero. The book was illustrated by Don Macgregor, the 1972 Olympic marathon runner.

He played in the 1904 Olympic tournament as the heavy favorite to win the individual title, having in that year already won both the U.S. and Western Amateurs. But he lost in the finals to the Canadian, George Lyon. Egan was also low man for the Western GA team which won the team event. In 1905, Egan repeated as US Amateur champion. He would play in that tournament until 1910 when he moved to the West Coast, but he returned to competition after World War I and continued playing in the Amateur until 1935 – 33 years after his first appearance. His last shot at winning came in 1929 when he went to the semi-finals before losing. In 1934, Egan was named to the Walker Cup team and remains the oldest American to ever play in that event (through 2022). Among Egan’s other titles can be counted the 1902 NCAA Championship (team and individual) while at Harvard, four Western Amateurs, two California Amateurs, five Pacific Northwest Amateurs, and he was twice low amateur in the US Open – in 1904 and 1906 (when he finished eighth overall). Egan moved to Oregon in 1910 where he ran an orchard business. However, his hobby became his main career – golf course architecture. He went into partnership with the famed architect Alistair Mackenzie, with whom he helped design and redesign several courses. Egan also assisted Jack Neville with some of the design of the Pebble Beach Golf Links.","Cousin of Walter Egan Listed in Olympic Champion Golfers Who Won Major Championships (Olympic Gold – 1904: US Amateur 1904, 1905)"

Although plagued by injuries in the later years of his career he won 15 ATP tour singles title and reached a high of 4th in the world rankings.

Baker then worked as a freelance artist, initially designing mainly stamps, propaganda, and advertising posters. One of his few sports motifs was the boxers on a cover of Fortune magazine from April 1931, but it is not known whether this is the print submitted for the art competitions. The covers for Fortune gave him his breakthrough. After a financial dry spell during the Great Depression, Baker mostly worked for Time.

Khabibulin had been drafted by the Vancouver Canucks of the NHL in 1992 and joined the team in 1994. In his first NHL season, in Phoenix, as the Jets became the Phoenix Coyotes, Khabibulin did not see much ice time, participating in only 26 games and spending much of his time with the Jets American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate Springfield Falcons. But starting in the next season, Khabibulin played more than 60 games per season with the Coyotes until the 1999-00 season. Khabibulin did not play in the NHL for most of the 1999-00 season due to a contract dispute with the Coyotes and spent that season with Long Beach Ice Dogs of the International Hockey League (IHL), winning a James Gatschene Memorial Trophy as the league MVP that season. In 2001, Khabibulin was traded to the Tampa Bay Lightning and played there until the lockout cancelled 2004-05 season. With the Lightning, Khabibulin won a Stanley Cup in 2004. During the NHL 2004-05 lockout season, Khabibulin played in Russia with Ak Bars Kazan and in 2005 signed a four-year, $27 million deal with the Chicago Blackhawks, making him the highest paid goalie in the league. From 2009-13, Khabibulin played with the Edmonton Oilers and in 2013 he rejoined the Chicago Blackhawks. Internationally Khabibulin won his first awards at the 1991 European Junior Championship, where he won a silver medal, and at the 1992 World Junior Championship, where he won a gold medal. Khabibulin was also selected to the Unified Team’s 1992 Olympic team as a third goaltender, but did not play a single minute during the Olympics. The decision not to use him during the Olympics led Khabibulin into conflict with Viktor Tikhonov, who was the long-time head coach of the Soviet and later Russian national teams. This was the main reason that Khabibulin was not called up to the Russian team at most major international tournaments during 1990s and early 2000s, although Khabibulin was clearly one of the top Russian goalies at that era. He played at the 1996 World Cup and 2002 Winter Olympics, when Tikhonov was not with the Russian team, winning a bronze medal at both tournaments. Khabibulin was also named to the 2006 Russian Olympic team after Tikhonov had retired from coaching, but he did not play due to injury.",

920850,Lauro De Bosis,Male,9 December 1901,,, Italy,ITA,"Lauro de Bosis was a philosopher and philologist who also translated ancient texts into Italian. His family came from Ancona. His father Adolfo was an industrialist but also a poet and his mother was a writer and poetry lover of American descent. One of his sisters was a well-known scientist in Arabic and Islamic studies and one of his brothers a highly decorated pilot who was killed in World War I. He started to write verses by the age of seven, and graduated in chemistry in Roma. Between 1924 and 1926 he spent long periods in the United States, translating English literature, giving lectures and teaching Italian at Harvard. As a liberal conservative and monarchist, he was initially not strictly opposed to the Italian Fascists. In 1927, however, already disillusioned, he wrote his verse-drama Icaro (published in 1930). In 1928 he won a silver medal in the art competitions of the Olympic Games for this work. Icaro is a lyrical drama composed in 1927 using an Italian meter of 11 syllables. It is dedicated to his brother, who also died in a plane crash. Here, Icarus is a poet sacrificing his life for freedom, which was denied by the tyrant Minos. The work, inspired by a sonnet on this theme by French 16th century poet Philippe Desportes, was translated into English by American actress and dramatist Ruth Draper, who was in a relationship with De Bosis. At the Olympics, the work submitted under the Latin motto (pseudonym) Paulo maiora canamus (English: let’s sing of something superior). This quote comes from the IVth Eclogue of the Roman poet Virgil. De Bosis continued to translate works by Americans, including John Erskine and Thornton Wilder, who later dedicated his novel The Ides of March to him. He became a member of a clandestine group trying to form a conservative alliance against Fascism. He was, however, reluctant to include leftist anti-Fascists. The opposition group was busted by the political police, during one of De Bosis’ stays in the United States. Subsequently, he lived in Switzerland, Paris (where he started to take flying lessons), and London, where he bought a plane. Taking off in Corsica, he planned to drop anti-Fascist leaflets over Roma. After an accident, however, the plan was revealed. Under an English pseudonym he bought another plane from Germany. In early October 1931, he took off near Marseille and dropped 400,000 manifestos over Roma. On his way back, followed by Italian military planes, he probably ran out of fuel and crashed. Neither the plane nor the body of the pilot were ever found. A comparison with the Greek figure Ikarus or the fate of Antoine de Saint-Exupéry is intriguing. His political testament Storia della mia morte, part of which was also printed on the leaflets, was eventually published in 1945.","Listed in Olympians Who Died in Aviation Crashes (In early October 1931, he took off near Marseille and on his way back, followed by Italian military planes, he probably ran out of fuel and crashed.

For Neumannová this was the culmination of a long career that took in 5 Winter Olympics and 8 World Championships over a 16 year period. She wasted little time in establishing herself as one of the world’s top skiers and scored her maiden World Cup victory in late 1992 whilst still a teenager. This was the first of 18 World Cup victories. Although she won a trio of silver medals and a bronze across the 1998 and 2002 Winter Games and a pair of World Championship bronze medals, it was not until 2005 that she won her first major title, the 10 km title at the World Championship at Oberstdorf. At the Torino Olympics she placed 2nd and 5th in her first two races before emerging victorious from a three woman sprint finish in the 30 km mass start event. She retained her world title in 2007 before retiring at the end of the season although she continued to make sporadic appearances in marathon races. Part of her summer training involved mountain biking and she became so good at this sport that she was chosen for the Czech national team and earned a bronze medal at the 1995 European championships. She was then chosen for the Atlanta Games where she became one of only four competitors who have combined mountain biking and cross country skiing at Olympic level. In 2009 she was elected vice-president of the athletes’ commission of the European Olympic Committees.","Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the World Nordic Ski Championships (2–1–2 1997 Trondheim CCS bronze: 15 km (competed for the Czech Republic); 1999 Ramsau CCS bronze: 5 km (competed for the Czech Republic); 2005 Oberstdorf CCS gold: 10 km (competed for the Czech Republic); 2007 Sapporo CCS gold: 10 km, silver: 7.5/7.5 km pursuit (competed for the Czech Republic))"

He was a friend of Pierre de Coubertin and introduced de Coubertin to Crown Prince Konstantine, who provided Royal support for the 1896 Athina Olympics. Merkati himself served as Secretary-General of the 1896 Organizing Committee. He was a founding member and President of the Athina Tennis Club and was a member of the Compiègne Club near Paris. In 1900 an Olympic golf tournament was held at the Compiègne Club and Merkati competed, finishing 11th among 12 entrants. Merkati was Court Chamberlain to several Kings of Greece, was Grand Marshall to the Royal Court of Greece, and was secretary to the Empress of Austria. When Sophokles Venizelos led the Greek socialist revolution, Merkati was at risk of persecution for his royal connections but escaped and lived in exile for 10 years on the isle of Zante, where he had been born. During his exile, the Greeks tried to appoint new IOC Members but de Coubertin fully supported Merkati and never allowed the new members. Merkati fully supported the 1906 Intercalated Olympics and informed the IOC that the Greeks had full intention of holding such Games every four years between scheduled Olympic Games, but the 1910 Intercalated Olympics, and subsequent ones, never occurred. Merkati was prominent in IOC Sessions and at the 1921 Lausanne Session he proposed that host cities should place the names of the winners of all events on inscribed plaques at the main Olympic Stadia. It was expected that Stockholm (1912) and Antwerpen (1920) would also do this, but Stockholm did not add the winners’ names until 1966 and Antwerpen never inscribed the names at the Beerschot Stadium. Merkati was definitely a Greek citizen in 1900 and always represented Hellas on the IOC from 1897-1925, but in 1900 he entered the Olympic golf competition out of the Compiègne Club in France.",Son-in-law of Abbie Pratt Listed in Olympian Members of the Nobility (Count) Listed in IOC Members of the Nobility (Count)

Lammens played hockey at St. Lawrence University, and then was drafted by the New York Islanders in the 1985 NHL Entry Draft. But he never played for the Islanders, spending most of his professional hockey career in the minor leagues, although he did play 27 games for the Ottawa Senators in the 1993-94 NHL season, scoring one goal and three points as a defenseman. Lammens played in the American Hockey League (AHL) for the Springfield Indians, Capital District Islanders, and the Prince Edward Island Senators, playing in that league from 1988-91 and 1993-94. He played with the Kansas City Blades in the International Hockey League (IHL) in the 1990-91 season. In 1990 he helped the Springfield Indians win the Calder Cup one day, and the next day won the New England Finn Regatta. Lammens was on the Canadian national team in 1992-93, captaining the team but he never competed at the Olympics in ice hockey. Throughout his hockey career Lammens competed in sailing, mainly in the Finn class. He won the 1990 and 1991 Finn Gold Cup, considered the World Championship of that class, but he struggled at the 1992 Olympics, despite taking that season off from ice hockey to train for the Olympics as a sailor. He placed 13th at Barcelona, which included a puzzling disqualification in one race when his life vest was not in the boat at inspection. Lammens also won a silver medal at the 1994 Finn Gold Cup. He was named Rolex Sailor of the Year by the Canadian Yachting Association from 1990-95. Lammens entered the business world after failing to make the 1996 Olympic team, joining Merrill Lynch, later Bank of American Merrill Lynch, in 1997. He was an investment trader with that group for seven years, until 2009, when he joined Thomas Weisel Partners in New York as a managing director of trading.

Nishi was born as the illegitimate son of Tokujiro Nishi, former Minister of Foreign Affairs, and succeeded to the title of Baron upon his father’s death in 1912. In order to pursue a diplomatic career, he attended military academy in Japan, graduating in 1924, and joined the Japanese cavalry. In 1927 he graduated from the Army Cavalry School and was promoted to the rank of Cavalry Lieutenant. In Italy, he bought his favored horse, Uranus, on a recommendation of his compatriot Yasushi Imamura. Before the 1932 Olympics, after competing in jumping events in Europe, Nishi spent time in Los Angeles where he became part of the Hollywood social circle, counting Douglas Fairbanks, Will Rogers, and Mary Pickford among his friends. His widow later noted that he sent her a letter stating, “I’m being very popular here. Bye-bye.” She also noted that he was despondent after the attack on Pearl Harbor, but felt he had to fight for Japan as he was first a soldier. After the Los Angeles Olympics, he became an instructor at the Army Cavalry School. He competed again in 1936 in Berlin, but with lesser success. When war broke out, he became responsible for the training of replenished horses until most of the cavalry regiments were converted into tank units. In 1944, Baron Nishi was named regimental commander of the 26th Tank Regiment, Mudanjiang, which was then assigned first to Northern Manchuria and subsequently to the defense of Iwo Jima. During a stop in Japan, he visited his horse Uranus for the last time in Baji Kōen, where 20 years later the dressage event of the Tokyo Olympics were held. Nishi died during the defense of Iwo Jima, but circumstances of his death are not precisely known and many stories have circulated. It has been written that American forces broadcast appeals to him daily, asking for his surrender, because of his fame in America. Some stories say he committed suicide, some say he was killed by machine-gun fire, and some say he was killed by American flamethrowers. He was posthumously promoted to the rank of colonel. His horse, Uranus, died one week later.",Listed in Olympians Who Committed Suicide (Possibly committed suicide during the Battle of Iwo Jima.)

In the early 1920s, he opened the office Andrews, Jones, Biscoe & Whitmore, of which Andrews was the main shareholder. He died in 1928, four years prior to the Los Angeles Olympics. The sports hall of Tufts College (now Tufts University), a private university near Boston, was opened in 1932 and named after John Albert Cousens, the president of the college. Andrews, Jones, Biscoe & Whitmore had worked out a plan for the complete campus. Most buildings, like the gymnasium, were characterized by a red brick façade with a white portico. Due to the economic situation, however, only a few of the planned buildings were realized. However, the draft was quoted again and again for extensions by later architects.",

Marie Greyhounds (1978-1980), and Brantford Alexanders (1980-1981). He only played one game with the team that year, however, spending the majority of the season with the American Hockey League’s Erie Blades. From 1982 through 1985 he split each year between the Penguins and the AHL’s Baltimore Slapjacks prior to skating exclusively with the Penguins from 1986 through 1987, at which point he was sent to the NHL’s Edmonton Oilers for the remainder of the 1987-1988 season. It was a great opportunity, as the Oilers took the Stanley Cup that year and Hannan brought home a championship ring when he returned to the Penguins for the 1988-1989 season. From 1989 through 1991 he skated for the NHL’s Toronto Maple Leafs, but took a leave in the middle of the 1991-1992 season to join Team Canada at the 1992 Winter Olympics. At the tournament he played in eight games, scored three goals, and took home a silver medal, which represented Canada’s first podium finish in Olympic hockey since 1968. By the time he returned from the Olympics a salary dispute with the Leafs had seen him traded to the league’s Buffalo Sabres, with whom he finished out the year and then continued with them until 1996. Another fortuitous trade had him sent to the Colorado Avalanche at the conclusion of the 1995-1996 season and he arrived in time to win his second Stanley Cup championship. He spent the next year with the Ottawa Senators before retiring and, as of 2009, works as a pharmaceutical supplier in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.",

He was selected to represent Chile in multiple events at the 1912 Stockholm Olympics but an injury prevented him from competing in most of them. Hammersley was able to start in the high jump and the standing high jump but failed to clear the minimum heights in each of the qualification rounds to advance further. Hammersley was listed to compete in the 100 metres, 200 metres, 4 × 100 metres relay, long jump, standing long jump, triple jump, and pentathlon, but was unable to start in any of them. At the first edition of the South American Championships in Athletics in 1918 Hammersley won gold in the discus throw and silver in the hammer. In between the two World Wars he served as a delegate for Chile at the 1928 Amsterdam Olympics and the 1936 Berlin Olympics.

He worked mainly in bronze and designed mostly horse and rider sculptures, but also some other figural sculptures. After his death, he was inducted into the Polo Hall of Fame. There were probably only the four bronze sculptures by polo players exhibited in Amsterdam. They all originated between 1910 and 1914 and were around 50 cm high and long. Models were befriended polo players from Rumsey’s Club, the Meadowbrook Polo Club on Long Island: Harrison Tweed (1885–1969), John Ruckman Fell, II (1890-1933), Francis “Skiddy” von Stade, Sr. (1884-1967), and Joseph Cornelius Rathborne (1883-1914). There is no further information on the reliefs in the art catalog. However, it is known that Rumsey designed decorative, colored cement friezes for the Isaac L. Rice Memorial Stadium in the early 1920s with the theme of the Olympic Games, although the stadium was demolished in 1989. In 1938, the artist’s widow donated the plaster casts to the University of Buffalo, where they were installed in the Clark Gymnasium. They were removed in 1993, but were restored and used as a model for producing bronze casts. The three bronze reliefs were then installed on the north campus of the University of Buffalo.

86215,Randy Gregg,Male,19 February 1956,193.0,91, Canada,CAN,"Randy Gregg’s career in youth hockey had been undistinguished but, upon entering the University of Alberta’s medical school in 1975, he decided to try out for the team and ended up making the cut. From 1975 through 1979 he played as a defenseman for the school, collecting two national championships and an award for best intercollegiate player. This was more than sufficient for him to be selected for Canada’s delegation to the 1980 Winter Olympics, where Canada won three games, lost two, and finished third in the pool behind Finland and the eventual silver medalists from the Soviet Union, which placed the Canadians sixth overall. Playing in the Olympics forced him to set aside his medical internship, as well as reject a handsome offer from the New York Rangers, but his loss in Lake Placid only increased his thirst for Olympic hockey. In order to remain eligible for the 1984 Games, he skated for two years with Japan’s Kokudo Keikado Tokyo, but eventually decided to return home and turn professional. He rejected higher offers from the Rangers and the Calgary Flames in order to play for his hometown Edmonton Oilers. With the exception of a brief stint with the Vancouver Canucks during the 1991-1992 season, he would remain with the Oilers for his entire career, winning Stanley Cups in 1984, 1985, 1987, 1988, and 1990. Gregg’s tenure with the Oilers, however, was never entirely stable. He retired briefly in 1986, but then returned, intending to have a more permanent retirement in 1987 as he prepared to complete his medical residency. An international career, however, once again beckoned. He had played for Team Canada at the 1984 Canada Cup, but in 1987 the International Olympic Committee announced that the 1988 ice hockey tournament would be open to professional players and Gregg was a perfect candidate, as he was not at the time affiliated with any National Hockey League team (the NHL refused to allow its current players the time off to compete at the Games). Unable to pass up an opportunity to represent his country at a home Olympics, he suited up for the national team, which ended up finishing fourth in the rankings. He then rejoined the Oilers and remained with them until what seemed like a final retirement in 1990. Although he did play for Vancouver in 1991-1992, Gregg returned to medicine permanently and took up a career as a family physician after his residency. He married Canadian Olympic speed skater Kathy Vogt, whom he met at the 1980 Olympics, and, as of 2014, two of their four children have represented Canada at the Games. Jamie and Jessica competed for Canada in short track speed skating and speed skating in 2010 and 2014, with the latter taking silver in the 3000 metre relay in 2010. Jamie, meanwhile, married Danielle Wotherspoon, who was a speed skater at the 2014 Games. In addition to his numerous hockey accolades, the Dr. Randy Gregg Award is given annually by Canadian Interuniversity Sport to an academically and athletically talented student athlete in ice hockey in his honor.","Husband of Kathy Vogt Father of Jamie Gregg Father of Jessica Gregg Father-in-law of Danielle Wotherspoon-Gregg Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the Winter Universiade (1–0–0 1981 Jaca IHO gold) Listed in Olympians With Animals Named After Them (Harpidella greggi, a trilobite)"

He first learned to skate at the age of 5 and took up speed skating at the age of 11, training at the Crystal rink in Calgary. Olin first started to take speed skating training seriously during World War II, in which he served with the Canadian Navy. Following his discharge in 1945, he co-founded the Calgary Speedskating Club in 1946, which first operated out of the Crystal rink, and then out of the athletic park in the Hillhurst area. After the latter was disbanded in 1949, Olin took to practicing his sport to train for the Olympics on the sloughs of a farm situated in the eastern outskirts of Calgary. Attending the Olympic trials held in Saskatoon in 1951, Olin finished first in the 1,500, 5,000 and 10,000 metre events and earned a spot on the Canadian speed skating delegation for the 1952 Helsinki Olympics, competing in four events. Olin would go on to represent Canada in speed skating at the next three Olympic games in 1956, 1960 and 1964, serving as the flag bearer for Canada at the Opening Ceremony at the latter. His personal best time of 43.1 in 500 metres was achieved in 1960, and he would accomplish three personal bests in his final Olympic appearance in 1,500 metres (2:13.5), 5,000 metres (8:04.6) and 10000 metres (16:53.3). The winner of multiple national and provincial championship titles, he also held Canadian records in 1500 metres (2:13.5) and 10,000 metres (17:35) and was involved in coaching and management of his sport, developing the Olin Time Award system as a means of training. Olin retired from competitive speed skating in 1966. Outside of sports, Olin was a member of the Calgary Police Service from 1946 to 1956, serving many years as a motorcycle policeman. He briefly pursued business ventures in Hinton, Alberta in the late 1950s before returning to law enforcement as probation officer with the Alberta Attorney General’s office, first in Edmonton and then later back in his hometown of Calgary. After his retirement from sports, he moved to Vancouver Island where he enjoyed breeding Airedale dogs and proudly displayed his Olympic memorabilia in his living room, including the flag which he carried at the 1964 Olympics. He was inducted into the Canadian Speed Skating Hall of Fame in 1980. Olin and his wife Ruth had two sons; the eldest, Craig, was tragically killed in a drowning accident at the age of 21 in 1977.

He developed his own style of the Dutch version of Art Deco and gave it more of an English than a French or German view, which was referred to the art direction De Stijl. He was trained in a stonemason company and at an evening school for artisans in Amsterdam. He then worked as a designer for several pottery manufacturers and for a company for home furnishings. As a sculptor he mostly created animal figures in matte white pottery. Van der Hoef also designed functional objects like tableware and gave the scenery and sets a number. From 1912, as a medalist he created several medals in a two-dimensional way approached to three-dimensional sculptures. From 1923 onwards he designed objects for everyday use made of metal and ceramics. In addition, he also created numerous small sculptures. He was a member of numerous artist associations. His brother was the graphic artist and painter Gerrit van der Hoef (1879 1954). Van der Hoef earned a silver medal for his entry of an Olympic medal draft in the Art Competitions in the category Sculpturing, Medals and Reliefs. Of the seven medals submitted, two are shown in the catalog. The medal awarded with the silver medal is originally a design for the winner’s medal. It shows the Olympic fire on the marathon tower on the front and a stylized palm branch between ornaments on the back. The bronze cast medal has a diameter of 83 mm. The second medal was created on the occasion of the First Air Mail Flight to the Dutch East Indies in 1927. The medal with a flying dove above the clouds is a bronze casting with a diameter of 116 mm. He also participated with three medals at the Arts Competitions in 1932 in Los Angeles.

His best performance in St. Louis came in the shot put when, after trailing Wesley Coe, he came back to take the Olympic title with a new world record of 48-7 (14.81). Rose lost his world record to the Irishman, Denis Horgan, later in the season, and Coe made a further improvement in 1905, but Rose recaptured the record in 1907 and beat both Horgan and Coe at the 1908 Olympics. By 1909, Rose’s weight had risen to a then massive 286 lbs. (130 kg.) and, in winning his third straight AAU title, he became the first man to break the 50-foot barrier. One week later Rose established the first official IAAF record, but his greatest day had come earlier in the season in his hometown of Healdsburg, California, when he won the shot put at 54-4 (16.56) and threw the hammer 178-5 (54.38). Both marks bettered existing world records, but they were never ratified because they were made in an unsanctioned meet, and there was some question about their measurement. The shot put mark would not be bettered, however, until 1934. Apart from his four AAU shot titles, Rose won the discus twice and was the inaugural AAU javelin champion in 1909. Rose attended the University of Michigan and later studied law at Chicago. He was the flag-bearer in 1908 who refused to dip the flag as he walked past the English king, leading to the tradition which survives to this day. He died of typhoid fever in 1913, aged only 28.

A year later he was on the stakeout team in Chicago that apprehended Doc Barker, one of the most wanted criminals in the United States. Acting on a tip that same year, he also discovered the body of Chicago gangster Baby Face Nelson. Two years later he was involved in a shoot-out in Bangor, Maine with Al Brady, who was at the time Public Enemy #1 and who was killed during the shoot-out. In World War II he joined the Marine Corps and rose to the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel. He was commander of the Marine Corps’ marksmanship unit for several years and competed in the 1948 Olympics while in the Marines. When the FBI celebrated its 100th anniversary in 2007, Walsh was still around, by then 100-years-old, noting that he was older than the FBI.

As a child, he was told he would never be able to take part in any physical exercise because it was believed his father had passed on a congenital heart condition to his son. That was only until another doctor said that exercise was the best thing for Jim’s health, and he then enjoyed playing football before discovering boxing, gymnastics, wrestling, and then weightlifting. At the age of 15 he was a natural lifter and three years later was the Lancashire lightweight champion. Halliday joined the Army at the outbreak of World War II, and was involved in the evacuation of Dunkirk before being posted to the Far East, where he became a Japanese prisoner-of-war and was forced to work on the Japanese Death Railway. When he was released in 1946 Halliday weighed just 6st (38kg) and that is when he overcame adversity for a second time. He soon put his weight back on and returned to weightlifting. Just two years after leaving the POW camp, Halliday was captain of the British weightlifting team at the 1948 London Olympics where he won a lightweight bronze medal. He further delighted the crowd with his routine of jumping over the bar after completing his lift, which earned him the nickname “Jumping Jim”. Also in 1948, Jim won a gold medal at the European Championships in London. He also won the lightweight gold medal at the 1954 British Empire Games and middleweight title four years later.

His return at the 1912 Olympics ended very differently. Still a complete unknown, Prokopp claimed the title amidst the American and Swedish favorites. 18-year-old Swedish schoolboy Nils Romander, who had the lead with one shot to go, became too nervous and missed his final shot, leaving Prokopp, one of six shooters to hit 50 out of 50 in the second stage, with the title. Prokopp, who would never win a World Championship medal, would return to the Olympics again in 1924 (Hungary was barred from the 1920 Games), but these Games were as unmemorable as the 1908 ones.

A clever left-winger he also turned out for the Northern Nomads when required and was a member of the final 18-man squad for the 1908 London Olympics but did not play. However, he did play for England amateurs four times between 1907 and 1913, scoring just one goal, which came in his final match against Ireland. Just before the Olympics he moved to Everton on 11 September 1908 scoring on his début in the 3-2 win over Middlesbrough a week later as Everton went on to finish runners-up in the first division in Barlow’s inaugural season with them. He played just six League games in 1909-10 but played in all Everton’s seven games in the FA Cup that saw them lose in a replay to Barnsley in the semi-final. Barlow spent two and a half seasons at Goodison, scoring five goals in 34 games before returning to Preston in the 1910-11 season. In 94 League and Cup games for North End he scored eight goals. Barlow was selected for the Amateurs against the Professionals in the 1912-13 FA Charity Shield at The Den, Millwall. He remained an amateur throughout his career and worked as an electrical engineer. George Barlow died suddenly in March 1921 on the day he was burying his younger brother Thomas. Their mother Helen had been buried just eight days earlier.",

Joe Benner competed in two other Olympics, though not with the success he had in 1952. At the 1948 Olympics, he finished fourth in the free pistol event, despite having had troubles with his equipment in training. A week before the Olympics he was loaned a pistol by the manager of the U.S. team, Karl Frederick, and Benner used it in the Olympics. Though Benner was an Olympic neophyte in 1948, the gun was a veteran, having been used by Frederick in 1920 to win a gold medal.","Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the Summer Pan American Games (6–1–0 1951 Buenos Aires SHO gold: 25 m rapid-fire pistol, silver: 50 m free pistol; 1955 Ciudad de México SHO gold: 50 m free pistol, 25 m centre fire pistol, 50 m free pistol team, and 25 m rapid-fire pistol team, 25 m centre fire pistol team) Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the World Shooting Championships (6–5–6 1949 Buenos Aires gold: 25 m rapid-fire pistol and 25 m center fire pistol team, bronze: 25 m center fire pistol, 50 m free pistol team, and 25 m rapid-fire pistol team; 1952 Oslo gold: 25 m rapid-fire pistol, 25 m rapid-fire pistol team, and 25 m center fire pistol team, bronze: 25 m center fire pistol and 50 m free pistol; 1954 Caracas gold: 50 m free pistol, silver: 25 m center fire pistol, 25 m center fire pistol team, 50 m free pistol team, and 25 m rapid-fire pistol team; 1958 Moskva silver: 25 m rapid-fire pistol team, bronze: 25 m center fire pistol team)"

With Tonya Harding and Nancy Kerrigan very much in the spotlight, the World Champion was nearly forgotten. However, in a very close contest, she edged out Kerrigan, winning Ukraine’s first ever Olympic gold medal.

51468,Greg Louganis,Male,29 January 1960,175.0,73, United States,USA,"American Greg Louganis is considered the greatest diver of all time. After winning Olympic silver in the platform in 1976 as a 16-year-old, he missed the 1980 Games because of the United States’ boycott but returned to take the springboard-platform double in both 1984 and 1988. His 1988 springboard victory was the stuff of high drama, when he qualified despite striking the board with his head on the next-to-last qualifying dive. Louganis also won both titles at the World Championships of 1982 and 1986, having earlier won the platform in 1978. It is highly probably that the 1980 boycott prevented Louganis from winning the diving double at three consecutive Olympics, an unprecedented feat. He won both springboard and platform at the 1979 Pan-American Games and repeated that feat at the 1982 and 1986 World Championships. He won over 30 national championships, more than any other American, and numerous international titles, but it is the manner in which he won that stunned the fans and impressed the judges. At the 1982 Worlds, performing an inward 2½ pike, he became the first diver in international competition to be awarded a perfect 10 from all seven judges. Later in that competition, his front 3½ pike received the highest score ever awarded a single dive with 92.07 points. He performed these feats by combining great athletic ability with unusual grace honed by many years of classical dance training. Of Samoan and European descent, he studied classical dance for many years and this training provided the basis for the elegance and artistry of his performances. His superiority over his contemporaries was considerable and he held many records for the highest marks ever achieved in competition. Sadly, in the early 1990s, Louganis announced that he was HIV-positive, and had actually been so at the time of the 1988 Olympics when he struck his head on the springboard. He now is known as a breeder of Parson Russell Terriers, especially those used in agility training.","Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the Summer Pan American Games (6–0–0 1979 San Juan DIV gold: 3 m springboard and platform; 1983 Caracas DIV gold: 3 m springboard and platform; 1987 Indianapolis DIV gold: 3 m springboard and platform) Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the Summer Universiade (2–0–0 1983 Edmonton DIV gold: 3 m springboard and platform) Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the World Aquatics Championships (5–0–0 1978 West Berlin DIV gold: platform; 1982 Guayaquil DIV gold: 3 m springboard and platform; 1986 Madrid DIV gold: 3 m springboard and platform) Listed in Olympic Divers - Individual Double Champions, Different Years (1984-88 Springboard and Platform.)

White Bear’s tribal name was Esakakasha Manakis, which meant Crazy Dragon Fly. White Bear was born in Montana to a father who was a member of the US Army cavalry. At age 14, after displaying significant intelligence early in school, he was accepted into the Carlisle Indian School in Pennsylvania, where he starred in football. At age 17, in 1903, White Bear enlisted in the US Navy, probably falsifying his age. He hoped to visit foreign lands to better himself as a teacher and wished to return to the Crow Reservation and open a school for Native American children. White Bear died near Hardin, Montana after he went missing in April 1941. His body was found 35 miles southwest of Hardin near Soap Creek in early June. The sheriff investigating the case surmised that he died of exposure from a snowstorm the night before Easter, and the inquest established the probable date of death as 30 April.

At München, the favorites for 400 freestyle gold were Cooper and young American Rick DeMont, after the world record holder Kurt Krumpholz did not make the American Olympic team. In the Olympic final, Cooper and DeMont swam the last 50 m shoulder by shoulder and it was unclear who had won the race, but the electric timers gave it to DeMont by 1/100th of a second – 4:00.26 to 4:00.27. Two days after the news broke that DeMont had tested positive for a banned substance and was disqualified from the 400 freestyle. DeMont was an asthmatic and did not deny that he had taken Marax, an ephedrine derivative, the night before his 400 free final. DeMont never hid the fact that he took the drug on a regular basis for his asthma, and had noted this on his medical form required of US athletes, but the United States’ team doctors had never checked to see if it contained any banned substances and never notified the IOC. The IOC initially left the gold medal vacant, until a protest from the Australian delegation resulted in Cooper being awarded the gold medal, but after hearing the final decision Cooper said, “I don’t want the medal.” Born in Singapore, Cooper’s family moved to Rockhampton, Queensland when he was five. He was equally strong at freestyle and backstroke, but had a brief swimming career, and was only on the Australian national team from 1970-74. Besides his Olympic gold, Cooper won 400 free and 4x200 free relay silvers and a 1,500 bronze at the 1973 World Championships, and 200 backstroke gold, 400 freestyle silver, and 100 backstroke bronze at the 1974 Commonwealth Games. He won multiple Australian titles – 200 free in 1973; 400 free in 1972-74; 800 free in 1973; 1,500 in 1972; 100 back in 1971-73, and 200 back in 1971-74. He also set two world records during his career – 4:01.7 in 400 m at the 1972 Australian Nationals and Olympic Trials and 8:23.8 in 800 m freestyle at the 1972 New South Wales State championships.

He joined the local Fethard Blues Gaelic football team and soon became their captain. While in Ireland he competed in several all-around championships, while specializing in the pole vault. He won two Gaelic Athletic Association All-Ireland pole vault titles, at Tipperary in 1897 and Corkstown, Co. Cork in 1899. He competed in the Irish all-around championship in 1898, but did not finish. He also set the Irish hop-step-and-jump record with 47-5 (14.45) in 1899. Holloway’s brother Jim also won GAA titles in the standing jumps. In 1904 Jack Holloway emigrated to the United States and joined the Greater New York Irish-American Athletic Association (GNYIAAA). Although an Irish national (and hence formally British at the time), he is considered a US athlete in 1904 because of that affiliation. He came fourth in the all-around competition at the St. Louis Olympics, which was won by fellow Irishman Tom Kiely. After the Olympics, Holloway settled near St. Louis, got a job in the life insurance business and joined the Missouri AC. He lived the rest of his life in the midwestern United States. Holloway joined the US Army in 1918 and served with the Army and Athletic Welfare Service. He left the Army in 1920 and opened a night school for ex-servicemen in Topeka, Kansas. He was director of the school for five years before returning to the life insurance business. A granddaughter of Holloway’s, Kitty Sullivan, was a well-known Irish actress and was the second wife of the distinguished Irish actor Milo O’Shea.",

In 1994, when Armenia had become an independent nation, he joined with Joe Almasian, a friend of his from Providence, Rhode Island, to form a bobsled team for Armenia at the Lillehammer Olympics. They were inspired to do so by an older friend, Paul Varadian, a former competitive sledder who knew them through the Providence Chapter of the Armenian Youth Federation (AYF). In late 1992, Topalian and Almasian began driving to the Olympic Training Centre in Lake Placid (a 6-hour trip) every Friday and spent the weekends there learning to bobsled, trained by former US Olympian Jim Hickey.

He also came close to the podium at the 1988 Summer Olympics, where he finished fourth in the C1-1000, and the 1993 World Championships, where he had the same placement in the C2-1000 with David Frost. Frost and Cain would go on to compete at the 1992 Summer Olympics, where they placed seventh and ninth in the C2-1000 and C1-500 respectively.

Four years later, in Seoul, there was another gold medal (K2 500 m), plus a silver (K2 1000 m). At the Flatwater World Championships he won five medals: gold 1985 K2 500 m and 1987 K2 1000 m, silver 1983 K1 500 m, 1987 K2 500 m, and 1990 K2 10000 m.
