64916,Alfred König,Male,2 October 1913,,, Austria,AUT,"Alfred König was the son of a Jewish merchant who spent many years in the Turkish city of Istanbul – a fact that had major repercussions for him, both good and bad, throughout his athletic career. It is believed he was born in Wien (Vienna), but he certainly spent periods of his childhood in Turkey. Insecurity amongst the Jewish population in Istanbul caused the family to move back to Austria in the late 1920s, ironically just as anti-Semitism was on the rise in Europe. A runner who competed at distances from 100m to 400m, König began to compete for the Hakoah club of Wien around 1930 and by 1932 was Austrian junior champion over 400m. With the rise of fascism in Austria new citizenship laws were enacted which affected the eligibility of Austrian athletes to compete in championships, set national records and represent Austria in international competition. König lost his junior titles retrospectively because of doubts over his citizenship and he reverted to being a Turkish national. Ironically 1935 turned out to be his best year in Austrian colours when, representing the Jewish community in Austria at the Maccabiah Games, he won the 200 m, was part of the winning 4 x 400 m relay and won two other medals. In the Olympic year of 1936 citizenship issues with Austria seemed to have been solved as he won the national 400 metre title and earned a spot on the Olympic team. He made little impression in Berlin, finished last in his 200 m heat and next to last in his appearance at 400 m at an event where his appearance cost him his membership of the Hakoah club. A recurrence of doubts over his citizenship ruined his season in 1937 but by the start of the summer of 1938 he had much more important things to worry about following the “Anschluss”, the invasion of Austria by Nazi Germany, and the subsequent removal of many of the rights of Jewish Austrians. He once again returned to Turkey and resumed his athletic career under the name Ali Ferit Gören. In his first season in Turkish colours he broke the national record to win the 1938 Balkan Games 400 m title then defended the gold medal in 1939. He also took a bronze medal at 200 m. König/Gören continued to compete sporadically until 1944 and afterwards coached local athletes well into the 1970s. He was Austrian champion in 400 metres (1936), 4×100 relay (1937), and 4×400 relay (1934 and 1937), Maccabiah Games 200 metres and 4x400 relay gold medallist, 400 metres silver medallist and 4x100 relay bronze winner for Austria in 1935.

In the meantime she had won silver at the 2001 World Cup in the relay event and improved her standings at the 2002 Winter Olympics. From 2005-2006 she took two more bronze medals at World Cup events, as well as one silver, but her most memorable story came from the 2006 Winter Olympics. In the Team Sprint event she won silver after Norwegian coach Bjørnar Håkensmoen gave her a ski pole to replace one that had been accidentally broken by one of the other competitors. Norway’s team ended up fourth in the event, ostensibly losing their chance at a medal because of this act of sportsmanship, and both Håkensmoen, the Norwegian embassy, and the Norwegian Olympic Committee were showered with gifts from Canadians to show their gratitude. Interested in sport causes, Renner posed nude for a “Nordic Nudes” calendar to help raise money for the Canadian Women’s Nordic Ski Team in 2001.

95937,Matti Nykänen,Male,17 July 1963,177.0,54, Finland,FIN,"Matti Nykänen is the winner of a record four Olympic gold medals for ski jumping, and is still considered one of the greatest ski jumpers ever. At the 1984 Winter Olympics Nykänen won the large hill competition and placed second on the normal hill behind Jens Weißflog, before winning both events in 1988, when he also won a third gold medal in the newly introduced team event. He was also the World Champion on the large hill in 1982 and won four World Championship golds in a row in the team event in 1984, 1985, 1987 and 1989. He also won a silver in 1985 on the normal hill, bronzes on the large hill in 1985 and 1989 and in the team event in 1982 at the World Championships. Nykänen also competed at the World Ski Flying Championships, winning a gold in 1985, silver in 1990, and bronzes in 1983, 1986 and 1988. In all, he won a total of 46 World Cup competitions (more than any other ski jumper through 2009) and he won the overall World Cup title four times between 1983 and 1988. Nykänen also won the Four Hills tournament twice (1982-83 and 1987-88) and won the jumping competition at the Holmenkollen Ski Festival in 1982 and 1987. In 1987 Nykänen was awarded the Holmenkollen Medal (shared with Hermann Weinbuch). Nykänen won 13 Finnish titles in ski jumping and was selected as the Finnish Athlete of the Year in 1985 and 1988. A controversial and often ill-tempered individual, Nykänen earned considerable respect for his sporting talents but little for his general behavior. In 1991, after his retirement from sports, Nykänen launched a career as a pop singer. His first album Yllätysten yö (The Night of Surprises) was published in 1992 and sold over 25,000 copies. Nykänen became the second Olympic gold medalist after Tapio Rautavaara to sell a golden record in Finland. His next album Samurai (1993), though, was not very successful, mainly because of his heavy use of alcohol, stories of domestic violence as both the perpetrator and victim and multiple engagements, marriages and divorces. In 1996 Nykänen legally changed his name to Paanala, which was his then-current wife’s surname, but he changed it back in 1998 after a divorce. In 1996 Nykänen tried his hand in politics for a short while, when he was elected to the Uuranen City Council. But at the end of 1990s Nykänen had severe financial difficulty and was even forced to work as a stripper in a casino, before he met sausage millionairess Mervi Tapola in 1999, who he married in 2001. In 2002 Nykänen made a comeback as a singer and released the single Elämä on laiffii (Life is Cool), and a Matti Nykänen cider brand with the same advertisement slogan was produced. But the stories of his domestic violence remained and in 2001 Nykänen was accused of assaulting Tapola. The charges were later withdrawn when Tapola refused to testify, although a restraining order was imposed upon Nykänen. On 24 August 2004, Nykänen was arrested on suspicion of attempted manslaughter by the stabbing of a family friend after he had lost a finger pulling competition. He was found guilty of aggravated assault and sentenced to a 26-month jail term in October 2004, but since it was his first offense, he was released from jail in September 2005. While on probation, he was re-arrested four days later for again abusing Tapola. Nykänen was convicted again for four months on 16 March 2006, but soon after his release he stabbed a man in a pizza restaurant in Korpilahti. This time he was sentenced to two years in prison, but the term was later shortened to 60 days and 57 hours of community service. In 2006 Nykänen produced his third album Ehkä otin, ehkä en (Maybe I Took, Maybe Not). After his last prison sentence it seemed that Nykänen had made some effort to stay out of trouble, as he started ski jumping again, winning the 2008 World Senior Championships, and he started his own cooking show on Finnish television in 2009. But on Christmas Day 2009 Nykänen was arrested again, under suspicion of injuring his wife Tapola with a knife and trying to throttle her with a bathrobe belt, only to be released three days later when his wife dropped the charges. It was later revealed that the couple had filed a divorce request on 14 separate occasions during the summer of 2009, but they were always withdrawn a few days later. The saga of Matti Nykänen, possibly the greatest ever ski jumper, ended with his death in 2019.","Listed in Olympians Who Were Awarded the Holmenkollmedaljen (1987) Listed in Olympians Who Were on the Podium at the Four Hills Tournament (1981/82 Oberstdorf winner; 1982/83 Total winner, Oberstdorf second, Innsbruck winner; 1983/84 Total third, Innsbruck second; 1984/85 Total second, Oberstdorf second, Innsbruck winner; 1987/88 Total winner, Oberstdorf second, Garmisch-Partenkirchen winner, Innsbruck winner, Bischofshofen winner; 1988/89 Total second, Oberstdorf third, Garmisch-Partenkirchen winner) Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the World Nordic Ski Championships (6–2–3 1982 Oslo SJP gold: large hill, bronze: team; 1984 Sarajevo (Olympics) SJP gold: large hill, silver: normal hill; 1984 Engelberg SJP gold: team; 1985 Seefeld SJP gold: team, bronze: large hill; 1987 Oberstdorf SJP gold: team, silver: normal hill; 1989 Lahti SJP gold: team, bronze: large hill) Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the World Ski Flying Championships (1–1–3 1983 Harrachov bronze: individual; 1985 Planica gold: individual; 1986 Kulm bronze: individual; 1988 Oberstdorf bronze: individual; 1990 Vikersund silver: individual) Listed in Olympians Who Were Sent to Prison (He was found guilty of aggravated assault and sentenced to a 26-month jail term in October 2004, but since it was his first offense, he was released from jail in September 2005.

A few months later the siblings again finished second but this time on the larger stage at the Los Angeles Olympics – it was Ernest’s second consecutive Olympic tandem silver medal.

890886,Bascom Johnson,Male,17 January 1878,,, United States,USA,"Bascom Johnson competed at the 1900 Paris Olympics in a special pole vault competition. The 1900 pole vault was scheduled for Sunday afternoon. The Americans claimed that the French told them that any field event final that was contested on Sunday would not be considered finished until the Americans had a chance to better the marks posted the next day. However, on Saturday night, the French ruled that the results of all Sunday events would be final, with no recourse to any athletes who did not compete due to Sabbatarian objections. Apparently, the Americans were not told of this decision. The top American vaulters were Johnson, Charles Dvorak, and Daniel Horton. They were not at the field on Sunday when the pole vault started, which was won by American [Irv Baxter], with second going to another American, Meredith Colket. On Monday, the French authorities held a special pole vault event to assuage the angry American officials. Bascom Johnson won this event by clearing 3.38 metres, but it had no bearing on the Olympic championship. Johnson graduated from Yale University in 1900. He won the pole vault at the IC4A Championship in 1897 and 1900, and was third at that meet in 1898 and second in 1899. Johnson also won the pole vault at the Harvard-Yale dual meet in 1897, 1898, and 1900. He then obtained a law degree from the University of Pennsylvania. Johnson later became a law officer with the Federal Indian Bureau. He became secretary of the Recreation Committee of New York City, and then worked with the American Social Hygiene Association. In that role he made efforts to eradicate prostitution in the American west, particularly the Barbary Coast of San Francisco. During World War I Johnson worked with the US military to combat venereal disease in soldiers. From 1924-27 he was the head of League of Nations investigations into international sex slavery trafficking.",

Oddvar Brå competed in all five winter Olympics between 1972 and 1988, but failed to win an individual Olympic medal, although he won two silver medals as a member of the Norwegian relay team in 1972 and 1980. An excellent junior skier, he and friend Ivar Formo won several European Junior Champion titles in 1968 and 1970.

In a dramatic duel with Soviet’s Aleksandr Zavyalov on the last leg of the relay two days later, he broke his pole, yet Norway and Soviet were judged as equal after a very close finish and shared the gold medal. A popular Norwegian expression “Hvor var du da Oddvar Brå brakk staven?” (“Where were you when Oddvar Brå broke his pole?”) emerged from may be the most dramatic moment in Norwegian TV-sport history. Brå had five victories at Holmenkollen, and was the overall winner of the cross-country skiing World Cup in 1975 and 1979.

From 1919-24, he studied painting and graphic arts at the Art Academy in Kassel and graduated with the state examination as a drawing teacher. The following year he made a study trip to Paris. From 1928-33, Bode worked in Berlin as a painter and teacher at the Städtisches Werklehrer-Seminar (Municipal Seminar for Manual Training). Bode had to leave the city, however, when he was banned from working by the Nazis because of his membership in the social democratic SPD and was considered “degenerate” after 1936. After returning to his hometown Kassel, where he worked in his brother Paul’s (1903-1978) architectural firm, he was called up for military service again and assigned to building soldiers’ quarters. After World War II, he became chairman of the Hessian Secession and re-founder of the Kassel Academy. Bode launched the first documenta exhibition in 1955 parallel to the Federal Garden Show. The exhibition was a great success showing a broad overview of 20th century art. He managed the exhibition three more times until documenta 4. With documenta, he created one of the most important cultural institutions in the world, which continues without interruption to this day. In 1974, after receiving numerous awards for services to contemporary art, he received the Federal Cross of Merit. In addition, Bode painted, drew and worked as an art teacher. Almost his complete early artistic work burned in his apartment in 1944 during a bombing raid. While helping to popularize abstract art with the documenta, Bode himself painted in the style of lyrical realism. His main subject in painting and graphic art was the landscape. Especially in the 1950s, he also designed furniture and exhibition stands. On his 100th birthday in 2000, he was honored with a postage stamp. Bode’s daughter Renée Nele (*1932) became a well-known sculptor. Bode’s painting Divers, exhibited in 1952, bears the comment “Lacquer Paint, 1951” in the Official Report.",

She built up physical strength by working on her family farm and first represented Switzerland at the World Cup in 1978, finishing sixth in the slalom. Her World Championship debut came a few weeks later, and she placed ninth in the giant slalom. It was not until December 1979 that she earned her first podium finishes, earning third and second in back-to-back giant slalom events, which, along with third place in the slalom in January 1980, was sufficient to send her to the 1980 Winter Olympics. At the Games she failed to complete the giant slalom, but finished fifth in both runs of the slalom, which was sufficient to earn her a bronze medal. Hess achieved her first World Cup victory in January 1981 and from there her star truly began to rise. Over the next year she won 11 additional World Cup events and then dominated the 1982 World Championships by winning the slalom, giant slalom, and combined. This feat earned her the title of Swiss Sportswoman of the Year. On her way to the 1984 Winter Olympics she earned another 11 World Cup victories but faltered at the Games, coming in fifth in the slalom and seventh in the giant slalom. She did, however, serve as the national flagbearer during the opening ceremony. She took the combined title at the 1985 World Championships, but only won one World Cup event in the interim. She rebounded and captured seven events between the 1985 and 1987 World Championships, but her victories in the combined and the slalom at the latter tournament would prove to be her last. She retired in March 1987, having earned a total of 88 World Cup podium finishes, five World Cup slalom titles (1981-1983, 1985-1986), one World Cup combined title (1984), and two overall titles (1982 and 1984).

Born in Torino, and under the coach Usmiani, he was a serious and quiet boy: very strong in individual events and a stalwart on the first leg of relays. Rora débuted with the National team in 1961 and one year later won all the Italian titles in backstroke, all in Italian record time, and he was a substitute at the 1962 European Championships in Leipzig.

In 1965 he won eight Italian titles (individual and relays) and helped the National team to an historical victory in the Six Nations event in Roma defeating Great Britain, Sweden, Netherlands, West Germany and France. Rora earned 15 caps with the National team from 1961-65. He won eight Italian titles in the 100 backstroke and seven in the 200 back.

79125,Jim Thorpe,Male,28 May 1887,183.0,86, United States,USA,"He was born “Wa-tho-huck”, a Sauk and Fox name meaning “Bright Path”, though his Christening certificate listed him as Jacobus Franciscus Thorpe. But he is known to the modern world simply as Jim Thorpe – possibly the greatest athlete of all time. He was born on an Indian reservation in Oklahoma, near the town of Bellemont to Hiram P. Thorp, the son of Hiram G. Thorp, a trapper, and No-ten-o-quah, a member of the Thunder Clan of Chief Black Hawk of the Sauk and Fox Tribe. His mother was Charlotte Vieux, who had been brought up as a Potawatomi Indian, but she was the daughter of a Frenchman, and an Indian woman, Elizabeth Goslin, who had both Potawatomi and Kickapoo blood. Jim Thorpe was one of 11 children, and had a twin brother, who died when he was only eight. In 1898, at age 11, Jim Thorpe was sent to the Haskell Institute in Lawrence, Kansas, one of the two Indian schools that had been set up by the U.S. Government and Military, where he remained until 1904. In June 1904, Jim Thorpe entered the second Indian school, Carlisle Indian School in Carlisle, Pennsylvania. There he became a legend as both a football player and track & field athlete. Thorpe’s football career at Carlisle has been well documented. He is considered the greatest American football player pre-World War I. He primarily played running back, but apparently could do everything on the football field. Less has been written of his track & field career. Thorpe was undefeated in the decathlon – he competed in only one, that being the 1912 Olympic decathlon. The first decathlons in the United States were the 1912 Olympic Trials, but Thorpe did not compete. There were only two entrants in the decathlon Eastern Olympic Trials, so Thorpe was added to the team based on the strength of his performance in the pentathlon trial the week previously. On 18 May, Thorpe had taken part in the pentathlon Olympic Trials. He won three of the five events and finished second in the other two to win the trials with a score of 7 pts. In Stockholm he first won the pentathlon on 7 July, winning four of the five events and taking third in the javelin to win easily with only seven points. The next day he competed in the Olympic high jump, finishing equal fourth, and four days later, he took seventh in the long jump. On 13 July, he started the decathlon, in that year a three-day affair. His performance there is well-known as he set a world record which would have stood until 1926, had it not been struck from the books. The King of Sweden gave him his gold medals and told him, “You, sir, are the greatest athlete in the world.” He returned to America and a hero’s welcome. On 2 September he competed in the AAU All-Around Championship, the early American forerunner of the decathlon, which he won, breaking Martin Sheridan’s world record in the process. He scored 7,476 points and won by over 3,000 points. His track & field career was over. Jim Thorpe also played professional baseball. It has been written that he was a poor excuse for a major league player, but this is probably unwarranted denigration. He was no star, but he was an adequate major leaguer. In his final major league year, 1919, he batted .327 for 62 games. His career major league average was .252. But most of his early baseball career was spent in the minor leagues. He played for the Rocky Mount Railroaders in 1909-1910, pitching and playing the outfield. After the 1912 Olympics, he was signed by the New York Giants and began a 7-year major league career, playing 6 seasons with the Giants, some time with the Cincinnati Reds, and finishing one year with the Boston Braves in 1919. In 1920-22 he extended his career, playing Triple A ball in the three major Triple A leagues, with the Akron Buckeyes (International League), the Toledo Mud Hens (American Association), and the Portland Beavers (Pacific Coast League). Jim Thorpe later played professional football, but by then he was definitely in the twilight of his athletic brilliance. When Thorpe starred for Carlisle on the gridiron, there was no true professional football league, although there were scattered barnstorming teams. While still playing major league baseball, Thorpe signed with one of them in 1915, the Canton Bulldogs. He was paid the then astronomical sum of $250.00 (US) per game. He played for the Bulldogs from 1915 through 1919 while they were still an independent team. By then he was 32 years old, but still the most feared runner in the game. On 20 August 1920, the National Football League (NFL) was established among four barnstorming professional teams from Ohio – Akron, Canton, Cleveland, and Dayton. Because of his name and prominence, Thorpe was appointed as the first president of the National Football League. Thorpe continued to play as well, since he was the biggest drawing card in the nascent league. Jim Thorpe played in the NFL from 1920-26 and again in 1928. How good was he as a football player? As did many other magazines, Football Digest produced an end of century special in June 1999, listing the Top 100 football players of all time. Thorpe was ranked 17th. When his athletic career ended, Thorpe turned to Hollywood. He worked as an extra and stuntman in numerous movies, but never earned much money from his acting career. He later turned to drinking heavily, and he would eventually die, while living only in a trailer, far from auspicious surroundings for the one-time greatest athlete in the world. In early 1913, it was revealed that Thorpe had played minor league baseball in the United States, as described above. For this he was retroactively declared a professional by the AAU (Amateur Athletic Union) and the IOC and his records at the 1912 Olympics were declared void. He had to return his gold medals, and his Challenge Trophies. What is not so well known is that Thorpe should never have been disqualified in the first place. Over the years numerous attempts were made to get the IOC to reverse the decision, mostly started by Thorpe’s children. Some efforts succeeded gradually. In 1973, the AAU restored Thorpe’s amateur status for the years 1909-1912. This was followed in 1975 by the United States Olympic Committee making a similar restoration. In 1982, the Thorpe family, aided by Bob Wheeler, one of Thorpe’s biographers, and his wife, Florence Ridlon, succeeded in their long struggle to have Jim Thorpe’s medals restored by the International Olympic Committee. It was revealed in Sports Illustrated that a key factor in this decision was a discovery by Ridlon, who found a pamphlet in the Library of Congress which gave the rules and regulations for the 1912 Olympic Games. It stated that the statute of limitations for a claim against any Olympic athlete’s eligibility in 1912 had to have been made within 30 days after the awarding of the prizes. The announcement of Thorpe’s professional baseball career occurred in January 1913. Thus it was almost six months after the end of the Olympics and his disqualification was completely unwarranted. On 27 February 1982, Wheeler and Ridlon founded The Jim Thorpe Foundation, expressly for the purpose of moving to have his medals and honors restored. On 13 October 1982, only eight months after the formation of The Jim Thorpe Foundation, but fully 70 years too late, the IOC Executive Board approved, in a sense, the restoration of Jim Thorpe’s medals, declaring him co-winner with Sweden’s Hugo Wieslander (decathlon) and Norway’s Ferdinand Bie (pentathlon). At a meeting of the IOC Executive Board, this time on 18 January 1983 in Los Angeles, commemorative medals were presented to Bill and Gail Thorpe, two of Thorpe’s children. At least some closure had occurred. Finally, the IOC had seen and admitted what the world had always known. Jim Thorpe was the winner of the decathlon and the pentathlon at the 1912 Olympic Games in Stockholm, and despite all the century-ending polls to the contrary, still, over 100 years later, “You, sir, are the greatest athlete in the world.” And the story did not end there. After years of dedicated effort, led in part by Wheeler and Ridlon, with a group called Bright Path Strong, and assistance from IOC Member Anita DeFrantz, finally, in 2022, the IOC restored Thorpe as the sole gold medalist and would now list Bie and Wieslander as co-silver medalists. The official announcement from the IOC on 15 July 2022 was as follows: “On 15 July 2022, on the day of the 110th anniversary of Thorpe’s medal in decathlon, the IOC announced its decision to display the name of Jim Thorpe as the sole gold medallist in pentathlon and decathlon at the Olympic Games Stockholm 1912. The IOC explained in its communication that this development was possible after the engagement of the Bright Path Strong organisation, supported by IOC Member Anita DeFrantz, who had contacted the Swedish Olympic Committee (SOC) and the surviving family members of Hugo K. Wieslander, who had been named as the gold medallist in decathlon when Thorpe was stripped of his medals in 1913. The family had confirmed that Wieslander himself had never accepted the Olympic gold medal allocated to him, and had always been of the opinion that Jim Thorpe was the sole legitimate Olympic gold medallist. The same declaration was received from the Norwegian Olympic and Paralympic Committee and Confederation of Sports, whose athlete, Ferdinand Bie, was named as the gold medallist when Thorpe was stripped of the pentathlon title.” Personal Bests: HJ – 1.956 (1912); LJ – 7.16 (1909); Dec – 6564 (1912).","Listed in Olympians Who Played Major League Baseball But Did Not Play Baseball as a Medal Sport at the Olympics (1912 Athletics - decathlon/pentathlon gold medalist - technically Thorpe did play exhibition baseball games at the 1912 Olympics.

Initially he spent two terms at the Royal Naval College in Dartmouth before going to St. John’s College, Cambridge to take an engineering degree. At university he was a member of the Lady Margaret Boat Club and in 1952 became the first Old Wycliffian to compete in the Boat Race. Clack won the Grad Challenge Cup at Henley with Lady Margaret in 1951. Later that year he was part of the last British eight to win an international title prior to the 2000 Olympics, when they beat Denmark by just three feet (0,91m) to win the European Championships at Mâcon, France. Clack then ended the year by helping Lady Margaret win the Cambridge University Fours. He won the Grand again in 1952 when he was a member of the Leander eight that established a record time for the Henley course. The same crew then went to the Helsinki Olympics and finished fourth. In 1953 Clack was given permission from the Admiralty to be one of the coaches of the Cambridge crew for the 100th Boat Race in 1954. Sadly, Oxford won the race. Later that year, Clack and Tom Christie competed in the pairs at the British Empire and Commonwealth Games at Vancouver but were beaten in the final by the New Zealand pair Bob Parker and Reginald Douglas.",Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the British Empire/Commonwealth Games (0–1–0 1954 Vancouver ROW silver: coxless pairs (competed for England))

Worth came to the US through Miami in 1940 and became a US citizen in February 1944. He was a member of the US Olympic teams in 1948, 1952, 1956 and 1960. In 1948, besides the team bronze medal, he finished fifth in the sabre individual, and this is regarded as the outstanding accomplishment of an American sabreur internationally in that era. Worth won the AFLA National Championship in sabre individual in 1954 and was a member of 14 national championship teams, representing the Salle Santelli his entire career. He was also a member of three Pan American teams, winning a gold medal for sabre team in 1951, 1955, and 1959 and a silver medal in sabre individual in 1951 as well as in 1955.

After finishing Iino Senior High School in 1910, he attended the Iiyama Teacher Training Center and had to make a daily roundtrip of about 20 km. In 1911, he proceeded to the Kagawa Prefectural Normal School. He participated in the national trials for the marathon of the Stockholm Olympics, but was defeated by Shizo Kanakuri. Nevertheless, he continued to take part in long-distance races and relays with limited success. In 1915, he started working as a teacher but went on to study at Tokyo Higher Normal School. There, he joined the track club (now the University of Tsukuba Athletics Club), where he benefited from runners like Kanakuri. In 1920, Oura was a member of the victorious team of Tokyo Higher Normal in the first Hakone Ekiden Race. In the same year, he qualified for the Antwerpen Olympics by winning the 5,000 m and placing second in the 10K at the first Japanese trials and winning both events at the second trials. His disappointing appearance at Antwerpen led to greater efforts to promote long-distance running in Japan and particularly the Kagawa prefecture. He then started working as a teacher and was sent to the Japanese puppet state of Manchuria. There, he worked as a teacher and principal at various schools until the end of World War II. Oura returned to Kagawa prefecture in 1947, where he resumed teaching as well as his involvement in promoting long-distance running, mainly serving organizations in Kagawa Prefecture. After retirement, he started to learn English at a very old age and even was examined as an interpreter. It is said that he ran a distance of seven laps around the earth during his lifetime and inspired many future Japanese marathon runners. Personal Best: 5000 – 16:37.8 (1932).",

Exclusively a freestyler, Medved made his international début at the 1961 World Championships, where he won bronze in the middleweight, but then he switched to light-heavyweight. His first title was in 1962 when he won the World Championships. He later won Olympic gold as a light-heavyweight (1964) and super-heavyweight (1968, 1972). His World Championships came at light-heavyweight (1962, 1963, and 1966), and super-heavy (1967, 1969, 1970, and 1971). He was European Champion in 1966, 1968, and 1972, competing less often at that meet. He was a Soviet Champion in 1961-63 and 1966-70. As a super-heavyweight, Medved’s record is more impressive when one considers that he was small for that class (his maximum weight was about 110 kg. [242 lbs.]), usually wrestling much heavier opponents. He carried the Soviet flag at the opening ceremony of the 1972 Olympics and recited the Officials’ Oath at the Opening Ceremony of the 1980 Olympics.

After the fall of the Soviet Union, Medved became vice-president of the Belorussian National Olympic Committee and head of the Inter-University Department of Sport Excellence of the Belarusian State University of Informatics and Radioelectronics. Medved also coached the Belorussian freestyle wrestling team and carried the Belorussian flag at the opening ceremony of the 2004 Olympics. In 2001 Medved was chosen as the best Belorussian athlete of the 20th century and, since 1970, an annual wrestling tournament in his honor has been held in Minsk.

Prior to her induction she and Bowden had spent four years (1952-1955) as Canadian pairs champions, three (1953-1955) as North American champions and two (1954-1955) as world champions in figure skating pairs. They were also runner up at the World Championships in 1953 and 1956 and 4th in 1952. The duo had competed at the 1952 Winter Olympics, finishing fifth, but at the 1956 Games they were defeated narrowly (and controversially) by only the Austrians. Among the moves that Dafoe and Bowden pioneered were the twist lift, the overhead lasso lift, the throw jump, and the “leap of faith”. After retiring as a competitor in 1956, she worked as a costume designer, designing costumes for figure skaters, as well as for television, theatre and ballet performances. Perhaps her most notable work was the design of 650 costumes for the closing ceremonies for the 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary. She later worked as a figure skating judge, which was delayed not only due to a suspension from the Canadian Figure Skating Association, but also by Bowden’s career, as the duo were not permitted to be world-level judges at the same time, and Dafoe felt that the older Bowden should have his turn first. Eventually, however, she was a judge at the 1984 World Championships and the 1994 Winter Olympics. In 1991 she was made a Member of the Order of Canada. In addition to the Canadian Sports Hall of Fame, she was also inducted into the Canadian Olympic Hall of Fame in 1958 and the Skate Canada Hall of Fame in 1993.",Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the World Figure Skating Championships (2–2–0 1953 Davos silver: pairs; 1954 Oslo gold: pairs; 1955 Wien gold: pairs; 1956 Garmisch-Partenkirchen silver: pairs)

This placed her third in the World Championship combined event for 1968. Her biggest title came in winning the 1966 slalom World Championships in Chile. She also placed third in the downhill at the 1966 Worlds, but this later became a silver medal when Erika Schinegger, who had won the race, was found in 1967 to have mixed sexual characteristics, and was not allowed to compete at the 1968 Winter Olympics. In 1996 the FIS annulled all of Schinegger’s results from 1966, giving Famose the silver medal. In the World Cup, Famose was the 1966-67 slalom champion for the season, and placed third in the overall. She won two slalom World Cups that year, at Grindelwald and Saint Gervais. She was twice a champion in Arlberg-Kandahar races, winning downhills at Chamonix in 1963 and at Sankt Anton in 1965.

He also represented the British Isles in the 1907 Davis Cup and then toured South Africa with the All-England team in 1908-09. He won more than 50 leading singles titles, including the national titles of Wales (1895), Ireland (1897) and Scotland (1901) and was the Queen’s Club covered court singles champion three times 1897-99. He was widely regarded at the time as the finest player never to win Wimbledon but he came within a whisker of beating Wilfred Baddeley in the 1895 all-comers final. He led by two sets to nil and had a match point in the third set before losing three sets to two. Baddeley went on to win the title when defending champion Joshua Pim withdrew from the Challenge round. Eaves reached the All-comers final again in 1896 and 1897 losing on each occasion to the man who would go on and win the title. With Ernest Lewis, Eaves won the all-comers doubles final at Wimbledon in 1895 but lost the Challenge match to the Baddeley twins, Wilfred and Herbert. Wilberforce Eaves also won many titles outside the British Isles. He was the French covered court champion 1892-94, and in 1897 was the all-comers singles champion at the United States Championships, but lost in five sets to Robert Wrenn in the Challenge Round. Eaves was also champion of New South Wales and Victoria in his native country. When he won the New South Wales title in 1902, now the– Sydney International, he was the last British winner of the title before Tim Henman in 1997. At the 1908 Olympics Eaves reached the men’s singles semi-final without dropping a set and in the semi he won the opening set against fellow Briton Josiah Ritchie who then proved too good for Wilberforce and won in four sets before going on to win the title. Wilberforce won the bronze medal match by beating South Africa’s John Richardson. Eaves also reached the semi-final of the covered court singles but was forced to retire against another Briton, George Caridia. In the covered court doubles he partnered George Hillyard and they lost an epic opening match against Caridia and George Simond in five sets after leading two sets to nil.

He later moved to Stockholm, where he attended the Academy of Art from 1898-1903. In 1905 Wallin married the painter and graphic artist Elin Lundberg (1884-1969) and together they went to Paris and London. After being awarded a travel grant he spent the years 1908-10 in Italy, then continued his studies in Paris, where he lived until 1913, before returning to Sweden. Wallin was considered the most important Swedish romantic painter imagining the Swedish melancholy in his art. Critics consider his gold medal winning painting as a culmination of the Olympic Art Competitions. Following the success he was invited over to America to do a tour with a traveling exhibition. Wallin very often painted his family, wife and seven children. One of their daughters, Bianca (1909-2006), also became a well-known painter, while one of his sons, Sigurd (1916-99), was also an artist. David Wallin was also an accomplished portrait painter and did a series of portraits of famous Swedes including politician Carl Hammerskjöld (1865-1940). The Swedish artists planned to exhibit their works in 1932 only “hors concours“. Through a misunderstanding, however, they officially competed. David Wallin, whose female figure in the center of the painting Vid Arilds strand (At the Seaside of Arild) is reminiscent of Botticelli’s Venus, even won gold. Arild is a fishing village and artists’ colony in the southern Swedish province of Skåne with steep cliffs. The square oil painting was auctioned in 2001 for (only) 36,000 Swedish crowns, at that time just under 4,000 euros. Another work by Wallin, Vila efter badet (Repose After the Bath), is in the collections of the Östergötland Museum. Kvinna som går ner i badet (Woman Descending into Bath) or just Kvinna i badet is also an oil painting. It dates from 1929 and is only 36 x 29 cm in size.

84944,John Curry,Male,9 September 1949,180.0,67, Great Britain,GBR,"John Curry first took up skating at the age of 12 under the guidance of Ken Vickers at the Summerhill Road rink in Birmingham. But in 1965 he left for London to learn from Arnold Gerschwiler and later Alison Smith at Richmond. After winning his first British junior championship in 1967, he won the senior title in 1970. Steadily improving performances in the world and European championships and 11th place in the 1972 Olympics led to invaluable sponsorship being provided by Ed Moseler, an American millionaire. Moseler’s support gave Curry freedom from financial worries, coaching by the renowned Carlo Fassi and superb training facilities at Denver, Colorado. These new-found advantages pain handsome dividends and in 1975 Curry was second in the European and third in the World Championships. In 1976 he opened his Olympic season by taking the European title at Innsbruck and then gave one of the greatest performances in skating history to take the Olympic gold medal. Graceful, athletic and with a perfectly coordinated program, he completely outclassed the rest of the world’s finest skaters. Curry quickly confirmed his position by winning the World Championship at Gothenburg and then turned professional – as the holder of the European, World and Olympic titles he was able to negotiate a highly lucrative contract. He brought a magnificent ice show to London but never forsook his ambition to be an actor. Although he appeared regularly in provincial productions, he never made it to Broadway or the West End. Curry, who was awarded the OBE in 1976, was undoubtedly one of the major influences in popularizing the sport in Britain and, remembering his early struggle to finance his own training, he was a generous supporter of the National Skating Association. Curry was one of the first openly gay male skaters and was also one of the first to succumb to AIDS.",Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the European Figure Skating Championships (1–1–1 1974 Zagreb bronze: singles; 1975 København silver: singles; 1976 Genève gold: singles) Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the World Figure Skating Championships (1–0–1 1975 Colorado Springs bronze: singles; 1976 Göteborg gold: singles)

These were held in Moscow, and Spain did not maintain diplomatic relationships with the USSR. Blume was able to compete at the 1957 European Championships, which he dominated. He won the all-around (beating Yury Titov), the parallel bars, rings and pommel horses, and gained a silver medal in the horizontal bar. Blume’s life was cut short in a plane crash in early 1959, when he died along with his wife and other members of the Spanish gymnastics team.

During her time at Warszaw University she also started skiing and joined an athletics club. Because her home was quite far from the Polish centers for winter sports and her particular talent for discus throwing was discovered, she focused on the latter. After only a few months of training she broke the world record with 34.15 m. At the 1928 Amsterdam Olympics, women were allowed to compete in athletic events for the first time, and Konopacka claimed the discus gold medal with her third world record of 39.62 m. From her Tartar ancestors she inherited her dark skin color and brown eyes. Together with her model-like physique, this brought her the nickname of Miss Olympia. In her competitions, she always wore a red beret. Later in 1928 she married Colonel Ignacy Matuszewski, who was treasury secretary in inter-war Poland. In 1931 she retired from competitive sports but continued to ski, play tennis and to take part in car races. She was a well-educated woman, speaking three foreign languages fluently. As early as 1929 she published her first book of poetry called “Some Day…”. After the outbreak of World War II, she supported her husband in bringing the Polish National Bank gold out of the country and ultimately to France to finance the Polish Government in exile. When France surrendered the couple went to the United States, where they elected to stay when Poland became part of the Eastern Bloc. Not until 1989 was she honoured by her home country, when she received the “Silver Cross of Merit”. After the sudden death of her first husband, she remarried twice, surviving both men. She founded a skiing school in the state of New York, designed clothing and ran a boutique. At the age of 60 she completed an art college and became a painter. After her death, her ashes was brought to Poland and buried in her parents’ grave on the Bródno Cemetery in Warszaw.

He mainly worked with granite and bronze, but also made woodcuts and sometimes painted in oils. There are also Celtic influences in his oeuvre.

He was European junior champion in 2003 and then marked his emergence into true world class by breaking the 15-minute barrier for the 1,500 in early 2004. He was the fastest qualifier for the Olympic final and contended for the gold before fading into third. Between Athens and Beijing he was a regular medal winner at the major championships and won bronze medals at both the 2005 and 2007 World Championships. With Olympic champion Grant Hackett absent through injury, Davies won the 1,500 freestyle at the 2006 Commonwealth Games in Australia and added a bronze in the 400 free. After winning a silver medal at the European Championships early in 2008, Davies decided to add open water swimming to his schedule in an attempt to double up at the Beijing Olympics and he qualified in only his second race at the 10 km distance. He reached the final of the 1,500 m indoors and was then involved in an epic race in the open water event. Davies, Thomas Lurz and Maarten van der Weijden broke away from field and contested the medals between them. Davies led the race but in the final sprint veered off course which allowed the Dutchman, van der Weijden to power home for victory.

The company went on to become one of Britain’s most successful privately owned aerospace engineering companies. Arthur was educated at Tonbridge School and then Jesus College, Cambridge, where he took a degree in engineering. He obtained his pilot’s licence in 1928 and, the following year, he and his father purchased their first aeroplane, a Gypsy Moth. In his spare time Arthur gave flying lessons and in 1931 became a Master Pilot of the Guild of Air Pilots. Due to his success with giving lessons, Marshall bought some land just outside Cambridge, and it was on this land that the present Cambridge Airport was developed. The techniques of the Marshall Flying School were adopted by the RAF, and the school trained more than 20,000 pilots and instructors. The company also played an important role in World War II, repairing over 5,000 planes. After the War, Marshall Aerospace was developed into a large and successful, aviation maintenance and repair business. They were involved in the design and building of Concorde’s “Droop Snoot”. The company was also involved with the space shuttle Challenger, which made 121 orbits of the earth in 1985. Marshall was chairman of the company from the time of his father’s death in 1942 until 1990, when it was one of the largest privately owned companies in Britain. He carried on working a 65-hour, seven-day week, until he was 86. Marshall was made an OBE in 1948 and was knighted in 1974. He was a High Sheriff of Cambridgeshire and the Isle of Ely, and in 2001 the Sir Arthur Marshall Institute of Aeronautics was formed as part of the Cambridge University engineering department. At the age of 90, Marshall completed his autobiography “The Marshall Story – A Century of Wheels and Wings.” The athletics career of Arthur Marshall was nowhere near impressive as his business career. While at Tonbridge he finished third in the 880 yards at the 1922 Public School Championships and, after going to Cambridge, won both the 440 and 880 in that year’s Freshmen’s Sports. He won his running Blue in 1923 in the 440 yards, in a race won by team-mate Harold Abrahams. Marshall was a reserve member of the Great Britain 4 x 400 metres relay squad at the 1924 Paris Olympics. In 1925 he ran for Cambridge against Oxford in the annual cross-country match and finished seventh. At the time of his death in 2007, Arthur Marshall was 103-years-of-age and was the oldest living Olympian, despite only being a reserve in 1924.",Listed in Olympians Who Reached the Age of 100 () Listed in Olympian Members of the Nobility (Sir)

Later in the season he beat the reigning Olympic champion, Bevil Rudd, in the dual meet between Princeton/Cornell and Oxford/ Cambridge. In 1923, Stevenson went to Oxford on a Rhodes Scholarship and placed second in the match against Cambridge before winning the British title. In the Olympic year he had a poor start to the season, finishing only third in the match against Cambridge and in the British championships, but he fully justified his selection for the Olympic relay team by turning a 2-meter deficit into a 5-meter advantage on the second leg. In 1925, his last year at Oxford, Stevenson finally won the quarter-mile against Cambridge and he closed his career back on American tracks with victories for the combined Oxford/Cambridge team against teams from Harvard/ Yale and Princeton/Cornell. Bill Stevenson, who also represented Oxford at lacrosse, was admitted as a barrister-at-law in England in 1925 and in 1927 he became a member of the New York Bar.

As an athlete he won Balkan Games championships in the long jump in 1935, 1937, and 1938, and the triple jump in 1935-36. But this was almost a footnote to his life. During World War II, he was active in the Greek resistance against the occupying Axis powers, and shortly after World War II, Lamprakis graduated from medical school at the University of Athens. He specialized in gynecology but also set up a small private clinic that helped treat indigent patients. A member of the Pacifist Movement, he was a member of the United Democratic Left, and was elected a member of the Hellenic Parliament in 1961. In that year the Commission for International Détente and Peace (Epitropi gia ti Diethni Ifesi kai Irini – EDYE) was established in Greece, with Lamprakis serving as Vice-President. In April 1963 the EDYE organized a pacifist rally from Marathon to Athina, but the police stopped the rally and arrested many of the protestors who attempted to participate. But Lamprakis had parliamentary immunity and marched the entire course holding a peace banner. It was a banner he had used previously while protesting the Atomic Weapons Research Establishment in Aldermaston, Great Britain. Shortly after his peace walk he was also arrested by the police. On 22 May 1963, Lamprakis was delivering the keynote speech at a pacifist rally in Thessaliníki, when he was attacked by two right-wing extremists who struck him with a club. He sustained a closed brain injury and succumbed to his injury five days later. The following day in Athina, his funeral sparked a demonstration with half a million people rallying to protest against the right-wing government. In his honor, the Marathon Peace Rally has since been held annually in Lamprakis’s memory. The Athina Classic Marathon is also run each November in his honor. His life was memorialized by the author Vassilios Vassilikos in the political novel Z, and in 1969 the book was made into a movie by Greek-French director Kosta Gavras. After the military rulers of Greece were ousted in 1974, many streets and other sites, including a football stadium, were named in honor of Grigorios Lamprakis.

54368,Akira Fujita,Male,1 January 1908,,, Japan,JPN,"Akira Fujita was inspired by his teacher at his elementary school to start swimming. At the Waseda University swim club, where he served as the team captain, many talented swimmers gathered in the first Golden Age of Japanese swimming. Japan’s water polo victory in the 1930 Far Eastern Games tournament led to the formation of a water polo team for the 1932 Olympics. Fujita captained and coached the team, which placed fourth of five teams. He also led Waseda’s team to three consecutive national titles (1931-33). After graduating from Waseda’s Faculty of Commerce, Fujita joined Yokohama Rubber. He remained active as a sports manager for the Dainippon Water Sports Federation, responsible for the water polo section. In World War II, he tried to save the material of the Swimming Federation in the town of Hachioji, but eventually much of it was destroyed during an air raid in August 1945 including films of the 1928 and 1932 Olympics. After the war, Fujita continued to hold various voluntary managements positions in swimming helping the athletes to survive during the times of austerity. To pay the expenses for the Japanese team at the 1952 Helsinki Olympics he collected donations from Yokohama Rubber and other major Japanese companies. At Helsinki, he also served as manager of the Japan’s swimming team. Because he was neglecting his work while doing this, he was transferred and downgraded and was unable to keep up his duties in the Swimming Federation. Later, Fujita resumed his activities and in 1973 became chairman of the Japan Swimming Federation and in the following years reorganized the Federation. He created new competitions for junior athletes, organized overseas exchanges for athletes, and introduced scientific and high-altitude training. In addition, he served as the director of the Japan Sports Association and was a member of the Japan Olympic Committee (JOC). In 1976, he was Deputy Head of the Japanese Montréal Olympic Team and led the Japanese team at the 1982 Asian Games. In 1980, he rallied against a Japanese boycott of the Moskva Olympics. After the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics, he resigned as chairman in the aftermath of a cannabis drug case by Japanese swimmers. As a businessman, Fujita moved to chemical company Nippon Zeon and later served as president of Kanto Rubber. He died at the age of 93 from kidney failure. He wrote a number of books on swimming and was awarded the Medal of Honor with a Blue Ribbon and the Olympic Order in Silver.",Listed in Olympic Order Recipients (1984 (Silver*))

They also competed at the British Championships in 1952 and 1956, placing third both times. After their competitive days ended, Mason became an international judge, including at the 1980 Winter Olympics. In later years she spoke of the difficulty of being an Australian skater in her era, which required long sea voyages to get to international competitions. She was an inaugural inductee to the Ice Skating Australia Hall of Fame in 2004 and was made a life member of the New South Wales Ice Skating Association. She married John Kendall-Baker in July 1960, who was the manager of the Prince Alfred Park outdoor rink. Their daughter, Simone Moore, also became a top figure skater and international judge, but died in the 2007 Merinda tragedy, in which the HarbourCat ferry Pam Berridge collided with the Merinda, a pleasure cruiser, in Sydney Harbour, sinking the Merinda.",

In fact, at the 1908 London Olympics, he took part in the team event and was also a judge for the individual competition. Drury first joined the Linacre Bible Class Gymnastics Club (Bootle, Merseyside) in 1900 as a 17-year-old. In 1906 he represented Lancashire in the first ever inter-county match against Yorkshire at Bradford. Two years later, Drury appeared at the London Olympics, and at Stockholm in 1912 was a member of the British team that won the team bronze medal. Drury won the Liverpool and District team competition for the Bowring Shield with both the Liverpool Gymnasium and the Linacre Club. In 1908 he won the Cookson Challenge Cup as the best individual overall gymnast in Lancashire and Cheshire. It was regarded as the “Blue Riband” event of north-west gymnastics at the time. A blacksmith by trade, Drury was an excellent all-round sportsman and won trophies at running hurdling, jumping, swimming, wrestling, and weightlifting. He was also the Liverpool and District one-mile roller skating champion on two occasions, and also took part in motor cycle trials. Drury was a vice-president of the Amateur Gymnastic Association (AGA) and president of the Northern Counties AGA. He judged at the English National Championships on many occasions, and donated the H. J. Drury Challenge Cup to be contested annually between gymnasts from Liverpool and Belfast. Drury was scheduled to be a judge at the 1936 Berlin Olympics but, after a long illness, he died just three weeks before the start of the Games.",Cousin of Septimus Francom

47428,Norman Wainwright,Male,4 July 1914,,, Great Britain,GBR,"Norman Wainwright started swimming at the age of 3½, thanks largely to his father being the manager of the local swimming baths in Hanley, Stoke-on-Trent. Norman went on to become the leading British freestyle swimmer in the decade leading up to the outbreak of World War II. He set no fewer than 50 Amateur Swimming Association (ASA) and British native records. He also captured 21 ASA titles, winning the 880 yards and mile titles in 1933-35, 1937 and 1939, the 220 and 440 titles five years in succession, 1935-39. His one other title was the 500 yards in 1934, the last time this distance was contested. Wainwright competed in three Olympic Games, 1932, 1936 and 1948, despite originally asking the ASA not to consider him for the latter, due to business commitments. Although he did not win an Olympic medal, he enjoyed success internationally. In 1934 he won his only major gold medal, in the 4 x 200 yards freestyle relay at the British Empire Games in London, when he also won silver in the individual 440 and bronze in the 1500 yards. That same year, Wainwright won a bronze medal in the 1500 metres at the European Championships, the week after the Empire Games. He collected three more bronze medals in 1938, in the 1650 yards freestyle at the Empire Games, and individual 400 metres free and 4 x 200 free relay at the Europeans. The War years interrupted Wainwright’s career and he saw active service in Iraq. He resumed his career after the hostilities but, being in his mid-30s, did not add to his collection of ASA titles. However, he finished second in the 220 in 1948 and was honoured with the captaincy of the British team at the Olympics. Wainwright represented England in eight international matches between 1933-39, and in 1934 was appointed captain for the triangular match with Wales and Scotland, at the age of 20. He retired from competitive swimming in the early 1950s, as he was approaching the age of 40, but he continued to support his sport by serving the Staffordshire and Northern Counties ASA for more than 25 years, until his retirement in 1981.","Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the European Aquatics Championships (0–0–3 1934 Magdeburg SWM bronze: 1500 m freestyle; 1938 London SWM bronze: 400 m freestyl and 4×200 m freestyle relay) Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the British Empire/Commonwealth Games (1–2–2 1934 London SWI silver: 440 yards freestyle and 4×200 yards freestyle, bronze: 1500 yards freestyle (competed for England); 1938 Sydney SWI gold: 4×220 yards freestyle, bronze: 1650 yards freestyle (competed for England))"

Prior to World War I he worked as a bank manager and dog breeder in Napanee, Ontario and later fought overseas with the Royal Canadian Army during the conflict.

In 2008, after both men had met with mixed results in other boats, he teamed up with Iain Percy to campaign for Olympic selection in the Star class. The two men had been close friends since boyhood but they struggled in their early events and placed 52nd at the World Championships in 2008. By Beijing the combination clicked together and they won the Olympic title in a desperately close competition against the Swedish duo. The pair continued their successful ways by winning a silver medal at the 2009 European Championships and a gold medal at the World Championships in 2010. Their medal-winning streak was broken in 2011 when Percy suffered a back injury that led to their withdrawal from the World Championships. The duo narrowly failed to defend their Olympic title on home waters at Weymouth in 2012 when they lost out on gold after a final race duel with the Brazilian crew wrecked both teams chances and let Sweden take the championship. Following the London Games Simpson joined the crew of the Swedish America’s Cup challenge. Whilst training in San Francisco Bay in May 2013 he became trapped under the boat after a capsize and could not be revived by paramedics after spending ten minutes underwater. In memory of his friend, Iain Percy founded the Andrew Simpson Sailing Foundation in 2013, with the aim of helping sailors at the grass roots level of the sport, and also to provide opportunities to deserving children who would otherwise not get the opportunity to enjoy the thrill of sailing,",Listed in Olympians Who Died in Competition or Training (Died in San Francisco Bay while training for the America's Cup.)

He quit school at the age of 14 to work in his father’s builder’s merchant business. He started his football career with the South China Athletic Association’s “B”-team in 1922 and, as a talented striker, became a member of the “A”-team in 1923. In the same year, he played his first game with the Chinese national team at the Far Eastern Games, competing there again in 1925, scoring five goals in two matches. From 1926 until 1930 he captained the newly founded Loh Hwa team in Shanghai, challenging the local supremacy of Westerners in football. In 1931 he returned to Hong Kong and the SCAA, where he played until 1947. As captain of the national team he won two more titles at the Far Eastern Games and took part in the 1936 Olympics. In the war between Japan and China, Li left Hong Kong for the Chinese mainland. He refused to cooperate with the occupying power and played in many fundraising games to support victims of the war.

He retired in 1947 to become Hong Kong’s football coach, and was engaged in writing and broadcasting about soccer in newspapers and other media.

In 1965 Li also started a career as a football official, becoming vice-chairman of the Chinese Taipei Football Association and, as the first Chinese individual in this position, vice-president of FIFA. Li was considered the best Chinese football player of all time, having scored more than 1,200 goals.

Two years later, he set the Finnish national 10,000 metres record at 37:44.6, and then took up the marathon. Nieminen won the first Finnish race over a marathon-type distance in 1907, when he defeated a very young Hannes Kolehmainen, who finished third. On 16 September 1906, Nieminen ran 3-01:06 for 40.2 km to win a race from Helsinki to Tikkurila. He made his first international appearance in 1907 and one year later represented his country in the marathon at the 1908 London Olympics, where he placed 10th in a field of 55 starters. After one more year of amateur racing, he moved to the United States in late 1909 to race professionally, during the marathon craze of the 1910s. His first professional race was on 29 November 1910 when he and Willie Kolehmainen, Hannes’ brother, finished third in a two-man marathon relay at Madison Square Garden in New York. In October 1912, Nieminen finished third in a marathon in 2-43:10 at the Eastern Motordome in the Vailsburg section of Newark, New Jersey, a race won by Willie Kolehmainen. Nieminen coached distance running at Columbia University for a time and became an American citizen in the 1910s while living in New York. He settled in Vermont where he worked, at various times, as a carpenter, masseur, and fox farmer. After the 1920s, he lost contact with his native country and was declared dead in absentia in 1971.

His older brother Ettore later became one of the most famous automobile manufacturers in the world. Both grew up in an environment around famous artists. In Rembrandt’s youth he was a friend of Paolo Prince Trubetskoy. Bugatti’s sculptures of animals such as elephants, panthers and lions became his most valuable and popular works. The silver elephant mascot that sits on top of the radiator of the Bugatti Royale was cast from one of Rembrandt’s original sculptures. In 1916 he committed suicide, poisoning himself after he learned that the Antwerpen Zoo, which was his main object to study wild livestock (elephants, tigers, lions), had been forced to kill most of their animals during World War I. Rembrandt Bugatti was one of the pioneers of Art Deco in Italy and was considered one of the most important animal sculptors of his time. He received his first training from his father and Trubetskoy. In 1904 the family moved to Paris, where he exhibited with great success. As early as at the age of 25 he was appointed Knight of the Legion d’Honneur. In 1907 he went to Antwerpen. There, he worked for the Red Cross during the World War I before he fled to Paris. In just 15 years of artistic activity, he created 150 mostly small sculptures. It is not known which of his works Bugatti entered in Stockholm. In previous years he had created several stone and bronze sculptures of athletes, including the larger-than-life statue of the Naked Giant from 1907, which can now be seen in the garden of the Olympic Museum in Lausanne.",Listed in Olympians Who Committed Suicide (Committed suicide by poisoning with gas in his Studio.)

Earlier in the year, she won her only other international medal when she also won silver, but this time in the high jump at the British Empire Games in Auckland, second to Odam-Tyler, losing the gold medal on the count-back. In addition to her two pentathlon titles, Crowther won just one other WAAA title, the 80 metres hurdles in 1946. However, between 1947-51, she had a total of nine other podium finishes in the sprint hurdles, high jump, long jump and pentathlon. The daughter of a north London wholesale butcher, Crowther was brought up in the shadow of Wembley Stadium, and always dreamt of appearing there in the London Olympics from the moment she finished equal fourth in the high jump at the 1937 WAAAs at the age of 15. The winner that day was the 1936 Olympic champion Dorothy Odam, and that was the start of a rivalry between the two women that would continue throughout Crowther’s athletic career. Having attended Wembley County School, where she was an outstanding all-round athlete and county hockey player, Crowther later became a physical education teacher at the school before taking up a similar position at Barking Abbey School. In 1950, she worked as an assistant lecturer in the physical education department at Birmingham University and when the WAAA inaugurated their women’s coaching scheme, at Bisham Abbey, Crowther was chosen as an honorary instructor. On moving to Cheshire, she taught at Tarporley Grammar School for six years before taking up a physical education lecturer’s post at Crewe and Alsager College.

921031,Jean Jacoby,Male,26 March 1891,,, Luxembourg,LUX,"Luxembourger Jean Jacoby studied at the École des Beaux-Arts at Strasbourg in Alsace and became an art teacher (1912-18), then a church painter at Wiesbaden, before he returned to Strasbourg, taking over the management of a printing company. From 1926-34 Jacoby worked as an illustrator for newspapers and the Ullstein Publishing House. In 1934 he returned to Alsace and lived in Mulhouse. He died of a heart attack in 1936. Jacoby often depicted sports in his works and designed postage stamps for Luxembourg. These stamps commemorated the 1952 Olympic Games in Helsinki and the 1952 World Cycling Championships. The 1984 Olympic Games edition was posthumous, also based on his works. Earning two gold medals for his works Three Sports Studies (1924) and Rugby (1928), as well as two Honorable Mentions (1932 and 1936), he became the most successful Olympic artist ever. He is also considered one of the most prolific Olympic artists. His second wife Maria Jacoby also took part in the 1936 Olympic Games’ art competitions in painting, applied arts (out of competition). Jacoby received the gold medal in painting for three studies, Corner Ball, Start and Rugby, in 1924. Two of them, painted in oil on wood in the same year, are now in the Olympic Museum in Lausanne: Corner (104 x 67 cm) and Rugby (99 x 59.5 cm). Four years later, a charcoal drawing with the theme Rugby earned him the gold medal in the Drawings and Water Colors section. Of his five entries in Amsterdam, Water-Polo and Le Match de Championnat de Football were paintings. Saut en longueur, like Rugby, was a charcoal drawing that was also printed as a lithograph (size 65 x 48 cm). The model was the French track and field athlete and Olympian Robert Paul. For the drawing Tennis and the watercolor Boxing there are various options in his oeuvre, but due to partial lack of temporal classification they cannot be clearly assigned. In 1932 Jacoby participated with four oil paintings and drawings or graphics each. The paintings could be clearly identified: The Last 20 m (1932, oil on wood, 112 x 87 cm), Ice Hockey (1932, oil on canvas, 114 x 90 cm), Football in Winter (also known as Football in the Snow, oil on canvas, 77 x 65 cm) and Water Polo (aka Before the goal - Water Polo, 1932, oil on canvas, 59 x 48.5 cm). The latter is also in the inventory of the Lausanne Olympic Museum. Of the drawings, only one could be clearly traced. (In front of the goal -) field hockey is a charcoal drawing measuring 100 x 80 cm; this is not entirely certain for 110 m hurdles, possibly identical to Course de haies (Hurdle race, charcoal mixed media, 75 x 105 cm). Some assistance in identifying Jacoby’s paintings for the 1936 art competitions is provided by photographs of Luxembourg’s section of the exhibition. The three large-scale works Start, Kampf and Ziel, a triptych of a hurdle race, were planned as murals for a clubhouse. Kampf normally appeared under the title Le passage des haies (Over the hurdles). All works were painted in oil on wood. The format was 152 x 206 cm for the outer paintings and 152 x 250 cm for the center one. Lithographs based on charcoal drawings made up the majority of Jacoby’s works for the art competitions in Berlin, including Rugby (1936, 60 x 80 cm), Football (1935, 82 x 112 cm), Road Racers (aka Cyclisme, 1936, 72 x 92 cm), Boxing (1936, 75 x 92 cm), and Discus Thrower (76 x 54 cm). The same technique was used to create Le skieur (1936, 100 x 90 cm, LIthography 88 x 67.5 cm). The Football scene was a 102 x 80 cm lithograph from 1935, but the correlation with Football (Corner) is uncertain. Cutouts from Water polo were apparently used for posters. Jacoby regularly worked on the topic Ice Hockey, for example in the charcoal drawing (100 x 80 cm) for the art competitions in 1936, which was reproduced as a lithograph in the format 75 x 92 cm. In 1952, the motif was included in the stamps of Luxembourg for the Olympic Games in Helsinki, as well as the Road Racers. Probably the original charcoal drawings of all these works were exhibited in 1936. A Series of Etchings on the 8th Chant of the Odyssey showed five Greek sports scenes: The Runner Klytoneos, The Long Jumper Amphialos, The Wrestler Euryalos, The Discus Thrower Elatreus and The Fist Fighter Laodamas. They were also produced as lithographs after charcoal drawings. All sheets were 52 x 41 cm and were created in 1936. As a tribute “To the Olympic Games of Greece” they were sold collected in a portfolio.",Husband of Maria Jacoby

Perugino went on to win all 23 of his professional bouts (8 by KO) but, unfortunately, he is better known for personal and tragic family events. As an amateur, Perugino was the Italian light-middleweight champion from 1992-95 and he competed in that division at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, where he lost to the eventual silver medallist, the Cuban Alfredo Duvergel, in the quarter-finals. Perugino turned professional in 1997 and on 30 July 1998 won the Italian middleweight title by beating Valentino Manca, retaining it against the same opponent five months later. He vacated the title in 1999 in an attempt to further his career internationally. O 11 February 2003, however, Perugino’s career came to an end. Fighting Argentinian Orlando Javier Acuna at Bormio, Perugino won his 23rd consecutive bout with a unanimous decision. He received a lot of punches, however, which was a rarity for the Italian, and upon returning to his hotel room collapsed and was taken to hospital. He underwent six hours of surgery, was in a coma for 12 days and then underwent a month of rehabilitation before returning to his native city, San Prisco, where he was welcomed home as a champion for winning his latest battle, against possible death. Perugino never went back into the ring, and his younger brother Claudio, an Italian amateur champion, also gave up the sport following his brother’s accident. Two years earlier, another brother, Prisco, an Italian featherweight champion, was found dead in mysterious circumstances alongside a railway track.",Listed in Olympians Who Received the Italian Olympic Association (CONI) Gold Medal ()

In 1952 he won both the South-West London, and London Championships at light-welterweight before going on to beat Colin Harrison for the ABA title. Waterman then made his international début for England against Wales before going to the Helsinki Olympics. He was just 17-years-old at the time and reached the second round before losing to the South African Alexander Webster. Regarded as one of the brightest British prospects in the 1950s, Waterman turned professional after the Olympics, and between 1952-58 won 42 of 47 bouts with just three defeats. He enjoyed a memorable, if not extremely controversial, win over the experienced Cuban Kid Gavilan in 1956. Gavilan avenged that defeat, however, with a points-win over ten rounds at Earls Court a couple of months later. It was Waterman’s first defeat in 35 professional fights. He bounced back in his very next fight, however, to beat Wally Thom and take the British Welterweight title at the age of 21. He retained the title with a win over Frank Johnson later in 1956. Waterman had a crack at the European welterweight title in 1957 but fought out a draw with the defending champion Emilio Marconi of Italy. In the return bout, however, Waterman won the title when the referee stopped the fight in the 14th round with the Italian suffering a badly cut eye when well ahead on points. Less than three months later Waterman fought the British lightweight champion Dave Charnley in a non-title fight, but was prevented from taking any further punishment in the fifth round by the referee, and Waterman had to be helped back to his dressing room. A few days later he announced his retirement from boxing, and he subsequently underwent surgery to damage on his brain. His career was cut short at the age of 23.

Bjurstedt-Mallory’s most famous victory came in her second round match against Suzanne Lenglen at the 1921 US Championships. Lenglen was ill, later to be called whooping cough, and lost the first set 6-2. In the first game of the second set, Mallory led 40-love when Lenglen came to the net and withdrew. Lenglen avenged that loss at the 1922 Wimbledon final, winning 2 and love in 26 minutes, the shortest final in any Grand Slam championship.

After returning to Fitchburg he worked at the General Electric plant and began competing in cycling, while continuing his speed skating career. He won the 1953 state cycling championship, despite a leaky tire he had developed while riding for 1½ hours to get to the meet, as he had no car. His first major victory came in 1954 in a 170-mile road race from Québec City to Montréal, for which he was named the Canadian Cyclist of the Year. In 1956 Longsjo made the Winter Olympic team for speed skating despite not being able to compete in the Eastern Olympic Trials because of a sprained knee he sustained while training for the event. The USOC granted him the waiver to the final trials because he had won 9 of 11 national-level events in 1954-55. Longsjo’s speed skating efforts in Cortina d’Ampezzo were hampered when he developed the flu shortly before his 5,000 metre event, in which he placed 40th. That summer, Longsjo won almost every cycling race he entered, including the Canadian road race when he launched a single-man breakaway over the steep Mount Savage climb with 80 miles remaining in the race, and he was never caught. He made the Olympic cycling team by finishing second in the road race time trial, although he was then placed in the team pursuit event. By competing in cycling in Melbourne in 1956, Longsjo became the first American, and one of only two (David Gilman), to compete in both the Summer and Winter Olympics in the same year. After breaking a leg and missing the 1957 season, Longsjo dominated the American cycling scene in 1958, winning virtually every race, including the Tour du St. Laurent stage race in Canada, the prestigious Tour of Somerville, and another win in the Québec-Montréal race. After that race, he began the drive back to Fitchburg with a friend driving while he slept in the passenger seat. Late in the evening, on a wet, winding road in northern Vermont, the driver swerved and crashed into a utility pole. Art Longsjo died from injuries sustained in the accident. In his honor, his hometown began a cycling race which remains one of the top races in the United States. It began in 1960 as the Longsjo Memorial Race, later renamed to the Fitchburg Longsjo Classic in 1980, although it is often called simply the Tour of Fitchburg.

In 1916, his mother married Pieter van Klaveren, whose name he took. After primary school, Bep worked as a butcher’s boy and boxed in his spare time. When he was 16 he started serious training and competing officially. Strangely enough, the butcher’s boy became a vegetarian during this period, feeling it would improve his boxing abilities. In 1926 he gained his first Dutch title as a flyweight and from 1927-29, won three titles as a featherweight. After his Olympic success in 1928, he received a hero’s welcome in his hometown Rotterdam and was presented to the Dutch Queen and her prince consort. In 1929 Van Klaveren turned professional. His career saw him fight on four continents and in many countries over an amazing 27-year span. The winner of national and European lightweight titles in the early 30s, he campaigned for many years in the United States. In 1935 he married his first wife, Margarite Olivera, a banker’s daughter. It is reported that through her spendthrift ways, and a manager who ran off with his wages, he lost most of his money, and after beating his wife, served a year in prison for assault. Three months later he was released on bail and left immediately for Rotterdam, leaving behind all his possessions. In July 1938 he regained the European title, this time as a middleweight, but held it just for a few months. Van Klaveren returned to America when World War II broke out. After some years of overseas service in the Dutch army he resumed his career and won the national middleweight title. At the urging of his second wife, an Australian nurse, he headed for Australia, where he worked as a sports teacher, dock worker, bouncer, and gave boxing lessons. He returned to Rotterdam and retired at age 41, but that was only temporary. He resumed fighting at the age of 47, and went on a remarkable run of victories that culminated in an attempt at the European welterweight title. Van Klaveren never boxed for a world title, which he claimed was to due mafia control of these matches. Van Klaveren fought his last bout on 19 March 1956, also marrying a third and last time that year. The couple ran a cigar ship for several years, but he eventually failed as a businessman. He continued to train until shortly before his death, and never took up smoking nor drinking. As the only Dutch boxer to have won Olympic gold he remains a legendary figure in his native country. A statue of Van Klaveren, in fighting pose, was erected in his hometown of Rotterdam after his death in 1992.

It was only eight years prior that he had first fallen in love with the sport, after witnessing an event as a spectator at the 1956 Winter Olympics while on a tour of Europe. With his brother John, he founded the Laurentian Bobsledding Association in 1957 and in 1959 they were able to enter a team in the World Championships, where they were given advice and coaching from Italian champion Eugenio Monti. A mere three years later, their four-man team had finished in fourth at these games. Practice, however, was difficult, because the Canadian Olympic Committee refused to acknowledge the sport, going so far as to reject the idea of sending a bobsled team to the 1960 Winter Olympics. Thus, the Emery brothers were forced to practice in Lake Placid, New York and practice starts in dry gymnasiums. At Innsbruck, they only had four practice runs, far less than other teams who had been testing the run for weeks. Not only did the team win the gold in 1964, but it was the only Canadian Olympic gold that year and they managed to repeat their feat at the next year’s World Championships. A member of the Canada Sports Hall of Fame and the Canadian Olympic Hall of Fame, Emery is a graduate of the University of Western Ontario and holds an MBA from Harvard University. He retired from the sport several years after the 1965 championships and returned to business endeavors. He eventually retired to London, England, although he often frequents Oslo, Norway.","Brother of John Emery Bearer of the Olympic Flag at the opening ceremony of the 1988 Winter Olympics Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the World Bob & Skeleton Championships (FIBT/IBSF) (1–0–1 1965 St. Moritz gold: Four-man, bronze: Two-man)"

Malitz was captured by the French during World War II and only released after the end of the war. In the 1950s Malitz became a successful cyclist, both on the road and track. He won five East German national titles on the track and won the 1957 Tour of Egypt. In 1956, at the Olympic Games in Melbourne, he was part of the unified German pursuit team, together with Manfred Gieseler from West Germany and the East Germans Siegfried Köhler and Rolf Nitzsche. They lost their first round match against Great Britain by a wide margin. The lap scorer miscounted the laps and sounded the bell a lap too late, so no finishing sprint times were measured. After his active career Malitz became a cycling coach for different clubs in East Germany and a national coach for tandem and sprint. He retired early at the time of German reunification. He later supported young cyclists for many years as an advisor. He died in 2017 at the age of 90 in a Berlin nursing home.",

He immortalized common people in his paintings, figures and rustic scenes of everyday life, with soft colors and pastels. He also dealt with fiction, non-fiction, theater, and television and in 1972 became director of the Brera Academy in Milan. With his entry, the painting Ciclisti in riposo (Resting Cyclists), he previously participated successfully in the third exhibition of “Art and Sport”.",

He was an aggressive rather than a particularly skilful rider, but he was a long and accurate striker of the ball. Hitchcock played for the US in every international match between 1920 and 1940, with only two exceptions. During this period he was on the winning team in every match except the Cup of the Americas in 1936. Following a bad injury in 1933, it was thought his career might be over but he made a remarkable comeback and played on the Greentree side that beat Aurora 6-5 to win the US Open in 1935. As a 17-year-old at St. Paul’s school he tried to enlist in the Aviation Section of the Army Signal Corps for service in World War I. Having been rejected on the grounds of his youth, he enlisted with the French forces and went overseas, later transferring to the U.S. Air Service. Hitchcock was shot down over enemy lines while flying a mission for the famous Lafayette Escadrille and spent a number of months in hospitals and prison camps. While being transferred between camps he jumped from a train as it was crossing a river and, although still wounded and walking only at night, he covered the 100 miles to the Swiss border in just eight days. He was awarded the French Croix de Guerre. After the war, Hitchcock was educated at Harvard and Oxford. Substantial family interests enabled him to devote much of his time to polo and he maintained a 10-goal handicap for 18 years from 1922-40, with the exception of 1935. At the outbreak of World War II he rejoined the Army Air Corps and served as assistant air attaché to the embassy in London in 1942. His adventurous life came to an end when he was killed in an army Mustang airplane crashed in Salisbury, England shortly after it crashed after leaving the 9th Air Force fighter station. In civil life, Hitchcock worked for investment bankers Lehman Brothers and being a keen flyer, he flew to work each day, ‘parking’ his boat-plane in New York harbour close to Wall Street. He was married to Margaret Mellon, niece of Andrew Mellon who came from one of America’s wealthiest families.",Listed in Olympians Who Were Killed or Missing in Action or Died as a Result of War (†19 April 1944.

After completing his studies in Lyon and Paris, Chaurand-Naurac lived in phalanstères, which are socio-utopian production and living communities. His motifs were genre scenes with horses, but also landscapes, portraits and flowers, which he depicted in oil, pastel and watercolor. Initially, he was influenced by Cubism and Fauvism, and later strongly by the Italian Futurists. In 1924, Chaurand-Naurac created a collection of ten color lithographs on the subject of the Olympic Games. Here, the following sports were illustrated in Art Deco style: Basque pelota, rowing, hurdling, tennis, soccer (male and female), rugby, swimming, hockey, shot put. Three of these correspond to the motifs submitted to the art competitions. At least some sports, however, have been depicted several times by this artist. Le joueur de Pelote Basque is said to have been produced specifically for the 1928 art competitions.

82308,Laila Schou Nilsen,Female,18 March 1919,,, Norway,NOR,"Laila Schou Nilsen is reckoned by many as the greatest sportswoman in Norwegian history. Her versatility was remarkable as she excelled in every sport she tried: ski jumping, cross-country skiing, alpine skiing, tennis, speed skating, handball, and she even participated in the Monte Carlo Rally four times. At age 11, she showed great talent as a ski jumper, but was not allowed to compete against the boys. However, she was invited to make the opening jump in the biggest national competition in ski jumping for boys in 1931, and impressed with a stylish jump of 28 meters. In 1933, still not 14, she competed in the unofficial national cross-country 5 km skiing championships for women in Oslo, and surprised everybody by crossing the finishing line in a time almost six minutes better than her closest opponent. Some people could not believe her performance, and a newspaper published a letter accusing the organizers of letting her take a shortcut during the race. But she had definitively passed all four control posts during the race and indeed passed 17 of her opponents. In her teens she concentrated on tennis during the summer and speed skating in the winter. In speed skating she won her first national championship in 1935 and some weeks later, still only 15, won the unofficial World Championships in her home town Oslo, beating the US favorite Kit Klein and breaking the world record in the 500 metres. Some speed skating officials told her that speed skating for women would be on the program for the 1936 Olympic Winter Games. She then decided to train hard with the aim of competing in Garmisch-Partenkirchen, but later she was told that besides figure skating, alpine skiing would be the only sport for women in Garmisch-Partenkirchen. The 16-year old Laila then switched to alpine skiing, and after Christmas 1935 she trained for alpine skiing, managing to qualify for the Norwegian team, and surprised everybody by winning the downhill part of the Alpine combined. In slalom she had to stop during the race and dropped down to third position in the overall standings, winning a bronze medal. In 1937 she returned to speed skating with great success. At the World Championships in Davos she won all four distances, setting four world records. In 1938 she first qualified for the World Alpine Championships in Engelberg by winning the national qualification competition in slalom. She then competed in the World Speed Skating Championships in Oslo, defending her title from 1937. Two days later she left Oslo by train for Engelberg and the World Alpine Skiing Championships. However, her results were disappointing, placing only eighth in the downhill after a bad fall and ending seventh in the Alpine Combination. In the following years before the outbreak of World War II she contined to compete in speed skating, alpine skiing and tennis, winning several national championship titles. After the war she competed in the 1948 Winter Games in alpine skiing, but concentrated mostly on tennis and handball. When she ended her impressive competitive career in 1961 she had won 101 national championships titles, 83 in tennis (between 1937-61), 10 in alpine skiing (1939-48), four in speed skating (1935-40) and four in handball (1946-51). In 1936 she was awarded the prestigeous Egebergs Ærespris (given to athletes excelling in more than one sport), aged only 17, the youngest athlete to ever receive the prize. She was also a successful businesswomen, starting her own sports equipment business after the war and later was a managing director of the Splitkein Ski Factory. She was Vice-President of the Norwegian Confederation for Sports from 1969-73. After her retirement she usually spent the winters in Lanzarote in the Canary Islands. In the spring of 1998, she became ill and could not return to Norway for her usual summer stay. Shortly thereafter she died in Lanzarote, aged 79.","Listed in Olympians Who Led the Adelskalender (speed skating) (Allround – 24 January 1937 - 21 January 1952: 217.876 (24 January 1937; Oslo, NOR), 213.393 (30 January 1937; Davos, SUI), 207.563 (31 January 1937; Davos, SUI)) Listed in Olympians Who Set a World Record in Speed Skating (500 m – 27 February 1935 - 11 January 1955: 49.3 (27 February 1935; Oslo, NOR), 46.4 (30 January 1937; Davos, SUI); 1000 m – 31 January 1937 - 5 February 1951: 1:38.8 (31 January 1937; Davos, SUI); 1500 m – 23 January 1937 - 25 February 1950: 2:38.1 (23 January 1937; Oslo, NOR); 3000 m – 30 January 1937 - 30 January 1949: 5:29.6 (30 January 1937; Davos, SUI); 5000 m – 31 January 1937 - 13 February 1949: 9:28.3 (31 January 1937; Davos, SUI)) Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the World Allround Speed Skating Championships (3–0–0 1935 Oslo gold: Allround; 1937 Davos gold: Allround; 1938 Oslo gold: Allround) Listed in Olympians Who Were Awarded Egebergs Ærespris (1936 - alpine skiing, speed skating and tennis)"

He played ice hockey for a number of clubs – Sparta Praha (1914-27), LTC Praha (1927-43), where he had his most successful period, and later Vysokoskolsky SK and, as a player coach, Slovan Bratislava. With LTC, Maleček won five consecutive Czechoslovakian titles from 1931-35 and formed one of Europe’s best forward lines together with Karel Hromádka and Jirí Tožicka, leading the club to eight consecutive national titles from 1931-38. After the German occupation Maleček added another four titles with LTC, winning the championship of the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia (1940, 1942-44). With him, LTC also won the prestigious Spengler Cup four times. In 1941 he changed his preferred position from forward to defense. Altogether Maleček played 107 international games between 1920-39, scoring 114 goals. He won three European titles (1922, 1925, 1929) and was the leading scorer four times. At eight World Championships between 1930 and 1939, he led Czechoslovakia to two bronze medals in 1933 and 1938. Maleček represented Czechoslovakia at 14 World and European Championships and three Olympic Winter Games – 1924, 1928 and 1936. Maleček is universally considered the best pre-War European player. Statistics currently attribute currently 1,708 goals in 684 games to him. He was considered the first 1,000 goal scorer in ice hockey and was attributed with over 250 hat tricks. Maleček was an accomplished track athlete and played first league football for Sparta Praha. He represented Czechoslovakia internationally in hockey (field) and tennis. In tennis, he played Roland Garros in 1933 and was on the 1929 Davis Cup team but did not play. Maleček was also a high level cyclist and golfer. He was successful in running one of Czechoslovakia’s most popular stores for sporting goods in the center of Praha, and later opened a second store in Bratislava. In 1948, after the Communist takeover, Maleček used a Peruvian passport to leave Czechoslovakia. Because of his fame, the border guards recognized him but allowed him to pass. He then served as a player-coach in Switzerland (HC Davos, Crans-Montana) and Germany (Krefeld), and also worked as a tennis coach concurrently. Maleček ended his playing career in Zürich in 1954 at the age of 51 and his coaching career in 1956 in Hannover. He then went to New York where he served as a sports broadcaster for Radio Free Europe, and lived on Long Island, where he died of heart failure in 1982.

In the late 1920s he and several friends formed “Les Quatre Mousquetaires” (The Four Musketeers), an amateur fencing club in Montréal, which rapidly grew in popularity during the 1930s alongside a broader national interest in the sport. Desjarlais developed as well, winning his first amateur foil competition in the city in 1939, and emerging as provincial foil and sabre champion in 1946. By the end of the year he was elected president of the Quebec Fencing Association (now the Fédération d’escrime du Québec). His efforts earned him a trip to the 1948 Summer Olympics as a member of the foil, épée, and sabre teams, but he never advanced beyond the quarterfinals with any of them. He found more success at the 1950 British Empire Games alongside George Pouliot and Edward Brooke, placing second in the team sabre event, and third in the team foil and épée competitions. Individually he placed sixth in foil and seventh in épée and sabre. By 1954 he had retired from active competition and was the co-trainer and competition armourer for the Canadian delegation at that year’s Empire Games. Soon afterwards he founded the Académie des Armes du Québec to train future competitors and coaches and ran the Palestre Nationale fencing hall in Montréal from 1958 to 1966. In 1967 he helped organize that year’s FIE World Championships in Fencing that were held in Montréal and also had an association with the Commonwealth Fencing Federation. Outside of sports he was a lecturer in dramatic arts at the Université de Montréal, Université Laval, and the Conservatoire d’Arts dramatiques in Québec City and Montréal. He was inducted into the Quebec Amateur Sports Hall of Fame in 1974 and the Quebec Fencing Hall of Fame in 2008 as a builder.","Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the British Empire/Commonwealth Games (0–1–2 1950 Auckland FEN silver: team sabre, bronze: team épée and team foil)"

4126,Damiano Lassandro,Male,18 December 1947,173.0,67, Italy,ITA,"Damiano Lassandro was an Italian boxer. As an amateur in the welterweight class, he won an Italian title and took two bronze medals in 1971, at the Madrid European Championships (won by the Olympian János Kajdi) and at the Mediterranean Games (won by the Turkish Olympian Celal Sandal). A year later, at the age of 25, at the München Olympics, the draw was unlucky for Lassandro, as he had to face Cuban Emilio Correa in his first bout, who was one of the favorites in the welterweight division. Unconcerned by the reputation of his opponent, Lassandro started well but, in the first round, a precise and powerful left uppercut to the stomach damaged his physical efficiency. Also injured over his right eye, he fought with bravery in the second round when Correa, perhaps desiring to end the match, hit Lassandro below the belt and received a reproach by the Romanian referee Constantin Kiriac. The last round was characterized by a lot of punches, mostly favorable to Correa, who won the match 5:0 and eventually the gold medal some days later. After the Olympics, Lassandro turned professional and his first fight was a win by TKO against Mario Petrillo in November 1972. After a series of winning bouts, he became Italian champion in the middleweight class on 5 November 1975 after beating, by disqualification, Antonio Castellini, his teammate at München three years before. Castellini won the re-match by TKO in April 1976, just few months before his tragic death in a motorcycle accident. In November 1976 Lassandro was again crowned Italian champion in the super welterweight category by defeating Aldo Bentini, and he remained unbeaten until October 1979. On 13 February 1980 in Pesaro he drew the Yugoslavian Olympian Marijan Beneš for the EBU European super welter title before finishing a year later with a defeat by TKO against Sumbu Kalambay. Lassandro recorded a professional record of 29 wins (18 by KO), 6 losses (all by KO) and 2 draws.",Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the Mediterranean Games (0–0–1 1971 İzmir BOX bronze: welterweight -67 kg)

921076,Isaac Israëls,Male,3 February 1865,,, Netherlands,NED,"While he is less known than his father Jozef (1824-1911), Isaac Israëls earned his fame as an impressionist painter. A Dutchman of Jewish descent, he initially followed in his father’s footsteps in his studio and at the art academy in The Hague, but then moved to Amsterdam in 1885. Together with his friend George Breitner, he became the best known member of the “Amsterdam Impressionists”. After extensive stays in Paris and London between 1903 and 1915 and a year in the Dutch Indies in 1921, he ultimately settled in Amsterdam. He was often compared to Édouard Manet and worked just as often with the German Max Liebermann. One of his famous pictures is Mata Hari, one of many portraits of pretty young women. Israëls died in 1934 after having been hit by a car. According to the Rijksbureau voor Kunsthistorische Documentatie (RKD), Israëls’ winning entry in the 1928 Olympic competition paintings, The Red Rider, is a depiction of engineer Jacobus Pieter Leeuwenburgh (1879-1962) on his horse Tristan. Leeuwenburgh rejected the portrait because he did not like the horse. Subsequently, Israëls entered it in the Olympic competition and changed the title from Rider in a Red Coat to The Red Rider. The painting also received a consistently negative review in the Dutch contemporary press. According to the Dutch catalog, there were two paintings with the title Cavalier Rouge. One was owned by a Mr. Glerum from Amsterdam, and the other one by the art dealer Scherjon from Utrecht. The latter is the painting that was awarded the gold medal, created in oil on canvas in the format 80 x 75 cm between 1920 and 1928. The second Red Rider is unknown. Meeting at the hunt is another equestrian motif, created in 1928 in oil on canvas (101 × 81 cm), now in the Rijksmuseum Twenthe, Enschede. Other titles of the same work include Riders and Horses and the comprehensive Meeting at the Hunt, Courtyard of Zeist Castle, with M.M. Kwint on ‘Puiu’, Hussar Officer J. G. Star Busmann, and Fred Lodder, owner of a riding stable in Zeist, on ‚Jozephine’. He participated in two more Olympic Games, 1924 at Paris and 1932 at Los Angeles. The 1924 paintings consistently show scenes of boxers, at least two of which depict a black boxer who may have been the then popular “Battling Siki”. Best known is the painting showing him in the corner of the ring during a break in the fight. It was painted in 1914/15 (oil on canvas, 101.5 x 76.5 cm) and belongs to the collection of the Centraal Museum in Utrecht. There are several versions in oil and watercolor of the boxer leaning against the ring ropes (e.g. oil on canvas, 75 x 63 cm). There are also charcoal drawings as preliminary studies. All of them were probably made in this period, but beyond that they cannot be assigned. Of the works submitted in 1932, Boxing Lessons is identified, showing two boys before training. The painting (oil on canvas, 60.5 x 50.5 cm) sold at Christie’s in 2013 for just under €50,000. In the contemporary newspaper Sport in Beeld, the other two paintings are described rather disparagingly, “The one canvas shows a boxing ring…. with no boxers. We see a bunch of spectators sitting behind the ring. Make a few slats from the ropes of the ring, and we see farmers, citizens and country people at a livestock show, looking at a pen with beautiful piglets. Black and White is the name of the other canvas: something like a Negro with something like a white man in arm wrestling. A pair of weird red snakes must be boxers’ legs in red tights. I guess this is about color contrast and ‘impression’… For me, however, the main thing is that you get the impression that two savages are attacking each other, but not, that they are boxing.” The description of this “boxing match” is met by the painting Two Boxers (oil on canvas, 152 x 101 cm), which, however, like most of his paintings of boxers, was created as early as 1914/15. It is possible that this work was submitted as early as 1924, and possibly again in 1932.","Listed in Olympians Who Died in Motor Vehicle Accidents (Boat/Car/Motorcycle/Train) (Died at home, two days after he was hit by a car.)"

He made the move to Ontario the following year and played with the Hull-Ottawa Canadiens in its various incarnations, and into its successor team the Brockville Canadiens , from 1956 through 1960. He played two games with Rochester Americans of the American Hockey League in 1959, but his future truly began to take off in 1960. Not only did he compete in the playoffs for Canada’s Memorial Cup, given annually to the Canadian men’s junior ice hockey champions, with the Canadiens, but he was also invited to join the Kitchener-Waterloo Dutchmen as they represented Canada at the 1960 Winter Olympics. At the tournament he played in seven matches, scored five goals, and took home a silver medal. The following year, Rousseau was recruited by the Montreal Canadiens of the National Hockey League and he would remain a professional hockey player for the next fifteen years. The first ten of those were spent in Montreal and he gradually built up an impressive record with the team. His first accolade came in 1962 when he won the Calder Trophy, given annually to the NHL’s top rookie. He was eligible for the award, despite being in his second NHL season, because he had spent most of the previous year with the Hull-Ottawa Canadiens and had only played 15 games with the Montreal Canadiens, less than 25-game maximum to be considered a rookie. On February 1, 1964 he scored five goals in one match, becoming only the 18th player in NHL history to achieve that mark. In total he won four Stanley Cups with Montreal, in 1965, 1966, 1968 and 1969. He was traded to the Minnesota North Stars in 1970, and traded again to the New York Rangers in 1971, where he spent the final four seasons of his career. After his 1975 retirement he has been an avid golfer and skates annually with his family on New Year’s Day. He is one of 12 siblings and credits his success to the book “The Power of Positive Thinking”.

He was taught in amateur and Catch-as-Catch-Can wrestling styles by fellow Leigh-man Harry Pennington, and Reid went on to become one of Britain’s leading amateur and professional wrestlers. Reid continued fighting into the mid-1960s when, despite being past his best physically, he was as mentally alert as many of his younger opponents. Despite his slight build, Reid was a deceptively good bantamweight. He represented England in the first ever British Empire (now Commonwealth) Games at Hamilton, Canada, in 1930 and won a silver medal in the bantamweight freestyle class. He won a bronze when the Games were held in London four years later, having also won a bronze at the 1933 European Championships. However, at the 1932 Olympics, Reid was eliminated after the third round, and failed to win a medal. Whilst success was limited on the international stage, Reid was invincible at home and won the British bantamweight championship every year from 1931-35. After his successful amateur career, he turned professional and often fought men much bigger than himself, including Sid Milligan, who Joe fought at Preston on his professional début in May 1935. By the end of the second half of the thirties, Reid had gained a reputation as a good fighter, but his career was put on hold while he served in World War II, spending time in a Japanese prisoner-of-war camp. Reid fought as a lightweight for a while after the War, and carried on fighting for three decades until he retired in the 1960s and ran his own gymnasium. Joe’s younger brother Jim was also an amateur and then professional wrestler, but not as successful, or with such longevity as Joe.

In 1904 he took up an appointment at Woodford College and became captain of Woodford Town. He joined West Ham United midway through the 1905-06 season, where he spent two and a half seasons and scored a total of 41 goals in 75 league and cup matches. In 1908 Stapley accepted an invitation to join Glossop where their patron, Sir Samuel Hillwood, Bt., was spending considerable sums of money in an effort to revive the ailing Derbyshire Club. Stapley’s brother Will, who won amateur international honors as a centre-half, also went to Glossop but it was Harry who immediately became the favorite of the crowd as he continued to show the same high scoring capabilities which had been the feature of his game at West ham. With 67 goals in 135 appearances he was Glossop’s leading scorer each season from 1908 to 1912. Although he won 12 amateur caps he was never selected for a full international despite the fact that during his four seasons as Glossop’s leading scorer, England called on eight different centre-forwards. Further proof of his scoring ability came at the 1908 Olympics when he scored all four goals in Britain’s second round win over Holland and, with a total of six goals, was Britain’s leading scorer in the Olympic tournament. However, Stapley’s main duties at Glossop were as private tutor and personal football and cricket coach to the sons of Sir Samuel Hillwood. Stapley was clearly particular successful as a cricket coach as the sound grounding he gave them, later polished by George Hirst at Eton, resulted in all three of the boys winning cricket blues at Oxford or Cambridge. As the years passed, Stapley was increasingly taken into Sir Samuel’s confidence and served as a private secretary after his election as the Member of Parliament for the High Peak constituency. He also served as his employer’s nominee on the Board of Directors of various local companies. Henry Stapley died on his 54th birthday.",

He competed at his first Olympics at age 19 in Seoul. In 1991, he captured his first major title, winning the World Championships in Kraków (Poland) while also earning a team bronze. This built up Olympic expectations as well, but Fairweather couldn’t deliver in either Barcelona or Atlanta, his best result being a fourth place in the 1996 team event. With a coach from South Korea (the top archery nation), Fairweather gave it another try at his home Olympics in Sydney, and succeeded. His gold medal was Australia’s first Olympic medal in the sport. Retiring after his gold medal, he made a comeback to compete in the Athens Olympics, but without making an impact. After stepping away from competition Fairweather was appointed national team coach in 2009, but retired just two years later. Fairweather, who was educated as a jewelry designer, is married to Jackie Gallagher, winner of the 1996 triathlon world title.","Brother of Kate Fairweather Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the World Archery Championships (1–0–1 1991 Kraków gold: Recurve individual, bronze: Recurve team) Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the World Indoor Archery Championships (1–0–0 1999 La Habana gold: Recurve team)"

At the time of the 1932 Olympics she was a well-known artist already. She combined strictly expressionist elements with Art Deco. Many of her works were animal figures, mostly horses and dogs, for which she preferred drypoint etchings. In 1932 Mittell Weber submitted two paintings and seven etchings. The etching Four-in-Hand and Coach (28 x 40 cm), may well be a study for the painting of the same title. There is a whole series of Polo motifs from the 1930s. Probably only Polo I was created before 1932. Quite probably at least the etching Taking the Jump (20 x 30 cm) one of the works entered in 1932. In 1936 Mittell Weber presented the work Racing. There is no picture of Racing, but the print from 1935 (25.4 x 35.6 cm, sheet 28.4 x 40.6 cm) is included in the inventory of the Metropolitan Museum in New York. In 1940, the artist had donated it to the museum. There, the work was part of an exhibition of contemporary American art by the Artists for Victory in 1942. It probably depicted not a horse race, but rather a dog race, as dogs were among her favorite motifs.",

Büeler first worked as an assistant for hydraulic engineering for the ETH, and then as a site manager for road and bridge construction. In 1938 Büeler travelled to Argentina where he would end up living until 1947.

Arguably Büeler’s finest achievement was the construction of the first artificial ice rink in South America, which he built, managed, and operated in Buenos Aires. Büeler returned to Switzerland and worked for an energy company in Lausanne where he worked on projects to construct two power plants. Büeler was then elected as the city engineer of Solothurn in 1950. During this period multiple roads and sewer systems were constructed.

A year earlier, Visser had been close to winning Olympic gold, when Tomas Gustafson beat Visser’s leading time only with a fabulous final lap. Visser, who left Calgary with a silver and a bronze medal vowed to return in Albertville for a gold medal. After 1989, Visser spent time on his education, training to become a commercial pilot. At the 1992 Games, Visser won an unexpected medal in the 5000 m, but he had set his sights on the 1500 m. Again, he was narrowly defeated, with Koss beating him by 0.09 seconds. Immensely disappointed with the result of his last race, Visser gave away his skates by throwing them into the audience. Apart from these prizes, Visser won three more medals at European Championships and was runner-up at the World Championships in 1988. In Dutch Championships, he took the allround title in 1988, 1989 and 1991, and won four distance titles. Visser also won five World Cup races (all in 5000 m) and finished second in the 5k/10k season rankings in 1991. In 1987, Leo Visser set two new World Records (3000 m and 5000 m).

In 1930, he clinched his first national title and was named “King of pole vaulting” at only 17 years of age. This earned him a place on the Chinese team for the 1930 Far Eastern Games. In the following year, Fu set his first national record with 3.54 m. After the Mukden-Incident, he moved to Shanghai, because his home region became part of the Japanese controlled state of Manchukuo. There, he worked for a publisher and bookstore. Before World War II, national championships were only held randomly and Fu won the pole vault on the next two occasions in 1933 and 1935, breaking his own national record both times. In 1934, he competed at the Far Eastern Games in Manila and took second place, one of the first Chinese medals on an international level. Fu also placed first in the trials for the 1936 Berlin Olympics, setting a national record with a jump of 4.15 m, still using the old bamboo poles. At the Olympics, he had to borrow a pole from his Japanese contestants, however, he was one of the few Chinese athletes to qualify for the final round. Due to his good looks, in 1934 Fu was cast for a part in the movie “Sea Burial” about the hardship of fishermen, appearing in the first of several movies. After the Olympics, he enrolled in the foreign language department of the Jinan-Universität in Shanghai. When his parents tried to persuade him to return to Manchuria (now Manchukuo), he decided to join the Chinese air force.

84288,Peter Boumphrey,Male,10 April 1919,,, Great Britain,GBR,"Downhill skiier and former Army officer, Peter Boumphrey had a vision to build a purpose-built ski resort in southern France in 1965. He found an area of land close to the Italian border, and also close enough to Nice airport to enable British skiiers to enjoy the sport in the winter without fear of not having enough snow. After lengthy negotiations, the resort of Isola 2000 was opened in time for the 1971 winter season. Boumphrey, who has one of the pistes at Isola named after him, had been skiing since the age of three, when he went on a family holiday to Switzerland. By complete contrast, he was also an excellent trumpeter, and to earn spare cash in the summer of 1937 he toured cafés in Paris and Budapest, playing with various dance bands. Back on the slopes in 1938, aged just 19, he finished second to Jimmy Palmer-Tomkinson in the Arthur Lunn Trophy (slalom) at Wengen, which resulted in him being chosen as a reserve for the British team at that year’s World Championship at Engelberg. However, Duncan Kessler could not compete in the Worlds, and Boumphrey got his chance, finishing 28th in the slalom. The war years then intervened and in 1948 Boumphrey was a member of the British Olympic team at St. Moritz, when he skiied in specially adapted tinted contact lenses that had been made for him.",Husband of Rosemarie Sparrow

118011,Zac Purchase,Male,2 May 1986,184.0,73, Great Britain,GBR,"A keen sportsman, Zac Purchase started rowing in 1997 while at King’s College, Worcester, and came to prominence when he was World Under-23 lightweight single sculls champion in 2005. By the end of the year he had added a silver medal in the senior World Championships and established himself as an up-and-coming talent. This talent was revealed conclusively in front of a home crowd at the 2006 World Championships when he rowed away from his rivals to record an easy victory. Since the lightweight single sculls is not an Olympic event British coaches had to search for someone to partner Purchase when to he moved to the doubles and found him in the form of Mark Hunter. The pair were never off the podium in their first season together and won a bronze at their first World Championships in 2007 but this was nothing compared to 2008. Purchase and Hunter won all three races of the World Cup series to arrive at the Olympics as overwhelming favourites and backed this up in Beijing to win Olympic gold. After a year away from the sport the pair returned in 2010 and has won both the 2010 and 2011 World Championships. They were under pressure to win their second Olympic gold medal in 2012 and just when they looked to have victory in sight, saw it snatched away from them on the line by the winning Danish pair. The month after the Olympics, Purchase married his long-time girlfriend, and fellow rower, Felicity “Fliss” Hill in St. Paul’s Cathedral. He then took 18 months away from the sport before returning in 2014 with the intention of joining the heavyweight squad but that proved fruitless and he announced his retirement soon afterwards. An excellent saxophonist, Purchase performed live on television at the 2008 BBC Sports Personality of the Year Awards ceremony.",
