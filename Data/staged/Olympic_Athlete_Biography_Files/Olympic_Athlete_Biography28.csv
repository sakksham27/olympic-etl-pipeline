Bruce was the son of the first Lord Aberdare and one-time Member of Parliament and minister in William Gladstone’s first Cabinet. Bruce Jr., or Charlie as he was known to his friends, learned his early climbing skills on the peaks of Snowdonia in Wales. He devoted a lifetime to the Army and mountaineering, and his knowledge of Himalayan peaks was second-to-none, thanks to his role serving with the 1/5th Gurkhas battalion of the Indian Army for 20 years. During World War I Bruce served with the Gurkhas in Egypt and Gallipoli, where he suffered severe leg injuries and was hospitalised for 10 months. Having been awarded with the Member of the Royal Victorian Order (MVO) in 1903, he was made a Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB) in 1918. He served with his brigade for the last time in the Afghan War in 1919 before retiring and taking up a post as secretary to the Glamorganshire Territorial Association. In 1921, permission was granted for Bruce to assemble a team for an assault on Everest the following year, and they got to within 1,800 feet (549m) of the summit before abandoning the climb. Bruce celebrated his 56th birthday on Everest during the expedition. Bruce was leader of a second Everest expedition in 1924, but on his way to base camp suffered an attack of malaria and handed over command to Colonel Edward Norton. Bruce was elected president of the Alpine Club in 1924 and was noted for writing several books about his exploits on the Himalayas, where he was known as “The Great Sahib”.","Cousin of Geoffrey Bruce Uncle of Clarence, Lord Aberdare of Duffryn"

19449,Jack Simonian,Male,15 December 1935,172.0,70, Kenya,KEN,"Jack Simonian played hockey for Kenya at the 1960, 1964 and 1968 Olympics. He was named goalkeeper of the tournament in 1968 at Mexico City, but hockey is not the sport for which he is best remembered in Kenya. Simonian was considered a legendary Safari Rally driver in his native land. He competed in rally races during his hockey career. Simonian attended St. Mary’s School where he played both hockey and tennis. His long-time career was as an aeronautic engineer with East African Airways. Simonian did his national service with the Kenyan Regiment beginning in 1955. After leaving the Army, Simonian joined Parklands Sports Club in Nairobi and played hockey in the Kenya European Sports Hockey Association League. With Parklands he won the Craig Cup in 1960 against Nakuru Athletic Club, and represented Parklands at hockey, tennis and snooker. In 1962 Simonian moved to Silk Union Nairobi and played with them for a decade, helping them win multiple titles, including the M. R. D’Souza Gold Cup, Laton Brothers Cup, Asian Sports Association Cup, Golden Jubilee Kenya Cup, Desmesh Cup, Ujjager Singh Cup, Kishen Singh Cup, Joseph and Sons Shield, Karam Singh/Hira Singh Cup, and the Nairobi League Championship. Simonian was born in the Sudan, but his parents were Armenian nationals who settled in Egypt and then moved to Sudan. They emigrated to Kenya in 1948, and Jack Simonian lived in Kenya until his later years when he settled in England. He died in Australia while on holiday there celebrating his 84th birthday.",
923518,Marcello Fiasconaro,Male,19 July 1949,185.0,78, Italy,ITA,"Italian-South African distance runner Marcello Fiasconaro was the outstanding Italian athlete at the beginning of the 1970s. He was born to a Belgian mother and a Sicilian father who was taken prisoner during World War II. Following his release the family settled in Cape Town, where Marcello was born. His father became director of the Cape Town Opera House. Marcello’s first sporting experience was with rugby before he switched to athletics in 1970. He immediately achieved surprising results in the 400m (46.5) and 800m. In 1971, on the recommendation of Carmelo Rado, a discus thrower who had emigrated to South Africa, he was contacted by the Italian Athletics Federation and invited to compete in Italy where he settled. Coached by Stewart Banner, Fiasconaro broke the Italian 400m record twice in July 1971 and started as one of the favourites for the European Championships at Helsinki but finished second the young Scot David Jenkins by just 0.04. Fiasconaro then ran a memorable last leg in the 4x400 relay final to win the bronze medal. Having set the world record for the 400m indoors at the beginning of 1972, Fiasconaro was forced to withdraw from the München Olympics due to problems with his foot, the result of an old tibia fracture while playing rugby. The following year he moved up to 800m and it would be a decision he would not regret. Fiasconaro enjoyed some great battles with the best middle-distance runners in the world, and on 27 June 1973, in Milano, during the Italy-Czechoslovakia match, he led the race from start to finish and wrote his name into Italian athletics history by breaking the world record with 1:43.7, a time that would only be improved three years later by the legendary Alberto Juantorena in the Montréal Olympic final. With recurring foot pain, at the 1974 Roma European Championships, Fiasconaro only finished sixth. The end of an era for this outstanding Italian athlete was in sight, and practically ended that day on the track of the Olympic stadium. After his athletic days, Fiasconaro was for over twenty years a representative of Adidas, then became a partner in the company distributing their products to the United States. Because he was Cape Town-born, Fiasconaro experienced years of apartheid and all the social tensions that plagued South Africa.",

Kernoff also painted typical Irish landscapes and portraits of members of Dublin’s literature and theater scene.

In 1972 she was approached about attending school in the United States, and eventually earned a track scholarship to Chicago State University. At Chicago State she moved up in distance and would later win a silver medal in the 800 metres at the 1974 Commonwealth Games. Not used to the cold Chicago winters, she later transferred to a school in New Mexico. Returning to Kenya after receiving her degree, Chemabwai joined Rift Valley Institute of Technology as a trainer, later coaching legendary distance runner, Tegla Leroupe. Chemabwai also studied at Mosoriot Teacher’s Training College and then joined Moi University in 1987, teaching sports and physical education. Chemabwai was married to Kenyan Olympic gold medalist Julius Sang. After his early death in 2004, in 2018 she started the Chemabwai-Sang Educational Centre in Eldoret, a talent identification centre, teaching and training as many as 300 students.

He was raised by his grandfather Beppe Croce, after whom he was named, after his father Luigi had died in 1918 of a disease contracted while serving as an Army Officer in Trieste during World War I. Beppe’s grandfather was the founder of the Italian Tennis Federation, leading that group from 1913-29. He also presided over the Tennis Club Genova from 1913-29. In 1939 Croce won the Italian University Star Class championship and later served as an officer during World War II. After the September 1943 armistice he remained faithful to King Vittorio Emanuele III and fought the Nazis as a liberal partisan and after the war, from 1946-80, Beppe became President of Lloyd Adriatico, the insurance company founded by his grandfather. In 1948 Croce competed at the Olympic Games in the 6 metres Class, placing eighth, and in 1952, together with his French friend Renè Levainville, he founded the famous Giraglia Cup, a regatta between St. Tropez and Genova organized by the Yacht Club Italiano in collaboration with the Yacht Club de France, which nowadays involves hundreds of sailors and maxi-yachts. Croce also played an important role in the organization of the 1982 Azzurra America’s Cup Challenge, the first Italian attempt to win the Cup, financed by his friend and FIAT president Gianni Agnelli, with the help of the Olympian Karim, Prince Aga Khan. From 1969 to his death in 1986 Beppe Croce was the first non-British President of the International Sailing Federation (ISAF), was President of the Italian Federation from 1957-81, and Vice-President of the Italian Olympic Committee 1973-78. His son, Carlo Croce, (twice an Olympian) followed in his father’s footsteps as President of World Sailing (former ISAF) from 2013-16 and the Italian Federation from 2013-16. Beppe Croce passed away at 72-years-old. A memorial celebration was held at London’s Westminster Cathedral attended by, among others, an emissary of HRH Prince Philip (Sir Owen Aisher), King Olaf V of Norway, and Prince Aga Khan IV. In memory of him, since 1989 World Sailing has presented the annual Beppe Croce Trophy. The roll of honor includes multiple Olympic medalists and all have dedicated an outstanding amount of time to the sport of sailing. During his life Croce assembled an important collection of Yacht Portrait Paintings from 1800 and they were in his house of Portofino, a small town near Genova. Some years ago his family gifted about 100 paintings to the Galata Museo del Mare now on show permanently at the Beppe Croce Gallery.",Father of Carlo Croce Father of Luigi Croce Listed in Olympians and IOC Members Serving as President of an International Federation (IF) (ISAF (IYRU) president 1969-1986) Listed in Olympic Order Recipients (1984 (Silver*))

A third consecutive German Gymnastics title came in 1909, which meant he had to retire from the event as a competitor, but he continued as a judge for several years. Potts won the 1910 and 1911 Metropolitan and Southern Counties Championship, and in 1912 won the coveted English title when he beat Len Hanson into second place by just 3½ points, despite being outscored by Hanson on three of the four pieces of apparatus. Potts was trained at the Northampton Polytechnic Institute (NPI) by Rudolf Oberholzer, father of Henry. Potts’ younger half-brother Reginald was also English champion, in 1914. Another half-brother, Henry, was a gymnastics and wrestling judge at the 1908 London Olympics, and was also an honorary secretary and judge for the Amateur Wrestling Association between 1908-12. He also won the high jump competition at the Inter-Polytechnic Championships. Edward and Reginald were bronze medal winners with the Great Britain team gymnastics at the 1912 Stockholm Olympics, and Edward was captain of the NPI team that beat Birmingham City to win their first ever Adams Shield as national team champions that same year. Potts did not defend his national individual title in 1913 because business commitments kept him away from his London base a great deal, but he did return to the NPI team to help them retain the Adams Shield. Potts served on the executive committee of the Amateur Gymnastic Association. By profession, he ran his own glass merchant’s business, E. W. Potts & Co. Ltd.",Half-brother of Reginald Potts

After the war, however, Germans were not concerned with building new boats, so he moved to Switzerland, where he started competitive sailing in 5.5 metre yachts, mainly on Swiss lakes and the Mediterranean Sea. In 1960 Baars-Lindner sailed the 5.5m yacht “Bronia” together with Herbert Scholl and Karl-August Stolze for the Unified German Olympic team. After 10 years of intensive racing he returned to his home province of Schleswig-Holstein, and settled there with his wife and three daughters. By then Baars-Lindner had received his master’s certificate, and started working at the Vertens ship yard. He ran his own boat building and repair business under the name of Baars-Lindner + Renkhoff in the town of Schleswig, close to the Baltic coast, where he also joined the Schlei-Segel-Club and continued to sail his 60 m² yacht “Irene” for more than 50 years.

There, Bruno worked as a self-employed architect in the 1920s and 1930s. He mainly built war memorials and cemeteries but also barracks and churches. Under Roderich Fick he was involved in the planning of the new buildings in the “Führer City of Linz”. After World War II, he dedicated himself to rebuilding the bombed city of München. The ski lodge of the Academic Ski Club München was built in 1929 as the “Grünseehütte” on Lake Schliersee in accordance with Biehler’s plans, who himself was a member of the club.

921569,Paul Manship,Male,24 December 1885,,, United States,USA,"American Paul Howard was the father of American sculptor John Paul Manship (1927-2000). Paul Howard was one of the first artists to be aware of art history. Because of his color blindness, he had to give up his original plan to become a painter. He received his education in St. Paul at the Art Students League of New York, and the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts in Philadelphia. He was particularly impressed by the Egyptian, Assyrian and pre-classical Greek sculptures with which he had become acquainted during a travel grant to the Mediterranean in 1909-12. With his mythological and animal representations, Manship is regarded as one of the main precursors of the Art Deco. Manship also produced a variety of coins and medals. Manship produced statues and busts of prominent persons such as Theodore Roosevelt, Samuel Osgood, John D. Rockefeller, Robert Frost, Gifford Beal and Henry L. Stimson. One of his other fields was to create monuments following both the two World Wars. The 1926 sculpture entered in 1928 is originally titled Indian Hunter and His Dog. At the art competitions a plaster model was exhibited. The original was a commission for a life-size fountain in a park in his hometown of St. Paul. In the meantime, the sculpture has returned to its original location in Cochran Park. The group was later cast in different sizes. For instance, the bronze donated to the Smithsonian American Art Museum by the artist measures 59 × 60 × 18 cm. The fact that the sculpture was exhibited in the stadium in Amsterdam and not in the museum suggests that it was a larger version. It can be assumed that the Indian Runner submitted in 1932 is the same sculpture, possibly in a different size and / or as a bronze, and was therefore only shown “hors concours”. The same applies to Manship’s sculpture Atalanta. The approximately 73 cm tall bronze figure dates back to 1921 and was therefore not eligible for the competition. Atalanta was a fast female runner in Greek mythology.",

He missed the Munich Olympics but returned to the Olympic arena in 1976 although without any great success. The only global championship of his career came at the 1978 World Championship in the prone event but any hopes of an Olympic medal in Moscow were ended when shooting became one of the few British sports federations to join the boycott of the 1980 Olympics. Allan set a world record for the prone shoot in 1982 but success in this discipline always eluded him at the Olympic Games. Instead he won his first Olympic medal in Los Angeles in the three position shoot, an event that he had only taken seriously since the late 70s. Four years later in Seoul he led the qualifying rounds but was beaten to the gold by his fellow Briton [Malcolm Cooper] with whom he had friendly rivalry for many years. Allan’s international career lasted a quarter of a century and included eight medals (including three golds) at the Commonwealth Games between 1974-94. He spent most of his working life as a physical training instructor with the Royal Air Force but after retirement he took up a coaching position with the New Zealand rifle team. He was an inaugural inductee into the Scottish Sports Hall of Fame.","Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the British Empire/Commonwealth Games (3–3–4 1974 Christchurch SHO bronze: 50 m small-bore rifle prone (competed for Scotland); 1978 Edmonton SHO gold: 50 m small-bore rifle prone (competed for Scotland); 1982 Brisbane SHO gold: 50 m small-bore rifle 3 positions and 10 m air rifle/pairs, bronze: 50 m small-bore rifle 3 positions/pairs (competed for Scotland); 1986 Edinburgh SHO silver: 50 m small-bore rifle prone and 50 m small-bore rifle 3 positions, bronze: 50 m small-bore rifle 3 positions/pairs (competed for Scotland); 1994 Victoria SHO silver: 50 m small-bore rifle 3 positions/pairs, bronze: 50 m small-bore rifle 3 positions (competed for Scotland)) Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the World Shooting Championships (2–1–1 1978 Seoul gold: 50 m small-bore prone; 1982 Caracas gold: 50 m small-bore rifle keeling team, silver: 50 m small-bore rifle 3 positions team, bronze: 50 m small-bore rifle standing team)"

McNeir was knocked unconscious and was disabled for weeks with scalp wounds and burns on his hands and face. McNeir went on to become one of the greatest American trapshooters ever, recording the third-high score on the 1920 Olympic trapshooting team.

However, she developed into a top-flight singles player best known for her failures and triumphs at Wimbledon, perfectly exemplifying the words from the Kipling poem that are emblazoned above the All-England Club’s entrance to Centre Court, “If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster, And treat those two impostors just the same.” Novotná reached four Grand Slam singles finals. She lost the final of the 1991 Australian Open to Monica Seles in three sets. In 1993 Novotná reached the Wimbledon final where she faced Steffi Graf. The match went into the third set, which Novotná led 4-1, and had a game point on serve for 5-1, but the pressure overcame her, and Graf won that game and then won the final five games, to win the set, the match, and the tournament. At the victory ceremony, when Novotná was given her runner-up trophy by the Duchess of Kent, she famously cried on the Duchess’s shoulder. Novotná returned to the Wimbledon final in 1997, but lost again in three sets, that time to Martina Hingis. In 1998, Novotná finally overcame her demons on Centre Court, winning Wimbledon by defeating Nathalie Tauziat in straight sets, in one of the most popular Wimbledon victories ever. She received her trophy, the Venus Rosewater Dish, from the Duchess of Kent. Novotná was the oldest woman in the Open Era to win her first Grand Slam title. Novotná won 24 professional singles titles in her career but the 1998 Wimbledon was her only Grand Slam, although she did win the 1997 Tour Final. In doubles, she won 12 Grand Slams, and added four Grand Slam titles in mixed doubles. In all, she won 76 doubles titles. She achieved a career best singles rank of #2 in 1997 and had a best doubles rank of #1. Novotná settled in Florida, doing some tennis commentary on television, until returning to her hometown of Brno in the Czech Republic, eventually building a home in the small neighboring village of Omice, where she lived with her partner. She died very young, at age 49, after a long battle with cancer, which she fought very privately. She was the first women’s Grand Slam champion of the Open Era to pass away.",

In 1980 he won the World, European and Olympic titles. He would almost certainly have defended the Olympic title in 1984 had the Soviets not boycotted the Olympics. In 1984 Taranenko won the Friendship Games in Varna, Bulgaria with lifts that would have won the Olympic gold medal by 52.5 kg, breaking the world record. In 1985 Taranenko moved up to the super-heavyweight class and became the main favorite for the 1988 Olympic gold in that category, but he was injured and did not compete at Seoul, although he won the European title before the Olympics. In 1990 Taranenko won the super-heavyweight World Championship and was European Champion in 1991 and 1996. He also won the Olympic super-heavyweight silver in 1992, the World Championships heavyweight bronze in 1979, super-heavyweight silver in 1987, European Championships super-heavyweight silvers in 1985 and 1986, and bronze in 1990. Domestically, Taranenko won the Soviet heavyweight titles in 1979 and 1983 and the super-heavyweight title in 1987, while taking heavyweight bronze in 1977 and super-heavyweight bronze in 1989. He also won the Soviet heavyweight Cups in 1981 and 1982 and super-heavyweight cup in 1986. During his career Taranenko set 21 heavyweight world records (10 in snatch, three in clean & jerk and eight in total) and five super-heavyweight world records (two in clean & jerk and three in total). His last world records, set in November 1988 in Canberra, Australia, 266.0 kg in clean & jerk and 475.0 kg in total, are still the most weight a man has ever lifted (as of 2012), although they are no longer world records as the IWF changed the weight classes in 1992, thus erasing all previous world records. Taranenko retired from weightlifting after he failed to qualify for the 1996 Olympics and began working as a weightlifting coach, serving as head coach of the Indian national weightlifting team.",

In 1942 he was seconded to the Swedish legation in Washington, DC with the rank of colonel. In this capacity he visited camps of Japanese internees, notably in Hawai’i.

He closely co-operated with Italian writer Gabriele D’Annunzio. Together with his brother Jacques (1879-?), author and historian, Boulenger regarded himself a typical “Dandy” in France. In 1921, he wrote Les aventures d’un dandy (Adventures of a Dandy). The title of his 1912 Olympic entry is not known; probably it was one of his works about fencing like Quarante escrimeurs (Forty Fencers) from 1903. In 1924, he was a member of the jury for literature at the Olympic art competitions.

He was also part of the quartet that won the national 4x100 metres relay title on seven occasions (1903–04, 1907–09, 1911–12). In 1906 Lindberg twice improved the world record in the 100 metres with his Swedish record standing until 1936.

Two years later Lindberg competed at the 1908 London Olympics but his national achievements did not translate to Olympic success. In the 100 metres, 200 metres, and the 1,600 metres medley relay he was eliminated in the heats in each event, and failed to make the final of the javelin throw. Four years later Lindberg’s fortunes improved when he won silver in the 4 × 100 metres relay at the 1912 Stockholm Olympics and reached the semi-finals in both the 100 and 200 metres. As a footballer Lindberg played for Örgryte IS and won five Swedish Championship titles with the club (1902, 1904–07).

Olin wanted to continue but Stecher declined to return to the ring and Olin was awarded the bout by the referee.

No official announcement was made and Olin was not considered as World Champion, although later, on 2 May 1917, when Olin lost a match to Ed “Strangler” Lewis due to his own shoulder injury, Lewis and most of the public considered Lewis as the World Champion.

He won his debut by knockout and went to became five times amateur champion of Denmark, win 104 of his 111 amateur bouts and win bronze medals at both European Championships and Olympic Games. As a professional he equalled Rocky Marciano’s heavyweight division record of 49 successive wins, a streak that included the winning of the lightly regarded International Boxing Organization heavyweight championship and victories over former world heavyweight champions Larry Holmes, Tim Witherspoon and Tony Tubbs. In his 50th fight he was knocked out in the final round by American Dicky Ryan and was hospitalized due to severe dehydration. Rebounding from this setback he went on another run of victories which included revenge over Ryan and the annexation of another minor title, the International Boxing Council heavyweight crown. He lost in seven rounds to Mike Tyson in 2001 before his home crowd in Copenhagen. After two victories he retired, leaving the ring with a record of sixty-two wins and two defeats.

Author Oscar Wilde, who lived in Chicago, became a supporter of Donoghue’s work after Donoghue’s return to the city in 1881. This in turn attracted a patron whose financial backing allowed Donoghue to work in Paris and Rome for some years. After that, he mainly created architectural sculptures. It was in Rome in the 1890s that he molded his gigantic sculpture “The Spirit Brooding over the Abyss”. The work was intended to be presented at the World’s Columbian Exposition in Chicago, but never got there and eventually the separate pieces got lost or were destroyed on the way.

Her second dive was the best of the entire round and she outscored the eventual gold medallist Pat McCormick, and at one stage was lying in third place. Just a month after the Games Spencer finished third in at the ASA National Platform Diving Championship at Blackpool, behind Ann Long and Valerie Lloyd-Chandos.

921643," Rebori, Wentworth & Dewey",Male,,,, United States,USA,"Rebori, Wentworth & Dewey was an architectural office situated in Chicago. Together with McCormick, they built several office buildings, hotels and sports clubs in the Chicago school style. Andrew Nicholas Rebori (1886-1966) was of Italian descent and first worked in the New York architectural office of Charles Alling Gifford when he was 15-years-old. In 1909, he moved to Chicago as a professor of architecture, and in 1922, he founded his own office together with Wentworth, Dewey and McCormick for 10 years. After dissolution, he worked in private practice. John Wentworth (1892-1958) and Albert Bromfield Dewey Jr. (correctly Albert Bromfield Dewey II, 1892-1967) both came from distinguished families. Wentworth was a descendent of former Chicago mayor “Long John” Wentworth. He was educated at Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). An avid aviator, he served in the Air Force in World War I and designed the well-known hat-in-the-ring emblem of the 94th Fighter Squadron. Wentworth married the daughter of Charles Arthur Tilt, founder and owner of the Diamond T Motor Car Company. Albert Bromfield Dewey, Jr. was the son of a Chicago banker and real estate developer. His brother Charles S. Dewey was a congressman from Illinois 1941-1945. Educated at Yale University, Albert served in the U. S. Navy Air Force in World War I. He lived and worked in Chicago and Washington, D.C. The Racquet Club Chicago was originally planned to be built on a property owned by Dewey in the Queen Anne style. When the possibility of an enlargement occurred, Rebori redesigned it in the style of the Doge’s Palace in Venice. The opening took place in 1924. As a social and sports club, the club still exists today and the building is listed in the National Register of the Gold Coast Historic District.",

575,William Dod,Male,18 July 1867,,, Great Britain,GBR,"Willy Dod was a descendant of Sir Antony Dod of Edge, who commanded the English archers at Agincourt, so it was appropriate that he celebrated his 41st birthday by winning an Olympic gold medial for archery. The archers at the 1908 Olympic Games completed in atrocious weather conditions, and at one state the driving rain brought proceedings to a halt. At the end of the first day, Willy Dod of Welford Park led Reginald Brooks-King of West Somerset by 10 points. Although the weather conditions improved on the second day, eddies of wind around the stadium still provided a stern test and Dod was one of the few to master the difficult conditions. He finished the winner by the handsome margin of 47 points. Dod was never inconvenienced by having to attend school or work for a living. He received his education entirely from private tutors, and his father, a wealthy banker and cotton broker, provided sufficient funds for him to lead a life of leisure. In addition to being a champion golfer and archer, Willy was also a fine shot and enjoyed big game hunting in the Rockies. He first took up archery as a pastime at the home of the Legh family, who had an estate close to the Dods in Cheshire and were one of the greatest names in the history of the sport. Neither Willy nor his legendary younger sister Lottie Dod entered for any archery competition until 1906, when the family moved sound to Newbury in Berkshire and Willy and his sister joined the newly-formed Welford Park Archers. Within three years of his first competition, Willy Dod was the Olympic champion and he went on to win the Grand National Archery title, which was the British Championship, in 1909 and 1911. After the fashionable Welford Park club was wound up in 1911, the Dod family quickly lost interest in the sport; in fact, the 1911 Grand National meeting was Willy’s last Open archery competition. Having previously been a scratch golfer at the Royal Liverpool gold Club and the South of Ireland champion in 1901, he again devoted time to the sport and in 1912 he reached the fourth round of the British amateur Championship. Four weeks after the outbreak of war, Willy enlisted in the Sportsman’s Battalion of the Royal Fusiliers and by the end of the year he was serving as a private in the trenches of France. For a 47-year-old from Dod’s social background this was a particularly chastening experience and he applied for a transfer to the Navy. Surprisingly, his request was granted and he was commissioned into the RNVR in April 1915, but after spending a year back in France as an administrative officer with the Royal Naval Air Service he was invalided out. Willy and his sister eventually settled in Devon, where they had bought a property at Westward Ho! Just before the Second World War. Their lives centered around the golf club and in 1948 Willy was elected President of the Royal North Devon Club; the following year Lottie was elected the Lady President. In 1950 Lottie returned to London and Willy joined her in her Earl’s Court flat two years later; neither ever married and they spent their last years together.",Brother of Lottie Dod

He attended Aldenham Public School where he excelled at sports. At 17 he went to work in Ireland for a textile firm. At first he played rugby for the City of Derry team but was noted for his kicking skills by the chairman of the newly-formed Derry City football team. In 1929, Shearer joined Casuals FC and in 1930 also started playing for Corinthians FC. In 1931-32 he started the season by scoring six goals in three games for Casuals FC before returning to Ireland and featuring for Derry City. During the 1933-34 and 1935-36 seasons, Shearer appeared in the important Casuals games in the FA Amateur Cup and succeeded in helping Casuals lift the trophy for the only time in their history in 1936, scoring one goal in the final replay against Ilford. Due to this game, Shearer missed the Irish Cup final with Derry City. For Corinthians and Casuals, Shearer appeared until the 1938-39 season in 50 official games scoring 38 goals, whilst regularly featuring on tour in Ireland, Germany, Denmark and Switzerland. Shearer played for Derry until 1939, scoring 78 goals including three hat-tricks in one season, in 1936-37 helping them to lift the City Cup and North West Senior Cup. In 1934 he also helped his old school to victory in the Arthur Dunn Cup final for the first time. He became a favorite with the Irish crowds and was a key player in the Irish league team which defeated the Football League in 1935 as well as in 1936. He also gained seven Amateur International caps for England and was selected for the British Olympic side in 1936. He made one appearance as inside right against Poland scoring one goal and was a substitute against China. During his career he received a number of offers to turn professional, including one from Arsenal, but always refused. He retired from football in 1939 although he did play occasionally for the Army during World War II. He was perhaps an even more accomplished cricketer than he was a footballer. Shearer played cricket for the City of Derry, where he won the North West Cup, and the Bond Cup (1927-28) for the highest batting average. In the 1929 season, Shearer scored 2,000 runs. A right-hand batter, he played 13 times for Ireland between 1933 and 1952 and in 1951, playing for the Gentlemen of Ireland, he scored 101 to become the first Irish player to score a century at Lord’s Cricket Ground, the most prestigious cricket venue. During the war he served in North Africa with the Royal Artillery and commanded the garrison at Tobruk in Libya. He was demobilized as a Colonel and was awarded an OBE at the end of the war. In business life he became managing director of a long-established Belfast textile firm and later became a director of the construction company Sir Alfred McAlpine & Son. On his retirement, Shearer became the first chairman of the Northern Ireland Sports Council and was president of the Irish and Northern Cricket Unions. He was appointed honorary aide-de-camp to the Governor of Northern Ireland in 1950 and from 1960-69 to the Queen. He was appointed CBE in 1974 for his services to Northern Ireland.",

His book Dirk III, taken from the name of his yacht, is subtitled “Images and thoughts from the world of yacht cruising.” It was first published in 1934 and reprinted in 1999 and has also been translated into English.

He earned his first international medal, bronze in the heavyweight division, at the 1980 United States Open, but was unable to participate in that year’s Summer Olympics, as Canada was among the nations that boycotted the Games. He also won his first national title that year and defended it in 1981, the same year that he came in seventh at the World Championships and won a gold medal at the Maccabiah Games. In 1982 he lost the Canadian title to Fred Blaney, but regained it in 1983 and won gold at that year’s Pan American Games, in addition to coming in fifth at the World Championships and being named Manitoba’s Male Athlete of the Year. He defended his national crown in 1984 and was finally afforded the opportunity to attend the Olympic Games. In the heavyweight tournament, he had the misfortune of being drawn against upcoming gold medalist Hitoshi Saito of Japan and was easily dispatched. He fought hard in the repêchage, however, defeating Isidore Silas of Cameroon and Radomir Kovačević of Yugoslavia to win the bronze medal. Although he lost his Canadian title in 1985, Berger remained successful in the late 1980s and won gold at that year’s Maccabiah Games. He regained his national crown in 1986 and took silver at that year’s Commonwealth Games behind Elvis Gordon of England. His final international medal, bronze, came at the 1987 United States Open, and the following year he broke his leg and was unable to represent Canada at the 1988 Summer Olympics. After retiring, he took up coaching and founded the West Kildonan Judo Club in Winnipeg. He has been inducted into the Manitoba Sports (1994) and Judo Canada (1996) Halls of Fame.

Budnikov took up the new class and became the Moskva champion in 1960. After improving his physique through gymnastics, athletics, and skiing, he then moved to compete in the Star class.

117576,Andy Murray,Male,15 May 1987,190.0,83, Great Britain,GBR,"From a sporting family, his brother Jamie has a grand slam doubles title to his credit and formed a doubles pairing with Andy in Beijing, whilst his mother won multiple Scottish national tennis titles and his grandfather was a professional footballer. Murray attended Dunblane Primary School and was present when Thomas Hamilton shot dead 17 of his schoolmates in what became known as the “Dunblane Massacre.” Murray first came to notice when he won the under-12 age class at the prestigious Orange Bowl tournament in Miami. At the age of 15 he left Scotland to train in Barcelona and two years later won the Junior US Open title. In 2005 he made his debut on the ATP tour and reached his first tour final in September of that year in Thailand. He won his first tournament in San Diego in 2006, retained this title and also won the St. Petersburg Open in 2007. Murray broke into the world’s top twenty by the end of 2007 and continued to rise in the world rankings throughout 2008. After a disappointing defeat at the 2008 Olympics he rebounded to reach the US Open final and become the first Briton to win back-to-back ATP tour titles in over 30 years. At the 2012 Olympics Murray, in front of his nation’s fans at Wimbledon, defeated Roger Federer in the final for the gold medal. He also won the silver medal in the mixed doubles with Laura Robson. Later that summer he won his first Grand Slam singles title by winning the US Open. In 2013 Murray became the first male Brit to win at Wimbledon since Fred Perry in 1936, and the first British Wimbledon singles champion since Virginia Wade in 1977. In 2015, Murray helped Great Britain to win their first Davis Cup since 1936 and the following year appeared in three Grand Slam finals. He lost to Novak Djokovic in both the final of Australian and French Opens before retaining his Wimbledon title. He followed that by retaining his Olympic title in Rio, to become the first person, male or female, to win consecutive Olympic singles titles. In November 2016, Murray reached the number one spot in the ATP rankings for the first time and, despite a dip in form in 2017, went to the Wimbledon championships still as number one. Murray’s career became in jeopardy when he began experiencing serious hip problems, which eventually resulted in him having a hip replacement in January 2019. He did return to the tennis circuit in June 2019, but with the long time out because of his hip problems, recovery from the hip surgery, and then enforced lay-offs during the COVID-19 pandemic, his results were far less than what he had achieved earlier in his career.",Brother of Jamie Murray Listed in Olympians With Asteroids Named After Them (5441 Andymurray) Listed in Olympian Members of the Nobility (Sir) Listed in Olympic Champions Who Have Played in a Davis Cup Final Winning Team (Olympic Gold - 2012; Davis Cup - 2015)

At the 1896 Olympics, he likely served as a pace maker in some of the track cycling events. In his own events, he won two titles with the German team, but failed to achieve top performances individually. After their return home, most team participants were excluded from the reactionary German Gymnastics Association as they were “involved in a sporting event dedicated to internationalism.” The winning teams were banned from national competitions in Berlin. A Jew, Flatow left Germany for the Netherlands shortly after Hitler’s appointment as chancellor in 1933. Even after the German occupation of his new home country, he went undetected for long. He was eventually captured on New Year’s Eve 1943 and – despite protests of various Dutch and German sports officials (including fellow 1896 Olympian Kurt Doerry) – deported to the Theresienstadt concentration camp. He died there a little more than a year later. Since 1987, the German Gymnastics Federation awards the Flatow Medal, remembering both Alfred and Gustav, to be awarded for excellent all-around performances.",Cousin of Alfred Flatow Listed in Olympians Who Died in Nazi Concentration Camps (Theresienstadt concentration camp) Listed in Olympians Who Were Killed or Missing in Action or Died as a Result of War (†29 January 1945.

106846,Vicki Pendleton,Female,24 September 1980,165.0,60, Great Britain,GBR,"Vicki Pendleton’s grandparents were both keen cyclists, as were her parents. Her father Max raced competitively, and was a former National grass track champion. Vicky and her twin brother both started racing on grass. and at the age of 16 her potential was spotted by Marshall Thomas, the assistant team coach to the national track team. She did not concentrate on cycling completely at that time, but continued her studies at the Northumbria University. She then won the 800 metres national grass title three times 1998-2000 before turning to track racing, and the rest is history as Pendleton went on to become the top female track sprinter of the first decade of the 21st century. She won the world sprint title six times (2005, 2007-10, 2012), two team sprint titles (2007-08) and a keirin title (2007), as well as seven more World Championships medals. She also won the Olympic sprint title at the Beijing 2008 Games, where women’s keirin and team sprint were not on the program. She won the kierin and team sporint gold medals at the 2011 European Track Championships in 2011 and at the London Olympics in 2012 she was the first ever women’s Olympic kierin champion. However, two controversial decisions possibly cost her a chance of further golds, although she did win a silver in the individual sprint. Immediately after her last Olympic race Pendleton announced her retirement from the sport. Her impressive overall medal tally also contained a gold medal from the 2006 Commonwealth Games. She has an exclusive range of Pendleton Cycles on sale in the UK, and her honours include the OBE in 2009 and CBE in 2013. She was also The Sunday Times Sportswoman of the Year and the Sports Journalists’ Association Sportswoman of the Year for 2007. In 2013 she married Scott Gardner, a former sports scientist with the British Cycling coaching team, who she had been linked with romantically during the 2008 Olympics. It cost him his job at the time but he later became Vicki’s personal coach. In 2015, Pendleton switched saddles when she took up horse racing and finished second in her first race at Ripon. She had an impressive first win at Wincanton in March 2016, winning by 29 lengths on Pacha Du Polder. The following month, and barely a year after first sitting on a horse, the pair finished fifth in the Foxhunter Chase at the Cheltenham Gold Cup meeting. At the end of 2016 she made her show jumping début at the London International Horse Show at Olympia, and went clear in her very first ever round. Vicki was once asked what she did for a job and she replied: “I turn left for a living!” referring to the anti-clockwise tracks she raced on.","Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the British Empire/Commonwealth Games (1–1–0 2006 Melbourne CYC gold: sprint, silver: 500 m time trial (competed for England))"

He did so on a remarkable, self-engineered bicycle, with an unusual but very aerodynamic position, with his arms below his chest. As was widely published, the cycle included bearings Obree had taken from a washing machine. Obree lost his record within a week, to fellow Briton Christopher Boardman, who used a carbon-fibre monocoque bicycle. Obree got his revenge on Boardman when he eliminated him in the semi-finals of the World Championships in the individual pursuit, which Obree eventually won. Obree regained the world hour record in 1994, although he lost it to Miguel Induraín later in the year. Obree saw his riding position banned in 1995, but he countered with yet another bicycle, employing the so-called “superman position”, in which the arms were extended forward, again realizing an aerodynamic position. Obree again won the the pursuit title with this new position, although it was also subsequently banned. Obree retired after a failed attempt to become a pro road racer, because he refused to take the doping that he, according to Obree, “would have been forced to take.” Obree later had personal problems and, after divorcing, twice attempted to take his life. In 2011 he came out as gay, and attributed his suicide attempts to his own personal conflicts with his sexual orientation.",

At the 1960 Rome Olympics, the 100 km team time trial began the 1960 Olympic cycling program. Although it started at 0900 hours, the day was already hot, with temperatures reaching 34° C. (93° F.), therefore the teams had to work hard. The East German team consisting of Gustav-Adolf Schur, Erich Hagen, Günter Lörke, and Adler lost Lörke early in the race. Nevertheless the team won the silver medal behind Italy. The race was overshadowed by the death of Knud Enemark Jensen from Denmark, today widely seen as one of the first drug misuse deaths caused by doping substances. In the 1960 Olympic road race, Adler finished 20th. He was never allowed to participate in the well-known road races in the West, so he only had successes in the Friedensfahrt (Peace Race), winning almost five stages between 1958 and 1960, wearing the yellow jersey in three stages. In 1958 and 1959, Adler won two team titles at the national championships.

Most of Gardener’s successes came indoors as an archetypal 60 m specialist and his explosive starts took him in victory in four European Indoor Championships between 2000 and 2007 and gained World Indoor honours in 2004. Although he was AAA 100 m champion on four occasions and became only the second British sprinter to break the ten second barrier, he was not the same force outdoors as he was indoors.

Over the years, the historic estate of the Tasca family in the county of Sclafani was joined by estates in Salina, in Tascante at the foot of Mount Etna, the Whitaker estate on the island of Mozia, and some hectares in Camporeale near Palermo.

He did, however, win the 1976 and 1979 European titles, and collected silver medals in 1974-75, and bronze medals in 1972, 1978 and 1980. He was runner-up at the 1975 and 1976 World Championships, and won bronzes in 1972, 1978-79. He set three unlimited world records from 1975-76, two in the clean & jerk and one in the total. At the East German Championships, Bonk won the 1971, 1973-77 and 1979 titles, adding another 15 titles in the single disciplines. Having won the bronze medal at the 1972 München Olympics, the silver medal at Montréal in 1976, and bronze medal at the 1980 European Championships, Bonk was not nominated for the Moscow Olympics. Consequently, he retired and returned to his home town Limbach / Vogtland. Having studied as a mechanic and industrial motor car master, he retired at an early age and is considered one of the most famous victims of the GDR doping practice in competitive sports. He was given an enormous quantity of anabolic steroids by East German sports officials. After he failed to perform at a world class level anymore, he slipped down the rankings. He fell ill with diabetes, had kidney problems and became a dialysis patient in a wheelchair. After re-unification he fought for the recognition as a doping victim of the former GDR system. Finally, he received a payment of around 10.000 Euro, but no lifelong pension. In 2002 he was awarded the Georg von Opel Award for Silent Winners in the category “Special Warriors.” In September 2013 he fell into a coma due to multiple organ failure and died in October 2014.",

In 1908 and 1912 he played on the Dutch teams that won the bronze medals in the Olympic football competitions, but his largest national team success was undoubtely in 1913. The Dutch team beat England 2-1, the country’s first victory over the “inventors of the game”. However, the English were an amateur side and their loss made little if any impact back home. De Korver himself was an amateur too, and he considered training to be an unfair advantage over other players, so he never trained. This cost him a spot on the national team for two years, as he refused to show up for the team’s training. However, due his immense popularity and his undoubtable playing qualities he was eventually admitted back on the team. Fair play was important for De Korver, who supposedly never made a foul during his playing career. Such was his fame that a club in rival city Amsterdam was named after him: BDK.",

He rowed against Oxford in 1989, 1899 and 1900 and in his last year, when he was President; a unique record was set when his brother, Thomas was also in the Oxford boat. To counter the strong challenge of the Belgian, who had won the Grand in 1906 and 1907, Great Britain chose a vastly experienced Leander crew for the eights at the 1908 Olympics. The 31-year-old Etherington-Smith rowed a fine race at number seven and after one of the great races in Olympic rowing history, Leander won by two lengths. On leaving Cambridge, Raymond Etherington-Smith qualified as a surgeon but after performing an operation at St. Bartholomew’s Hospital on a gangrenous lung he contacted peritonitis which sadly, caused the death of both patient and surgeon.","Listed in Olympians Who Competed in the Boat Race (1898 Cambridge (lost), 1899 Cambridge (won), 1900 Cambridge (won))"

McDermott was well known as a sprinter in the United States, having won the National Indoor title in 1960 and the North American indoor in 1961. McDermott continued to be a force in the sprints through 1968. He set an American record in the 220 yards which stood for many years, and in 1968, he was again a favorite to take gold in the 500 meters at Grenoble. But on that day Terry McDermott skated late in the field, well after the ice had started to soften in the sun, and he had little chance. Amazingly, he finished in 40.5 to share the silver medal only 2/10ths out of first. Winner Erhard Keller graciously conceded that McDermott had had the best race of the day given the conditions under which he had skated. From 1963 until 1967, Terry McDermott was a barber. In that year, however, he took a job as a manufacturer’s representative in the Detroit area. He has also served as a speed skating official and at the 1980 Olympics spoke the Official’s Oath at the Opening Ceremony of the Olympic Winter Games. McDermott had missed the Closing Ceremony in 1964 as he had already flown home to appear on the Ed Sullivan Show.

The family relocated to Morocco in 1932, where Georges, Jr. learned to swim and became famous in World War II for rescues of fallen soldiers in the Mediterranean waters. In November 1942 he swam out to a sunken French ship, tying a small dinghy to his waist, and then swam several soldiers back to safety on the shore in the dinghy. On 13 May 1943, Vallerey and his friend, Robert Guenet, who helped in the rescue, were given the Croix de Guerre with a Bronze Star. Vallerey, Jr. began competitive swimming after the war and in 1946 swam on a world record setting 3x100 metre medley relay team. In 1947 he won French titles in the 200 breaststroke, 100 and 200 backstroke, and the 400 freestyle. After winning a bronze medal in the 100 back at the 1948 London Olympics, Vallerey continued to compete over the next year. In December 1949 he swam in a Christmas Cup meet in frigid waters, and then developed an infection, which turned into a kidney infection. This led to kidney failure, and he died only a few years later from the effects of that disease. In his memory, Les Tourelles Piscine, where the swimming events of the 1924 Olympic Games were held, was renamed Piscine Georges-Vallerey.

Having been the BAOR heavyweight champion three years in succession, Gardner won the Army title in 1948 and that same year beat the clear favourite Johnny Morkus, with a first round knockout, to win the ABA title at Wembley. Gardner received a call-up to the 1948 London Olympic squad, and reached the quarter-finals, before losing to Switzerland’s Hans Müller. Also in 1948, Gardner boxed for both the Army and the ABA in international contests against Denmark. Having served as a Corporal of the Horse with the Royal Horse Guards, Gardner bought himself out of the Army in October 1948 and turned professional, when he went on to enjoy an 8-year career that saw him win 28 of 34 bouts, 23 by knockout. He beat Bruce Woodcock to win the British and Empire heavyweight titles, and later added the European title. After losing his British title to Johnny Williams in 1952, Gardner retired, but made a comeback the following year, and in 1955 beat Williams in a British title eliminator and was scheduled to fight Don Cockell for the title, A knee injury he received in training, however, meant the fight was cancelled, and Gardner never got another crack at the title. He eventually quit the ring, after losing to Joe Bygraves in April 1956, Gardner retired to his Leicestershire smallholding and poultry farm. He died five days after his 52nd birthday in 1978 from a brain tumour.

Nisbet had a brief spell with Thames RC shortly afterwards, before taking over as captain of the London Rowing Club in 1924. In 1925 Nisbet teamed up with Terence O’Brien, and in 1927 they won the Silver Goblets at Henley. Due to O’Brien being hampered with stitches in a thumb, they lost in their first heat while trying to defend their title against Jack Beresford and Gordon Killick the following year. Nisbet and O’Brien, however, were still selected for the coxless pairs at the 1928 Amsterdam Olympics. Having set an Olympic record of 7:56.2 in their opening heat, they went all the way to the final when, despite a good performance against the German pair of Bruno Müller and Kurt Moeschter, they had to be content with the silver medal. Whilst at London RC, Nisbet also coached the Pembroke eight and in the first heat of the Grand at Henley in 1931, the bow could not race, and Nisbet took his seat. He was also one of the official coaches to the 1935 Cambridge Boat Race crew. Nisbet continued coaching after World War II, and in 1951 was elected vice-president of London RC.

In World War I, he became a pacifist and recorded the atrocities of war. Allegedly, he was to be shot as a deserter but survived. As early as 1916, he dropped his German name and called himself George Grosz. After 1918, he became a member of the Communist Party KPD. Artistically he was assigned to the New Objectivity and the Dadaists. Grosz provoked reactions with his depictions of murder, perversion, and violence. He was also engaged in the characterization of the ruling society of the Weimar Republic, with the economy, military, and clergy. Because of his socially critical paintings and drawings, he was frequently indicted and convicted. In 1932, Grosz was offered a teaching position at the Art Students League in New York, emigrated to the US in 1933, and became a United States citizen in 1938, after which he officially Americanized his name to George Grosz, although he had used that name since 1916 as a protest against German nationalism. His works were included in the “Degenerate Art” exhibition by the Nazis. In 1959 Grosz returned to Germany but soon died after falling down the stairs of his house, while he was severely drunk. His son Peter (1926-2006) became an aviation historian and his son Marty (*1930) one of the best jazz musicians in the United States. In 1977, George Grosz was honored by the German Federal Post Office Berlin with a stamp dedicated at the 15th European art exhibition and again in 1993 on the occasion of his 100th birthday. The oil painting Boxer Schmeling was created in 1926 measuring 109 x 79 cm. It shows the athlete with a broad chest and sinewy arms.

In ski jumping, he set two new Polish records (27 m in 1922 and 38 m in 1923). Despite being selected as a member of the Polish team for the 1924 Winter Olympics he did not start, probably due to a broken leg. At the 1925 World Championships, he finished 44th in both the 18 km cross-country and jumping. His last major success was the Czechoslovakian ski jumping title in 1926. That same year, he emigrated to France, where he became known as skier and mountaineer. He worked as a tennis coach in the summer and ran a ski school in the winter. Later he taught physical education at the Lyon University. In Chamonix, he owned a sporting goods store and was co-owner of a hotel.

Having first appeared in the AAA Championship just two days after her 16th birthday in 1951, and finishing third, Pashley was the 100 yards champion in both 1953 and 1954. She won a silver medal as part of the England 4 x 110 yards relay team at the 1954 Commonwealth Games in Vancouver, and followed that with an individual bronze medal at that year’s European Championship at Bern, Switzerland. In Olympic year, 1956, she was runner-up to June Paul in the Women’s AAA 100 yards before being part of the Great Britain sprint relay team that won the silver medal at the Melbourne Games when she was just 21 years of age. She was studying at the Guildhall School of Music & Drama in London at the time of the Olympics, and it was as an opera singer that was to find fame as one of the leading British sopranos of her time. She made her stage début in 1959 with the Handel Opera Society in Semele, and appeared at the Glyndebourne Festival for the first time in 1962 and at Covent Garden in 1965 as Barbarina in Mozart’s Le nozze di Figaro.

87473,Dan Jansen,Male,17 June 1965,183.0,88, United States,USA,"Dan Jansen is considered among the greatest sprint speed skaters ever. He won numerous times on the World Cup circuit and at World Championships, and his only failing was a relative lack of success at the Olympic Games. But in some ways his Olympic performances were his greatest success, revealing his character. Jansen competed at the 1984 Winter Olympics before his prime, but in 1988 he won the World Sprint Championships one week before the Olympics and was favored in both the 500 and 1,000 metre races. The day of the 500 metres, he was informed that his sister, Jane, who was sick with leukemia, was close to death. Only a few hours before the start of the race, he found that she had died. Jansen started, but fell as he entered the first turn. A few days later, he skated the 1,000 metres and fell again. But he reacted with a grace and magnanimity so rarely seen in athletes after crushing defeats. At the 1992 Winter Olympics, Jansen was again favored and again struggled, placing fourth in the 500 and 26th in the 1,000. He had no excuses and he offered none. Coming to the 1994 Winter Olympics, Jansen was again a favorite, at least in the 500, but in that race he started on the outer, and on the final turn, his speed was so great that he slightly lost control and put his hand down to steady himself, losing a few tenths of a second, and placing only eighth in the race. His last chance for a gold medal seemed lost, until a few days later, when he resurrected his Olympic record by winning a gold medal in the 1,000 in world record time. In his victory lap, he carried his young daughter around the rink with him – her name was Jane. During his career, Dan Jansen won 46 World Cup races (second all-time), and seven overall World Cups, as well as two World Sprint Championships (1988 and 1994). He also set eight senior world records, five in the 500, two in the sprint combination, and one 1,000 record at the Lillehammer Olympics. After retiring Jansen worked as a motivational speaker, and as a sales rep for an orthopaedic equipment company.

The daughter of Mario, secretary-general of the Italian Olympic committee for many years, Paolo Saini was a diverse swimmer, and was as competent at freestyle as she was at backstroke and butterfly, particularly over 100 metres. In 1960 Saini reached the 100 metres freestyle semi-final at the Roma Olympics, becoming the first Italian woman to do so. She also helped the 4x100 relay squad reach the final, where they finished seventh in a new national record 4:26.8. Saini was one of the favourites to win the 100 free title at the 1962 European Championships in Leipzig, but she failed, and in finishing sixth lost her best chance of winning an international gold medal. At the 1964 Tokyo Olympics, she again helped the relay squad reach the final, where they finished eighth in another national record, 4:17.2. In January 1966 Saini was devastated by the Bremen air tragedy that claimed the lives of seven Italian swimmers, the coach, and a sports commentator. The death of Olympian Sergio De Gregorio hit her hard because she was very close to him. Later that same year, Saini retired from swimming. Throughout her career Saini set the following 19 national freestyle records: 100 metres (7), 200 metres (8) and 400 metres (4). In addition she set seven butterfly records and two in the 400 metres medley. All were set in 50-metre pools, the only size pool in which Italian records were recognised at the time. Between 1960-62 she lowered the 100 free record from 1:07.7 to 1:03.5, the biggest improvement over the distance ever registered by an Italian woman. Saini graduated in biological science, and dedicated herself to teaching in Italy and later in Spain and Turkey, before returning to Italy in the second part of the 1990s.",

75095,Iolanda Balaș,Female,12 December 1936,185.0,72, Romania,ROU,"Born near Johnny Weissmuller’s home, Balaș got into athletics through her caretaker, former high jumper Luisa Ernst. She made her debut in 1949, and developed a jumping technique which was not deemed advantageous, a variation of the scissor technique but without the rotation of the torso and with the legs opening, instead of coming together towards the bar. In 1955, before the Melbourne Games, she jumped 1.75 m setting the first of her 14 world records (plus 4 indoor). She was the favourite at the Australian Olympics, but she placed only fifth and the winner, the American Millie McDaniel, broke Balaș’s world record. On 22 June 1958 in Cluj, she became the first woman to exceed 1.80 m. She won her first gold at the 1960 Rome Olympic Games, reaching 1.85 m, 14 cm more than the second placed Pole Jaroslawa Jozwiakowska. “My first obstacle is the bar. It would be good to have a rival”, she often repeated at the time. In Japan, despite suffering from tendon and knee problems, she won the gold by jumping 1.90 m. The tendon problems forced her to abstain from the European Championships in 1966. She retired officially in 1967, losing a competition after 140 consecutive victories (unbeaten since 1958). During her career she won two European golds (1958-62), and one silver (1954), apart from the indoor gold in 1966. Her last world record, 1.91 in 1961, lasted for 10 years.

In 1988, she reached fourth place in the overall World Cup, while placing third in single event World Cups on four occasions. Although a consistent top 10 performer at international championships, Fernández never medalled until the Albertville Olympics slalom.

His art works – mostly nature and landscape paintings – decorate the Japanese Imperial Palace and the Crown Prince’s palace. They adorn Japanese cult sites such as the famous temple of Toshodaiji in Nara, and various museums and buildings around the world. Japanese landscape painting was never primarily meant to be a realistic representation of nature, but rather more of an expression of spiritual well-being and the artist’s state of mind. In 1933-35 Higashiyama traveled to Germany as an exchange student to study Western art history. He was one of the first students selected for the German-Japanese cultural exchange program. After World War II, Higashiyama worked temporarily as an essayist, but also learned to use gold and silver dust to make his colors more vivid. This Kirikane technique was widely used in Japan. During his lifetime he often went back to visit Germany and was very impressed by famous German artists such as Albrecht Dürer, Matthias Grünwald, Casper David Friedrich and Emil Nolde. The painting Shōnen kōri hashi (Boys Skating_) was created in 1931 after Higashiyama graduated from the Department of Classical Japanese Art at the Academy in Tokyo and showed a peculiar mixture of rather Western figures in front of a Japanese landscape typical of Higashiyama. This landscape depicts Lake Aoki in Nagano Prefecture.",

Between 1956 and 1962, Karavayev was nearly unbeatable, winning almost every match. Although Karavayev won his first Soviet title in 1956, he missed that year’s Olympics, as the Soviet sports officials thought he was still too inexperienced and did not select him for the Soviet Olympic team. At the next three major international tournaments, however, the 1958 World Championships, the 1960 Olympics and the 1961 World Championships, Karavayev did not lose a match and won three major international titles in a row. Karavayev last competed internationally at the 1963 World Championships, where he lost unexpectedly to eventual gold medal winner János Varga from Hungary and drew with Ion Cernea, to settle for fourth place. Domestically, Karavayev won the Soviet title six times (1956-60 and 1962) and retired from sports in 1964, when he was not selected for the Soviet 1964 Olympic team. After finishing his sporting career, Karavayev worked as a wrestling coach, as the head coach of the Belorussian SSR wrestling team at the end of 1960s and as a wrestling coach with Burevestnik Minsk from 1971-78. During his sporting career, however, Karavayev already had troubles with alcohol, preferring partying to training, and his alcohol abuse worsened after his retirement. He died in 1978 due to alcohol related causes, at only 42-years-old. Since 1992, an annual memorial tournament in Greco-Roman wrestling has been held in Minsk in his honor.",

The two had a difficult relationship at first, but the young Diana persevered and the two became inseparable. Planning to become a jumper, she tried her hand at eventing and at a one-day event at Epperstone, Nottinghamshire, she beat the experienced John Oram. Tramella and Diana first competed at Badminton in 1953 and finished a creditable 19th but the following year the pair finished third and then helped Great Britain win the team event at the European championships in Basle when Diana became the first woman to ever be selected for a British three day event team. That European success was repeated at Windsor a year later, despite Tramella falling during the cross country section. Having retired Tramella from eventing, they switched to dressage and in 1963 they completed a unique double when they became the first and only combination to win European championships at two different disciplines after they were part of the British team that won the dressage team title. Sadly, Tramella was put down in the Winter of 1974 at the age of 28. Diana made her Olympic debut with her new horse Special Edition in 1976. Diana was the oldest member of the entire Great Britain team at the 1988 Seoul Olympics when she partnered her next horse Prince Consort who had had made its Olympic debut four years earlier. Diana was one of the reserves and Great Britain’s Chef d’Equipe for the 1984 Los Angeles Games and when Jennie Loriston-Clarke’s horse Dutch Courage caught a virus, Prince Consort was flown to the United States for Loriston-Clarke to ride. Diana bowed out of international competition in 1991 after riding Prince Consort in the Netherlands. Mason was the Chairman of the British Horse Society Dressage Group, the predecessor of British Dressage, for 17 years from 1975 to 1992, and was also the chairman of the British selectors but resigned her position in 1992 shortly before the Barcelona Olympics following the committee’s decision to leave Jennie Loristion-Clarke, its most experienced dressage rider, out of the Olympic team. Honoured with the OBE for services to equestrian sport in 2008, Diana Mason continued her role as a dressage judge up to 2013 when she was 80. She had the honour of being Britain’s team manager the first time equestrianism was included in the Paralympics, at Atlanta in 1996.",

In 1953 Shilkov captured the Soviet all-round title, repeating the feat in 1954 and 1955. In addition to his three all-round Soviet titles, Shilkov won seven Soviet distance titles (1,500 m (1953-55), 5,000 m (1953-55) and 10,000 m (1955)). Shilkov made his international début at the 1953 World All-round Championships and won silver behind his compatriot Oleg Goncharenko, who would remain his closest rival throughout his career. At the 1954 World All-round Championships, Shilkov beat Goncharenko and won the world title. He also captured his only European All-round title in that year. In 1955 in Medeo, Dmitry Sakunenko became the first person to skate 5,000 metres below eight minutes, with 7:54.9. In a later pair Shilkov then improved this world record to 7:45.6, which was considered almost unbelievable at the time, but at the 1956 Olympics Shilkov proved this time was not impossible after all, when he finished only three seconds above his own World Record to win the Olympic gold. In addition to his gold and silver at the World All-round Championships, Shilkov won another silver in 1957 and bronze in 1955. He also won the following distance medals at the World Championships: 500 m – silver (1953 and 1955); 1,500 m – gold (1953-54, 1956-57) and bronze (1955); 5,000 m – silver (1954) and bronze (1957); and 10,000 m – bronze (1954). At the European Championships, Shilkov was less successful, winning, in addition to his only all-round title, the following distance medals: 500 m – gold (1958); 1,500 m – gold (1954) and silver (1957); and 5,000 m – bronze (1954). In spite of his Olympic gold and World Record at 5,000 m, Shilkov often had problems with the longest distance. Three times he led after three distances, only to lose because of a bad 10K. After his sporting career Boris Shilkov had a long and successful career as a skating coach and official. From 1959-62 he was a coach with Trud Leningrad and then from 1962-64 and 1966-68 he was the head coach of the Soviet national team. After that he worked as a skating coach in Leningrad (now St. Petersburg) and finished his coaching career from 1979 until his retirement in 1989 with Dynamo Leningrad.

He was the national champion nine years in succession between 1928-36, and added a 10th title in 1939. In addition, he won four Scottish, nine Welsh and two Irish titles. Whitford also won national team titles with the Swansea YMCA. At the 1928 Amsterdam Olympics he was the highest placed British gymnast in the team event, as was the case every time he represented Great Britain. Whitford took up gymnastics at the Sketty Church Lads’ Club at the age of 12. After the club closed he was away from the sport for barely two years until Whitford’s cousin took him to the Swansea YMCA in 1926 where coach Walter Standish immediately saw a huge future for what was a frail-looking youngster. Under Standish’s guidance, Whitford developed quickly and, within two weeks at his new club, represented them in the final of the Boys’ Team Championship of Wales against Newport. When Whitford won his first national title in 1928, it was ironic that it was the first time the championship had been held in Wales, and furthermore, it was at Swansea. After winning his ninth consecutive national title in 1936 Whitford gave up competing competitively, but returned two years later after his father talked him in to preparing for the 1940 Helsinki Olympics. Within three weeks of his comeback, Whitford won his tenth national title. With no competitive gymnastics during the World War II, Whitford coached gymnasts at his own club, the Sketty Olympic Gymnasium, which he had opened in 1933. It was there that he coached his younger half-brother Jack to become national champion three times, in 1947-48, and 1952. Arthur was asked to coach the British men’s team and the 1948 and 1952 Olympics, and in 1953 played a big part in getting a Welsh team, representing Great Britain, to compete at the first Gymnaestrada at Rotterdam. Whitford followed his master shoemaker father into the boot and shoe business. Originally he was a boot and shoe retailer, and then became a leather merchant. Arthur was inaugurated into the Welsh Sports Hall of Fame in 2004.",Half-brother of Jack Whitford Brother-in-law of Pat Evans

He went on to make the Olympic team for Amsterdam, where he won the first of his gold medals. His 200m victory over Paddock at the Southwest Trials was Wykoff’s only major win at this distance, although his time of 20.8 showed his potential in the longer sprint. Wykoff wisely chose to concentrate on the 100y/100m and in 1930 he ran the first official 9.4 for 100 yards, breaking the world record. While at Southern Cal, he won three IC4A (1930-32), two NCAA (1930-31), and two AAU (1928, 1931) dash titles.

With Arno Breker, Thorak was considered among the most important and valued sculptors by the Nazis. The son of an East Prussian potter first learned this craft before studying at the academies in Wien (Vienna) and Berlin. Since 1920 he worked as a freelance artist. His penchant for monumental sculptures gave him several lucrative government contracts. Especially his friend Albert Speer, Minister of Armaments and War Production, promoted him with large sums. Thorak created the Turkish Liberation Monument in Eskişehir and the bronze statue Faustkämpfer (Pugilist) of the boxer Max Schmeling for the Reichssportfeld at the 1936 Berlin Olympics. He was divorced from his Jewish wife in 1934 and followed the official Nazi notions of monumental art. In 1937 he became a teacher at the Art Academy in München (Munich). His wife Hilda and his son Peter went missing during the war. After World War II, Thorak was classified as “not affected” in a de-Nazification process and two appeal proceedings, and was eventually allowed to resume working and exhibiting. After the Second World War, he underwent de-Nazification and was allowed to continue working. After the war he lived alone at Salzburg and in Bavaria. Most of his monumental statues were later destroyed. Boxer Max Schmeling was Thorak’s neighbor in Berlin and posed as a model for him as well as his wife, actress Anni Ondra.

2900,Nikolai Stepulov,Male,20 March 1913,,, Estonia,EST,"Nikolai Stepulov lived a very controversial life. During his sporting career, he was considered as a hero by the Estonian people, but his actions during the first days of World War II brought him the reputation as a war criminal and a traitor to Estonia and in his later life, Stepulov was just a plain criminal. Stepulov took up boxing in 1927 and soon rose to be one of the top boxers of the country. During his youth, Stepulov was known for his leftist views and his first international tournament was the second Workers’ Olympiad held in 1931 in Vienna, where he won a bronze medal. Stepulov won six Estonian titles in a row from 1933-37, the first five in lightweight and the last in welterweight. Stepulov competed at the 1936 Olympics and at the 1934 and 1937 European Championships, winning silvers at the Olympics and 1937 Europeans, losing in the Olympic final to Hungarian Imre Harangi by decision and to German Herbert Nürnberg in 1937, also by decision. At the time of the 1936 Olympics, Stepulov served in the Estonian Army as a private and was raised to the rank of corporal after the Olympics. After his service Stepulov worked as a messenger with the Ministry of Economic Affairs, but turned professional in 1938. As a professional, Stepulov was not very successful and when World War II cut his career short, Stepulov had a record of 5 wins (4 KO), 5 losses (KOby 2) and 1 draw. In 1940, when Soviet troops occupied Estonia, Stepulov enlisted in the Soviet militia, and as he had served in the Army before, he was given his own squad to lead. The Soviet militia’s first assignment in newly occupied Estonia was to gather weapons from the members of the Estonian Defense League, an Estonian paramilitary defense organization. On the morning of 21 June 1940, Stepulov gave his squad the order to shoot mostly unarmed members of the Estonian Defense League who had voluntarily gathered in their command post in Tallinn to give up their weapons. The firefight resulted in 17 dead and over a dozen wounded and after that action the communists faith in Stepulov also faded and he was arrested. Stepulov spent most of World War II in prison and after his release, took up boxing again. In 1945, Stepulov won a silver in welterweight at the first Estonian SSR Championships, but soon after that retired from boxing. After retiring from boxing, Stepulov was unable to find a steady job, working mostly in temporary jobs in various factories, as a turf cutter, as a lumberjack and as occasional boxing coach and referee. Stepulov also started drinking and eventually fell in with a bad element. In 1955, Stepulov was arrested on burglary charges for the first time and was sentenced to seven years in prison. Although he was paroled after four years, the rest of his life was spent in and out of prison, mostly on burglary charges. In his later years, Stepulov suffered from Parkinson’s disease and died in Tallinn’s Central Prison hospital on the second day of 1968, just two months before his 55th birthday.",

Sayles was an Oregon native who played college ball at the University of Oregon. After graduating he played semi-pro ball in Vancouver and recorded a 14-4 mark, attracting the attention of Major League scouts. After one year of minor league ball, Sayles was called up to the Boston Red Sox in July 1939. He pitched in five games that season in relief, but struggled. After three more years in the minors and a trade to the New York Giants, Sayles came back to the majors in May 1939. He pitched in 23 games that season, 18 with the Giants, and then 5 more after a trade to the Brooklyn Dodgers. That was the end of his Major League career. Sayles joined the US Army Air Force in February 1944, and was assigned to be a tail gunner. However, he ended up as a physical education instructor at Fort Lewis, Washington. While there he further injured his arm and could never pitch again. After the war, Sayles played one more year of minor league ball with the Asheville Tourists of the Class-B Tri-State League, playing as an outfielder and managing the team. He was again their player-manager in 1947, but retired from baseball after that season. He and his family settled back in Oregon where he worked for a forest products company. In 1957 Sayles returned to baseball as assistant general manager of the Vancouver Mounties of the Pacific Coast League, a position he held until 1959, when he became general manager. In 1962 he left that job and became the West Coast scouting supervisor for the St. Louis Cardinals, which he did until 1982.

During World War II Manninen served in the 10th Mountain Division, under General Lucien Truscott. In combat near Castel d’Aiano in April 1945, Manninen saw a fellow soldier taken down by German machine gun fire. He was obviously grievously injured so Manninen risked his own life, under fire, to go 40 metres out onto the field and bring the soldier back to safety in a shell crater where he could be treated. The man he saved was Bob Dole, who had suffered nerve damage to his right arm that would affect him for the rest of his life. However, this did not prevent Dole from entering politics, serving in the US senate, and serving as the Republican vice-presidential candidate in 1976 and the Republican presidential candidate in 1996, although he did not win either election. Manninen received the Silver Star for his rescue of Dole, was frequently mentioned by Dole in his speeches, and was publicly thanked by him in his first Presidential debate with future President Bill Clinton. He later included more details of Manninen’s heroism during a speech to the National Italian-American Foundation in Washington, DC. Dole also included the story in his memoir One Soldier’s Story, published in 2005, six years after Manninen’s death at the age of 81. “Ollie’s quick thinking and courageous action probably prevented me from being shredded by the German machine-gunners,” Dole wrote.

He also represented the New York AC and in 1897 was a member of their relay team which won the first AAU championship.

For his first senior season he joined the Winnipeg Hockey Club and, in 1931, captured the Allan Cup with his team, given annually to the senior men’s ice hockey champions in Canada. It was this victory that paved the way for the Winnipegs to represent Canada at the 1932 Winter Olympics, where they eventually won the gold medal at the hockey tournament. At the Olympics he played in five matches and scored six goals in the position of forward, a change decided by Coach Jack Hughes to capitalize on Simpson’s scoring ability. Simpson then trained to be on the Canadian rowing team for that year’s summer Olympics, but did not actually attend. He spent his first post-Olympic season with the Windsor Bulldogs of the International Hockey League (during its 1929-1936 incarnation), but also played one game with the Quebec Castors of the Canadian-American Hockey League. During this time he also had a brief stint with the National Hockey League’s Montreal Maroons, but was cut from the team in 1933. His final season as a player consisted of 14 games with the Montreal Royals of the Quebec Senior Hockey League.

66531,Luo Wenao,Male,1919,,, People's Republic of China,CHN,"Lou Wenao was born into a family from Zhejiang Province. After suffering from typhoid, he became deaf and dumb at the age of three. In 1943, he was attracted to long distance running. After a period of hard training, Lou broke the national 10,000 m record twice at meetings in Nanjing and Shanghai in 1947. In early 1948, Lou had his first successful appearance in the United States, winning 5 and 10 km, as well as 10 mile races in California. In May 1948, at the 7th National Games held in Shanghai, Lou took the title in the 5,000 m with yet another national record of 16:08.0. A few days later, he clocked 32:37.0 clinching the 10,000 m and breaking the Asian record and subsequently, he further improved his PB. This earned him a place on the Chinese team for the 1948 London Olympics. Unaccustomed to wearing spikes, Lou was injured by a spike piercing the sole of his foot in 10,000 m race. Nevertheless, he participated in the heat of the 5000 m, but failed to qualify. Although he never trained for a marathon, he was entered into the Olympic race and was second at the 20 km mark, but when his foot started to bleed, he fainted and had to be carried to an ambulance. Later that year, together with his tutor Wang Zhenglin Lou took part in long distance runs and marathons in the US. They both went back to China where the People’s Liberation Army had just taken control. In 1950, he returned to the United States under a temporary residence permit, resuming his running career at the University of Southern California. During the next years, he won some prestigious races including the Western Hemisphere Marathon at Culver City and the four-mile Golden State Championship Run at UCLA. In 1954, he had to terminate his athletic career due to a foot injury. During this time, he worked as an assistant cook in a local restaurant. When Lou’s temporary permit expired in 1955 he was to be deported back to China. Because he had appeared in pro-American broadcasts by the “Voice of America”, he anticipated prosecution in his homeland. His coach, employer and other friends tried to obtain a permanent resident status for Lou. When he had already boarded a boat to China, the Department of Immigration granted him permission to stay permanently, not least based on testimonies by the staff of the “Voice of America”.

A carpenter by trade, a workplace accident on a construction site forced him to quit, but he also grew up hunting and became a proficient marksman. Klas Lestander opted out of the 1959 World Championships in Sweden and focused rather on the Pre-Olympics in order to prepare well for the Olympics. It paid off in 1960 at Squaw Valley when he won gold in the first Olympic biathlon competition. In his gold medal race, Lestander only had the 15th best running time of the 30 participants, but thanks to flawless shooting he had the best corrected time, and this was the first time in an international championship that someone hit all 20 targets. The following year at the World Championships in Umeå, he took an unofficial bronze as a member of the Swedish relay team but was only ninth in the individual race, and he retired from competition after the 1961 season. Lestander never won a Swedish Championship. Klas Lestander lived throughout his life in his native Arjeplog, where a square was named after him.

He was fourth in the foil in 1936 and was not selected for the Egyptian delegation to that year’s Berlin Olympics, but in 1937 he was the national sabre champion, sixth in the foil, and seventh in the épée. In 1938, he was third in the individual foil, while in 1939 he captured both the foil and sabre titles. Younes’ fencing activity picked up again after World War II, and he won his first major international medal, bronze in the team sabre, at the 1947 World Championships. That year, he was also the national foil champion again, and he was then selected to represent Egypt at the 1948 London Olympics in every event except the individual sabre. His nation was eliminated in the quarter-finals of the team épée and sabre events, while in the foil they survived until the semi-finals. Individually, Younes made the quarter-finals of the foil and the semi-finals of the épée. He then defended his team sabre bronze at the 1949 World Championships and also added bronze in the épée and foil team competitions. He would take bronze in the team foil over the next two years, as well as team sabre bronze in 1950. Younes’ next stop was the inaugural Mediterranean Games in 1951, where he captured medals in all of the team events: silver in sabre and bronze in foil and épée. He would go on to take bronze in all three of those competitions again at the next edition in 1955. In-between, he represented Egypt at the 1952 Helsinki Olympics, where his nation just missed the podium in fourth in the team foil and Younes was sixth individually. In the team épée and foil, Egypt was eliminated in round one and the quarter-finals respectively. Having served as an official already at the 1948 Games, Younes returned to the Olympics once more in 1960 in that capacity.","Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the World Fencing Championships (0–0–7 1947 Lisboa bronze: sabre team; 1949 Al-Qahira bronze: épée team, foil team, and sabre team; 1950 Monte Carlo bronze: foil team and sabre team; 1951 Stockholm bronze: foil team) Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the Mediterranean Games (0–1–5 1951 Al-Iskanderiya FEN silver: sabre team, bronze: foil team and épée team; 1955 Barcelona FEN bronze: foil team, épée team, and sabre team)"

But it was for his humourus drawings that he was better known. He was educated at King Edward VI school in Berkhamsted before studying at the Gloucester School of Art. After setting up a studio in London he enjoyed nothing more than drawing London life and the people therein and then adding amusing captions to his work. The title of his first major exhibition at the Leicester Galleries in Leicester Square in 1909 was entitled “London Life and Characters”. Belcher was also noted for making serious drawings of strange looking people. His work was soon spotted by various periodicals and he obtained commissions with the leading magazines of the day, Tatler and Punch. Belcher exhibited at the Royal Academy from 1909 and was admitted as a full member of the Academy in 1945 shortly before his death. All three works submitted by Belcher are hand-colored etchings. In the original, the sheets bear more comprehensive titles: The Wild Irishman from the National Sporting Club, Two Veterans of the National Sporting Club and A Hero of the Ring & his Agent. The National Sporting Club, all of them with the addition: “taken from Life”. The Wild Irishman was boxer Pat O’Keefe, multiple British Middleweight Champion. Two Veterans features Bill Baxter and Arthur Guttridge, in 1918 two elderly gentlemen who, as former boxers, were important figures in the British boxing scene of the 1880s-1900s. Hero of the Ring is a scene starring boxer Jimmy Wilde and his agent Teddy Lewis. Belcher’s series of character studies was made in 1917-1921 for the National Sporting Club, the predecessor of the British Boxing Board of Control.

Keflezighi ran in college at UCLA, winning four NCAA titles. He was a three-time US cross-country champion, winning in 2001-02 and 2009. At the 2001 World Cross-Country Championship he helped the US team to a bronze medal finish. Although he ran the 10,000 metres at the 2000 Sydney Olympics, Keflezighi focused on the marathon and road races in later years and ran the marathon at the 2004, 2012, and 2016 Olympics. In 2009 he won the New York City Marathon, the first American man to win that event since Alberto Salazar in 1982. Meb had previously been on the podium at New York twice, winning silver in 2004 and bronze in 2005. In 2014 Keflezighi started the Boston Marathon one year after the horrific bombing that occurred at the 2013 Boston Marathon, in which three people were killed and 100s injured by bombs left near the finish line by two psychopathic brothers. At the time a US runner had not won the men’s race since 1983 (Greg Meyer), and Keflezighi was not considered among the favorites. Inspired by the memory of the tragedy, however, and the crowds that supported him, he pulled away to win the race in the last miles and became a hero to the Boston people. For his victory at Boston Meb was given the Jesse Owens Award by the USATF as Athlete of the Year. His victory made him the first runner to win the New York Marathon, the Boston Marathon, and an Olympic marathon medal. Keflezighi was inducted into the UCLA Athletics Hall of Fame in 2010.

He only failed to win Wimbledon that year but did reach the tournament’s semi-finals with Edberg. The following year began his long partnership with John Fitzgerald, with the pair finishing runners-up at both the French Open and Wimbledon. In 1989 Järryd finally won at Wimbledon when he and Fitzgerald beat the American pair of Rick Leach and Jim Pugh. In 1991 he and Fitzgerald were triumphant at the French Open, Wimbledon, and the US Open. While he never won a Grand Slam singles title, Järryd still had an impressive record reaching the quarter-finals of the Australian Open (1987–88) and the US Open (1985), and the semi-finals of Wimbledon (1985). Järryd competed in the singles and doubles at the 1988 Seoul Olympics. In the singles he lost to qualifier Carl-Uwe Steeb in the third round but won the bronze medal with Stefan Edberg in the doubles.

Bona won from start-to-finish, to beat Captain J. Orr Ewing and Eelin, into second place. For the 1900 season, Taylor took delivery of the 45-footer Bona Fide, and again enjoyed a successful first season with his new boat. Racing in the Mediterranean, they won 16 races from 25 starts, including the 3-10 ton class at the Paris Olympics. Taylor missed the first race because there was a delay in obtaining clearance by French Customs. However, he arrived at Meulan in time for the second race, which he duly won by a margin of more than five minutes. While in France, Taylor sold Bona Fide to an Italian, and the winning Olympic yacht returned to southern waters. By profession, Taylor was a London stockbroker, but the lure of adventure took him to South Africa and then to Australia in 1890, where he was involved in various activities, including farming, the Ashburton gold rush and also returned to his roots of stockbroking. He was also involved in politics, and Taylor served in the Parliament of Western Australia between 1896-99, resigning a couple of months after purchasing Bona.

She played lacrosse and squash at the national level, but was most accomplished in the fields of diving and fencing. She captured Irish championships in both sports, but it was for her skills in the former that she was offered the chance to compete at the 1948 Summer Olympics. When the time came, however, she requested to be entered into the fencing tournament instead. Her wish was granted, but she failed to advance beyond the opening round of the individual foil after losing all of her bouts. Even outside of active competition, Dermody’s life revolved around athletics and she served as a teacher of physical education in several different capacities, most notably at Alexandra College from 1943 through 1958.

His breakthrough year was 1990, when he was first crowned Canadian national champion in the middleweight category and won the division at the Pan American Championships. He was Canadian champion again in 1991 and 1992, and finished seventh at the 1991 World Championships. He was selected to represent Canada at the 1992 Summer Olympics where, in a surprising upset, he defeated tournament favorite Hirotaka Okada of Japan in the semi-finals of their pool. Gill then lost to Waldemar Legień of Poland, the eventual gold medalist, but bested Adrian Croitoru of Romania in the repêchage to win a bronze medal. When he earned his podium spot, however, “there was not one Canadian reporter on-site” according to one national media source. Gill would work hard to change that. In 1993 he slipped to third at the Canadian championships, but won a silver medal at the Worlds, bested by Yoshio Nakamura of Japan in the finals. He retook the Canadian title in 1994 and held it through the 1996 Summer Olympics, where he finished seventh after being defeated by eventual bronze medalists Marko Spittka of Germany in the semifinals of his bracket and Mark Huizinga of the Netherlands in the repêchage. Along the way he won gold at the 1995 Pan American Games and bronze at that year’s World Championships. In 1997 he moved up to the half-heavyweight division, where he would remain for the rest of his career, and won four more Canadian championships (1997-1999, and 2001) for a total of ten, despite being hampered by knee surgery in September 1997. He defended his title at the 1999 Pan American Games and won bronze at the World Championships that year before entering the 2000 Summer Olympics, where he captured a silver medal after losing in the final to the great Kosei Inoue of Japan. He dropped to seventh at the 2001 World Championships, but won a gold medal at the Commonwealth Games the following year. He was fifth at the World Championships in 2003, but won silver at the Pan American Games, losing to Mário Sabino Júnior of Brazil in the finals. At the 2004 Summer Olympics Gill was Canada’s flagbearer, having come a long way since the nation’s media had ignored him in 1992.

59,Kitty McKane,Female,7 May 1896,,, Great Britain,GBR,"With a bronze in the singles, a silver in the mixed doubles and a gold in the women’s doubles, Kitty McKane acquired a full set of medals at the 1920 Olympic Games. Her bronze medal in the 1920 singles was won in unique circumstances: as she wished to be at her best to partner Winifred McNair in the doubles she conceded a walkover in the semi-final of the singles but still qualified to play in the bronze medal match against Sigrid Fick of Sweden, which she duly won. She won two more medals at the 1924 Games in Paris but despite a total of five Olympic medals she will be remembered for more notable successes in other tournaments. Although London-born, Kitty McKane learned her tennis at St. Leonard’s School in Scotland and made her tournament début at Roehampton in April 1919. A few weeks later she reached the quarter-finals on her first appearance at Wimbledon and soon took over the role of Britain’s number one player from Dorothy Lambert Chambers. By 1924 she had established herself as a world class player and confirmed her status by beating the great Helen Wills in the Wightman Cup, repeating the feat at Wimbledon a few days later. In a classic Wimbledon final, McKane lost the first set and trailed 1-4 in the second but came back to hand Helen Wills her only defeat in a singles match in nine appearances at Wimbledon. In January 1926, Kitty McKane married Leslie Godfree while they were on a tennis tour of South Africa and later that year they achieved the ultimate in familial success by becoming the only husband and wife pairing ever to win the mixed doubles at Wimbledon. In 1926 she also won her second Wimbledon singles title and reached the final of the women’s doubles for the third time, the first time having been in 1922 when she was partnered by her sister, Margaret Stocks. Although she never succeeded in winning the women’s doubles at Wimbledon, McKane had a fine record in other major championship doubles, winning the US title in 1923 and 1927 and the US mixed doubles in 1925. Kathleen McKane Godfree’s record as a tennis player was matched by her success at badminton. She won eight All-England titles (four singles, two doubles, two mixed), her victories in the doubles coming with her sister, Margaret, as her partner. Her sporting talents were not restricted to racket games. As a nine-year-old she cycled 600 miles from London to Berlin on a family “outing”. The following year she was awarded the bronze medal of the National Skating Association, and in 1914 she was selected to play for England against Scotland in the lacrosse international but the game was called off due to the outbreak of war.",Wife of Leslie Godfree

In an era in which this rarely occurred, he was even approached by the New York Giants of the NFL to play for them, an offer he spurned to remain in Ottawa.

Leoncillo studied at the Art Institute in Perugia and at the Art Academy Roma. There, he also worked as a drawing teacher and came into contact with artists who opposed the official concept of art. During World War II he joined the Italian partisans. He worked for a ceramics company in Umbria, mostly with terracotta. His creations were typically large polychrome ceramics, often with an expressionistic figurative intent. In addition, he always published drawings. From 1942-1952 Leonardi taught ceramic sculpturing at the Istituto statale d’arte in Rome. From 1946 he had a studio in the Villa Massimo and had his first solo exhibitions. Leonardi produced several ceramics charting the passage from his neo-Cubist period of the late 1940s to his participation in Italy’s explosion of Arte Informale, which was to have considerable influence in Europe and America. He was a co-founder of the New Artistic Secession in 1946 and is considered Italy’s most important informal sculptor. One of his most famous works is the Monument to the Dead Soldiers of All Wars in Albissola Marina in Liguria from 1955.

8704,"Roy Jones, Jr.",Male,16 January 1969,180.0,71, United States,USA,"Roy Jones, Jr. won the Val Barker Award at the 1988 Olympics as the most technically proficient boxer in Seoul. It was given to him as a sort of apology for what was the worst decision in Olympic boxing history. In the final of the light-middleweight class, Jones faced Korean Park Si-Hun, and punished him. There was no doubt that Jones had won every round, and won each convincingly, but at the end the referee raised Park’s hand. Park even apologized, later saying, “I am sorry. I lost the fight. I feel very bad.” One of the judges later revealed that he felt so badly for the Korean, fighting in front of his hometown fans, that he gave him the vote, feeling it would make the result only 4-1 for Jones. Unfortunately, two other judges did the same thing, given the decision to Park, 3-2. This did not stop Roy Jones, Jr., who went on to a superb professional career over the next 15 years. He is one of those fighters who held, for a time, the unofficial crown of “best pound-for-pound fighter in the world.” Jones won world titles in eight weight classes, and for multiple organizations, even moving up to win the WBA Heavyweight title. The Boxing Writers Association of America named Jones Fighter of the Decade for the 1990s.

Brooks thus did not get his gold medal and 20 years later, as the coach of the American “Miracle on Ice,” he would again be denied that honor because the coaches do not receive medals. But Brooks certainly gained a measure of pride in leading the 1980 U.S. ice hockey team to the Olympic gold medal. Herb Brooks was small at 5-11 (1.80) and 168 lbs. (76 kg.), but played hockey for four years at Minnesota. Although cut from the 1960 Olympic team, he played on both the 1964 and 1968 U.S. Olympic teams, but neither team won a medal. Brooks also represented the United States four other times in international competition. Brooks became the coach at his alma mater in the early 70s and led the Minnesota hockey powerhouse to several NCAA championships. After his Olympic success, he was courted by several NHL clubs but turned them all down to coach with a Swiss team in a European league. But Brooks later returned to the United States to coach in the NHL, first with the New York Rangers. Brooks’ NHL coaching career never achieved the height expected of him. He later worked in various administrative jobs for NHL teams. He was team manager of the French hockey team at the 1998 Olympics, and in 2002, returned as the U.S. Olympic coach, leading them to a silver medal. In 2004, a movie of the 1980 U.S. ice hockey team, Miracle, was made.

He became interested in the sport after watching it at the 1994 Lillehammer Winter Games at the age of nine. He started training with the US Luge Association’s (USLA) junior squad in 1998 but four years later was effectively dropped when he was not promoted from the junior to senior roster of the USLA. Because he had an American father and English mother, it was suggested he should apply to join the British luge team. He did and was accepted by them and started competing as a senior with the GB squad in the 2003/04 season. Rosen competed in the first of three Olympics in 2006 and finished a creditable 16th, two places higher than his best ever finish in the World Cup the previous year. His sixth-place finish at Calgary in the 2008/09 World Cup was the best ever finish by a British luger. It was achieved on the same track the movie “Cool Runnings” was based on. Rosen finished 16th again at the Vancouver Winter Games in 2010 but failed to qualify for Sochi in 2014. He returned for the 2018 PyeongChang Games but could only finish 22nd and “A. J.” announced his retirement shortly afterwards. Before taking up Luge, Rosen, described as a music entrepreneur, played football for New Rochelle High School, from which he graduated in 2002. Also keen on flying, he flew solo in a Cessna 172 at the age of 16 and after High School was accepted for a place at the Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University at Daytona Beach, Florida, but he turned it down and chose to train for the 2006 Winter Olympics instead.

From 1931, when he made his cricket first XI début at the age of 15, he played 108 consecutive matches for the school at the three sports. After Rugby, Walford went to Trinity College, Oxford, where he became a triple Blue in his three favourite sports. During his time at University, he twice had trials for the England rugby XV and, despite not getting selected, often travelled with the team as a reserve. A fellow three-quarter at Oxford was the famous “Flying Russian Prince”, Alex Obolensky who, in 1935, scored probably the greatest try ever seen at Twickenham, for England against the All Blacks. An England hockey international on 17 occasions, many as captain, Walford won a silver medal with the Great Britain team at the 1948 London Olympics. It was as a cricketer, however, that Walford was better known, and between 1935-53 he played 97 First Class matches for Oxford University and Somerset. He scored 5,327 First Class runs, with a highest score of 264, against Hampshire in 1947. Had his Somerset appearances not been restricted to school holidays, as he was a schoolteacher at Sherborne School, he would surely have been called up to the England team. After ending his playing days at Somerset, Walford returned to Minor Counties cricket. Having played for Durham in 1937, he then spent nine seasons with Dorset until retiring in 1962. In 1955, when aged 39, Walford became the first Minor Counties cricketer since 1911 to score 1,000 runs in a season. After his cricketing days, he took to the more sedate pastime of sailing.","Listed in Olympians Who Played First-Class Cricket (Played 97 First Class matches (Oxford University, Surrey))"

23355,Robert Lips,Male,21 August 1912,,, Switzerland,SUI,"Swiss painter and cartoonist Robert Lips participated in the Art Competitions of the 1936 Berlin and the 1948 London Olympics. He also participated in London as a fencer, finishing fifth in team epée and being eliminated in the second round of the individual epée. He was nominated as a fencer in 1936, but was unable to compete due to injury. At only 19-years-old, as an architecture student, Lips was happy to win a 1931 poster competition from the Globus department store, but he had not dreamed when he developed the comic character “Globi” that it would later become a best selling Swiss comic. The comic survived him, and many generations of children still enjoy it, with more than 9 million copies having been sold. The first picture stories appeared in 1934 in the Globe Magazine of the Globus department stores, and they were later continued in the “Globi” picture stories. In addition to being a cartoonist, Lips also worked as a painter, although this was less well known. Robert Lips’ oil paintings submitted in 1936 could be clearly identified by the illustration in the catalog and by a photo from the exhibition hall, respectively. Quite confusing is the information on the homepage of the artist that a consignment note of the Berlin art exhibition can been found on the verso of the painting La Croix d’Ouchy. This painting shows the Crucifixion, so without any reference to sports. The attribution of the other drawings and graphic prints, however, is ambiguous. A number of drawings from this period are known. In the 1936 catalog, however, they are simply listed as Drawing (I to VI). The posters, too, were perhaps only general sketches and could not be assigned to any particular event. Posters for topics of swimming and athletics were printed in 1942, possibly based on the submitted designs. In 1948, Lips was represented once again with three charcoal drawings. Here, too, the assignment is uncertain, since there are usually several drawings of the respective motifs. Altogether, Lips entered 16 works, 13 in 1936 and 3 in 1948.",

After winning his first of seven French titles in the 110 m hurdles in 1970 (others won in 1971-73, 1975-76, 1980), he decided to concentrate on the high hurdles. Drut first competed internationally at the 1970 European Indoor Championships, where he won bronze in the 60 m hurdles, before competing at the 1971 Mediterranean Games, where he won gold in the 110 hurdles. He then won gold in 50 m hurdles at the European Indoor Championships, before finishing second at the 1972 München Olympics. At the 1974 European Championships, Drut won gold, repeating that victory at the 1976 Montréal Olympics. His last international tournament was the 1981 European Indoor Championships, where he won a bronze medal in the 50 m hurdles. After retirement from sports, Drut became active in business and politics. He was a member of the French Parliament from 1986-2007, served as Minister of Youth and Sports from 1995-97, and was also mayor of Coloummiers from 1992-2008. In 2005, Drut was tried on charges of allegedly holding fictitious jobs between 1990 and 1992 to fund his political party. He always maintained his innocence and was granted amnesty by French President Jacques Chirac in 2006.

With all skaters using the new material at the 1998 Olympics, she was not a top favourite in Nagano. To everybody’s surprise — including her own — she broke the World Record in the 1500 m to win the gold, and took a second title in the 1000 meter. The Nagano rink proved lucky for Timmer, as it is also the site of her only World Sprint title. Eight years after her success, Timmer was considered an outsider for a medal in the 1000 m. Motivated by a disqualification in the 500 m (due to a disputed false start), Timmer narrowly beat pre-race favorites Cindy Klassen and Anni Friesinger. Aiming for a fourth Olympics, her career appeared finished when she suffered a severe heel injury due to an opponent’s fall in late 2009. Timmer was briefly married to her 1998 coach, 1976 Olympic champion Peter Mueller. She is presently married to Henk Timmer, a football goalkeeper for the Dutch national team.
