74926,Armando Cortesão,Male,31 January 1891,,, Portugal,POR,"Armando Cortesão worked as an agronomic engineer, a colonial administrator, and a historian of Portuguese cartography. Cortesão graduated from the Instituto Superior de Agronomia in 1913, as an agronomist, before becoming the head of the Department of Agriculture of São Tomé and Príncipe from 1916 to 1920. During this time, he co-authored a map of the area, with his cartography being used on further studies of ancient maps. In 1919, Cortesão headed up the Ministry of Colonies, spending most of his time in West Africa, where he wrote two books. He worked at the General Agency for the Colonies until 1931, until he was no longer in favour with the Portuguese government under António de Oliveira Salazar. This resulted in Cortesão fleeing the country (through a spectacular escape, swimming across the river Minho, to Spain, after knocking down the border official), living in exile for many years in Spain, England, and France, where he worked for UNESCO. During his exile, Cortesão wrote a book about Portuguese cartography and cartographers of the 15th and 16th centuries, which was his best work. Cortesão returned to Portugal only in 1952, becoming a professor of Studies in Ancient Cartography at the University of Coimbra. From 1960 to 1962, he published a six-volume work of cartographic monuments of Portugal, which included multiple high-quality lithographs. Cortesão was bestowed with multiple honours during his lifetime, including the Grand Officer of the Military Order of Christ (1930), the Grand Cross of the Order of Prince Henry (1961), and an Honoris Causa doctorate from the University of Coimbra (1961). In 1987, he was posthumously awarded with the Grand Cross of the Military Order of Saint James of the Sword. Cortesão’s athletics career was a small footnote in his remarkable life, with him competing in the 400 and 800 metres at the 1912 Stockholm Olympics. In the 400 metres, he finished in last place in his heat and did not qualify for the semi-finals. He fared marginally better in the 800 metres, where he finished second in his heat, but he did not get past the semi-finals. He was the Portuguese national champion in the 200 metres in 1913, and in the 800 metres from 1911-13, among other disciplines. Personal Bests: 400 - unknown; 800 – 2:13.4 (1913).",

2000580,Walter Woodburn Hyde,Male,4 May 1870,,, United States,USA,"Walter Woodburn Hyde studied Ancient History at Cornell University until 1893. He then taught Latin and history at schools in Westerly, Rhode Island and Northampton, Massachusetts. At the latter, he was appointed principal in 1899. In the meantime, he had also spent a year at the American Schools of Classical Studies in Athina and Roma. From 1900-02 he again went to Europe and continued his studies at the universities of Genève, Göttingen, and Halle. At Halle, Hyde completed his doctorate thesis titled De Olympionicarum statuis a Pausania commemorates (On the Olympic Statues Mentioned by Pausanias). After his return to the United States, Hyde taught Latin in Baltimore. From 1908 he lectured as professor of Latin at the University of Tennessee and then as professor of Greek at his alma mater, Cornell University. In 1910 Hyde changed over to the University of Pennsylvania as professor of Greek and Ancient History, where he held the chair for 30 years until his retirement. Since his studies in Halle, Hyde had been interested in the Ancient Olympic Games. In Philadelphia he researched the archaeology, philology, literature, religion, geography, and law of the ancient world. During his life Hyde published 14 monographs and 160 essays. The University of Pennsylvania awarded him the title of Doctor of Letters in 1948. An avid mountaineer, he reconstructed, among other things, Hannibal’s route across the Alps marching towards Roma. The only book with the title History of Olympic Games, Ancient and Modern that could be identified was first published in 1931 in the run-up to the 1932 Olympic Games in Los Angeles. The author was Hugh Harlan, who is not mentioned anywhere else in connection with the Olympic Games or as a book author. Hugh Valentine Harlan (1889-1964) was an American journalist who lived in California and it is possible that he acted as a ghostwriter for Hyde. The first edition of the book was 10,000 copies, the second edition, after the book was promoted by the USOC, had 50,000 copies.",

Both then went on to become top class ice hockey defencemen, but it was at football that the Syme family had a fine tradition. The sibling’s father Jock played for Raith Rovers, while Jock’s brother Robert played for Manchester City, Burnley and Dunfermline Athletic, and a cousin, Charlie Fleming, played for East Fife, Sunderland and Scotland. Having taken up ice hockey at the same time that he started work, Tuck was invited to join the Dunfermline Royals in 1945, when he was 16, and the following year, they won the Scottish Junior title. He broke into senior hockey with the Dunfermline Vikings in 1947 and the following year was playing in the Olympic Games at the age of 19. Upon selection for the Olympic Games, his employers, the National Coal Board, made a short promotional film about him. In the 1948/49 season Tuck played in Canada with the Guelph Baltimores but, feeling homesick, returned to Scotland and the Vikings, and helped them win the Canada Cup in the 1950/51 season, and Autumn Cup in 1952/53. Both Tuck and Tiny played for Great Britain at the 1950 World Champs when Britain finished fourth. After the Vikings folded, Tuck and Tiny joined the Paisley Pirates and Tuck was made team captain. It was rare for a non-Canadian to get such an honour in those days. The siblings helped Paisley to the League title, Autumn Cup and Canada Cup in their first season with them, 1953-54. His 8-season senior ice hockey career in Scotland, saw him play 380 games and score 133 points (46 goals and 87 assists). In 1954 Syme had another crack at playing in Canada, spending one season with the Val d’Or Miners, where his wages of $50 per week entailed playing hockey and working underground in a goldmine. He ended his playing days shortly afterwards, but stayed in Canada and got a job as a policeman on the Canadian Pacific Railroad. In 1960 he moved to California, where he died in 2011. He was inducted into the Scottish Ice Hockey Hall of Fame in 2005.",Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the European Ice Hockey Championships (0–1–0 1950 London silver)

He came under the influence of the Futurists in 1925, and devoted his life popularizing this style. He was especially involved in the Aeropittura, the painting of Perspectives of Flight (“The changing perspectives of flight constitute an absolutely new reality that has nothing in common with the reality traditionally constituted by a terrestrial perspective”). Because this movement was favored by the Fascist government it was later mistrusted and fell into oblivion. He also designed stage sets and made architectural designs. After World War II he worked in Torino, the UK and Paris and became a professor in Cairo for five years. From 1966 he worked for the Futurism Museum in Milano. Crali presented his paintings Lotta greco-romana and Lotta libera at the 2nd National Sports Exhibition. As a result, both works were selected for the art competitions of the 1936 Olympic Games.

Like many young girls in her position, she joined fashionable London Society at the Prince’s Skating Rink in Knightsbridge, but unlike most of her contemporaries, Madge took her skating seriously and it was through the sport that she met her future husband, Edgar Syers. Syers, who was 19 years her senior, wielded a considerable influence on Madge Caves development as a skater. He encouraged her to forsake the outdated “English” style with its minimal body movement, and in which she had won the 1899 Challenge Shield, and adopt the free and flowing “International’ style of skating. Madge Caves soon became the world’s leading woman skater. She won the first British pairs competition in 1899 with her future husband. The following year Madge and Edgar Syers were married and soon afterwards they finished second in one of the first international pairs competitions in Berlin. Although the newly married couple was a formidable combination in pairs competitions, it was in individual events that Madge Syers really shone. As there was no rule prohibiting women from competing, she created a sensation by entering the World Championships in 1902 where – even more sensationally – she finished second to the great Ulrich Salchow of Sweden. The authorities immediately barred women from the championships, but in 1905 the ban was rescinded and the following year a separate ladies’ event was introduced at the world championships. Madge easily won this event in 1906 and 1907, but it was not until 1920 that these events were retroactively recognized as official world championships. She also won the first British singles championship in 1903, finishing ahead of Horatio Torromé, and in 1904 she defeated her husband to retain the title. With this record, Madge Syers was a clear favorite for the 1908 Olympic women’s singles and with all five judges placing her a clear first in both the compulsory figures and the free skating, she was an undisputed winner of the gold medal. She also won a bronze medal partnering her husband in the pairs event. After the 1908 Olympics, Madge Syers, who was also a prize winning swimmer, shotgun expert and equestrienne, retired because of ill health and she died at the early age of 35.",Wife of Edgar Syers Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the World Figure Skating Championships (2–1–0 1902 London silver: singles; 1906 Davos gold: singles; 1907 Wien gold: singles)

For these feats, she was awarded the first Velma Springstead Trophy as Canada’s outstanding female athlete of the year. After setting five Canadian records at the 1935 national championships, she was selected for Canada’s delegation to the 1936 Summer Olympics and entered into three events: the 100 and 400 m individual freestyle tournaments and the 4x100 m freestyle relay, the latter with Pirie, Mary McConkey, and Margaret Stone. The nation’s high hopes were dashed, however, when Dewar came down with the flu in Berlin; she was eliminated in the semi-finals of the 100 m and was not even able to start in the 400 m. In the relay, the Canadians came in joint-fourth alongside the Hungarians.

After graduating in 1950, he joined the Royal Corinthian Yacht Club and began racing in several different classes. He was also a keen musician played the trombone in a jazz band in his days at the Corinthian Club. In 1968 he was selected, alongside Charles Reynolds and David Tucker, to represent Great Britain in the Dragon class at the Mexico City Olympics, where he placed 14th among a field of 23 entrants after suffering a broken mast during the tournament. He later moved to Bermuda with his family, where he had a career in photography and became interested in art. His use of the camera cleverly created artistic images that were published, and an exhibition of a study of Bermudan roofs at London’s Ritz Gallery gave the impression they were abstract paintings and not photographs. Judah also enjoyed time playing golf in Bermuda and served as an international sailing judge. Sadly, the family’s happiness was shattered following the death of their eldest son. Judah found solace in returning to Burnham each summer to sail and play golf, but further tragedy struck with the death of their youngest son and Judah and his wife Sue subsequently returned to England. Robin suffered from dementia and died in a nursing home aged 91 in 2021, just two weeks after Sue suffered a stroke, which also claimed her life. In 1964, Judah and his wife lived next door to Sir Winston and Lady Churchill at Hyde Park Gate.",

Frinolli first wore the blue shirt of the Italian national team in 1961 and was a regular member of the Azzurri for more than a decade. He first came to international prominence in 1963 when he achieved victories at both the Universiade and the Mediterranean Games and ended the year ranked in the world’s top 10 by Track & Field News. He continued his progress the following year and led the Olympic final until he faded into sixth place in the second half of the race. In 1965 and 1966 he became established as the top 400m hurdler in the world, a fact he consolidated with a repeat win at the Universiade and a dominant win at the 1966 European Championships in Hungary, If Frinolli was not quite in the same form in 1968 he was still considered a medal prospect for the 1968 Olympic Games and more so when he set a national record in the semi-final. In a repeat of the final in Tokyo, Frinolli once again blazed his way In the early stages of the race and disputed the lead with Dave Hemery. This time he slowed down even more dramatically and was passed by the entire field over the last two hurdles. This effectively ended his career as a top line performer over the hurdles although he reappeared, with disappointing results, at one more Olympic Games before retirement. He became involved with the Italian national baseball team as fitness coach and later team manager before taking up the post of technical director of the men’s national track and field team from 2001-04 and was also the personal coach of Fabrizio Mori, 1999 world champion in the 400m hurdles. It was Mori who broke Frinolli’s national record after 23 years. Frinolli’s great rival in the early 60s was 1964 Olympic bronze medal winner Salvatore Morale. The two became brothers-in-law when each married one of the Beneck sisters, the Italian swimming Olympians of the same era. Roberto married Daniela Beneck while Morale married Anna Beneck. Roberto and Daniela’s two sons also represented Italy. Bruno was a long jumper and Giorgio followed his father as a hurdler and competed in the Sydney Olympics.

Fuchs, who rarely competed, barely made the 1908 Hungarian Olympic team by finishing eighth and securing the last place at the 1908 Hungarian Olympic trials, but at the Olympics, Fuchs won the gold medal with ease, losing only 2 of 22 bouts, and then led the Hungarian team to a gold medal in the team competition. After the 1908 Olympics, Fuchs stopped competing, instead concentrating on his law studies, graduating from the University of Budapest (now Eötvös Loránd University) with a doctor of law degree in 1911. He returned to fencing in 1912 and defended his Olympic individual sabre title with ease, winning 9 bouts, losing two and drawing one. Fuchs won his fourth Olympic gold in the 1912 team sabre event. Fuchs missed the 1920 Olympics as Hungary was not invited to the games as an aggressor nation in World War I, but he made the Hungarian 1924 Olympic team, although he did not compete, giving a younger teammate a chance. Fuchs also tried to make the 1928 Hungarian Olympic team, but past his prime, did not make it. Besides fencing, Fuchs was also known as a top ranked rower and bobsledder in Hungary. Fuchs ran his own attorney’s office and also worked with the Budapest stock market during World War II, for which he was considered indispensable. In 1944, however, he was forced to leave that job because of his Jewish ethnicity, after which the stock market crashed, and Fuchs survived to the end of the war in a Budapest ghetto. In February 1945 Fuchs was commissioned to create conditions to resume trading on the stock market. He was elected as Secretary-General of the Budapest Stock Exchange and successfully revived Hungarian stock trading. He continued in that activity until 1948 when the Soviets terminated the stock exchange.",

MacIver was the son of David MacIver, Member of Parliament (MP) for Birkenhead, and Kirkdale, Liverpool, and one of the founders of the Cunard Shipping Line. Sir Charles was educated at Harrow and Trinity College, Cambridge, from where he graduated in 1887. Upon leaving Cambridge, MacIver joined the family firm of steamship owners. MacIver started yacht racing at an early age and won prizes at many regattas around Britain. He went on to became a member of the Royal Yacht Squadron and many other leading yacht clubs, including the Royal Mersey Yacht Club and the Royal Clyde Yacht Club of which he was, at one time, the Commodore. It was also the home club of his rival Hera at the 1908 Olympics. MacIver acquired his 1908 Olympic entry Mouchette shortly before the Games, having enjoyed many successes with another 12-foot cutter, Eileen, in 1907. MacIver had two opportunities to race in the America’s Cup. The first was with one of Sir Thomas Lipton’s Shamrock’s, and again in 1934 with Sir Thomas Sopwith’s Endeavour. On both occasions, however, he could not make the trip to America. A former commanding office of the 9th Volunteer Battalion of the Cheshire Regiment, MacIver was knighted in 1920. Over the years he held some important posts and, apart from being a magistrate from 1909 up to the time of his death, he was High Sheriff of Anglesey, chairman of the Lancashire and Western Sea Fishery Joint Committee, on the council of the Yacht Racing Association, and the British representative on the International Yacht Racing Union.

He then became an English portrait and figure painter of the late romantic school with an eye to the Italian Renaissance. He also painted nudes, mythological figures and landscapes. Watson was quickly accepted and lauded in the artistic community of England. He won the Royal Academy School’s silver medals in 1889 and 1891, plus the Landseer Scholarship in 1892. His wife Hilda was a dancer and mime artist, while their daughter Mary Spencer Watson became a well-known sculptor. In the 1920s, Watson repeatedly took up the motif of the hunting goddess Diana in various techniques and styles. Since the information in the art competition catalog suggests an (oil) painting, it most likely was been the work Diana, the Huntress (oil on wood panel, 43.2 x 51.5 cm).",

Nevertheless, his career was only temporarily affected by the disaster. His works included also Chicago’s Drake Hotel, Edgewater Beach Hotel, South Shore Country Club, Blackstone Theater, and Blackstone Hotel.

The house, which was the scene of legendary parties, also provided working space for 45 architects. Additionally, the basement was home for the Sheridan Shore Yacht Club. The pink building offered a swimming pool, a garden loggia, an Egyptian and a Pompeian room, a stage for performances, and a Chinese pagoda.

He represented his College at football and hockey, and became a useful golfer and a better oarsman; but on the advice of his uncle Clement Jackson, a former holder of the world high hurdles record and the current Treasurer of the Oxford University, AC, Arnold took up running again. Even by the standards of that time, his training was extremely casual; but his natural talent was such that after winning the Oxford University AC mile in 1912, he won the mile against Cambridge in a respectable 4:21.6 seconds. On the strength of his performance alone, he was selected to represent Great Britain at the Olympic Games in Stockholm. In the Olympic 1,500 metres, seven of Britain’s nine entrants were eliminated in the heats and only Jackson and Philip Baker of Cambridge (later Lord Noel-Baker) qualified for the final. In comparison with the other finalists Jackson was a complete novice, but with his long raking stride he came through from seventh place down the home straight, overtaking among others, the American holder of the world mile record John Paul Jones and world record holder at 1,500 metres Abel Kiviat Jackson’s winning time of 3:56.8 seconds was a new British and Olympic record. On his return from Stockholm Jackson continued his running at Oxford, but although he was an Olympic champion and the British record holder he never even bothered to enter for the AAA Championships. He won again against Cambridge in 1913 and 1914, and in April 1914 he went to America and ran his last race at the Penn Relays, bringing the Oxford team home first in the 4×1 mile relay. So his brilliant track career ended after no more than half a dozen first-class races. In the war, Jackson served with the King’s Royal Rifle Corps and achieved distinctions which more than matched his sporting honors. He became the youngest Brigadier-General in the British Army, was Mentioned in Despatches six times and won the DSO and three Bars; only six other officers were similarly decorated. In 1919 he adopted Strode as an additional surname by deed poll and the change was registered at the College of Arms, but he retained Strode as a forename and was known as Arnold Nugent Strode Strode-Jackson. Before settling in America in 1921, he was a member of the British delegation to the Paris Peace Conference and was awarded the CBE for his services. He became an American citizen in 1945 but his last years were spent in England. Personal Bests: 1500 – 3:56.8 (1912); Mile – 4:21.4 (1912).",

He was educated in Europe where he played various sports and was one of the Americans chosen in 1928 to form a bobsled team. Fiske became famous as the driver of the two gold medal sleds, although he was only 16 years old when he won the 1928 gold medal. Later, on the toboggan run at St. Moritz, he became known as perhaps the greatest Cresta rider of all time. On the Cresta Run, he took the Grand National title in 1936 and 1938 and won the Curzon Cup in 1935 and 1937. Fiske worked in this country for a time, as an executive with a motion picture company, but he spent much of his time in Europe and Britain, where in 1938 he married the Countess of Warwick. Billy Fiske had many British friends and when war broke out, he felt it only right to fight alongside them. He joined the Royal Air Force in 1939, the first American to do so. In August 1940, on returning from a mission, he was shot but landed his plane, only to die a few hours later, and he is considered the first American to die in World War II. Fiske was laid to rest in England, at Boxgrove Priory, near Chichester. The epitaph on his grave reads, “An American citizen who died that England might live.” In his honor, the National AAU 4-man bobsled trophy was named the Billy Fiske Memorial Trophy.","Brother-in-law of Jennison Heaton Listed in Olympians Who Died in Aviation Crashes (First American fighter pilot to be killed in World War II, fighting for Britain, in a crash landing.)

90392,Bradley Wiggins,Male,28 April 1980,190.0,82, Great Britain,GBR,"Bradley Wiggins’ father, Australian-born Gary Wiggins, was a professional cyclist in the 1970s and 80s and was the 1984 European Madison champion with Britain’s Tony Doyle. Bradley was born in Belgium whilst his father was riding there, but at the age of two returned to England with his mother. He took an interest in cycling after watching Chris Boardman at the 1992 Barcelona Olympics, and shortly afterwards, joined his first cycling club. The world junior pursuit champion at 18, Wiggins then won the first of four Commonwealth Games silver medals as part of the England pursuit team. The others silvers were team and individual pursuit in 2002, and team pursuit in 2014. Wiggins went to his first Olympics at Sydney in 2000 and was in the pursuit team that beat the French to win the bronze medal. He then had a spell racing in France before returning to England and worked with Chris Boardman. Wiggins entered his first Grand Tour, the Giro d’Italia in 2003 and that same year won his first senior world title, when he won the individual pursuit at the World Championships in Stuttgart, having won two team silvers and a bronze in the three previous Worlds. He came away from the 2004 Olympics with a complete set of medals; bronze in the Madison, silver in the team pursuit and gold in the individual pursuit as he became the first Briton since athlete Mary Rand in 1964 to win three medals at one Olympics. In 2005 Wiggins went back to road racing and entered his first Tour de France, before reverting back to track racing in 2007 when he appeared in his first World Championships in four years, wining gold in both the team and individual pursuit in Mallorca. A year later, in the 2008 World Championships at Manchester, Wiggins won three gold medals; the individual and team pursuit and the Madison with Mark Cavendish, who was a late replacement for his regular Madison partner Rob Hayles. Wiggins then went to the Beijing Olympics where he won both pursuit gold medals, becoming the first man to successfully defend his individual title. Wiggins and Cavendish were favourites for the Madison gold medal but finished a disappointing ninth. In 2009, Wiggins decided once again that he wanted to concentrate on road racing and he moved with his family to northern Spain where his new team Garmin-Slipstream were based. After a series of good performances he then finished fourth overall in the 2009 Tour de France, equaling the best ever finish by a British rider. However, three years later, following Lance Armstrong’s disqualification, he was promoted to third place - Britain’s first podium finish in the Tour, albeit three years after he should have stood on the podium. At the end of the season he joined the Sky Team as their new team leader, but he struggled with fitness and form in his first full season with his new team. However, the 2011 season was better, and after breaking a collar bone following a crash in the Tour de France, he finished third in his first Vuelta de España. In 2012 Wiggins started off what was to be a memorable year by becoming the first Briton in the 65-year history of the Tour de Romandie to win the race and then won the Tour de France as the first ever British winner of the race in its 109-year history. Uniquely, Wiggins did something even the great Eddy Merckx could not achieve and that was win the Tour de France, Tour de Romandie, Paris-Nice and Critérium de Dauphiné in the same season. Wiggins followed his tour win with his record breaking seventh Olympic medal at the London Games, when he won the road time trial event – Chris Hoy was to equal Wiggins’ seven medals tally later in the Games. Wiggins was the first man ever to win the Tour de France and an Olympic gold medal in the same year. He never defended his Tour de France in 2013, but won a silver medal in the time trial at the World Championships, and won the Tour of Britain. The following year Wiggins won the World Championship time trial gold medal and in 2015 he broke the world hour record with a distance of 54.526 km, and then won his only European track gold medal as part of the British team pursuit team. The medals kept on coming in 2016 when he won a gold in the Madison at the World Championships in London, and a silver in the team pursuit. A few months later he took his Olympic total of gold medals to five when he won the team pursuit, but it also took his overall medal total to eight making him, jointly with swimmer Henry Taylor, the most decorated British Olympian. His eight medals was an all-time record for any Olympic cyclist until beaten by Jason Kenny in 2021. Bradley Wiggins has received many honours in recognition of his achievements. He received the OBE in the 2005, the CBE in 2009 and was Knighted in 2013 - an honour he felt very humble to receive. He was also the BBC Sports Personality of the Year for 2012. Away from cycling, Bradley is a big fan of Wigan Warriors Rugby League team, and also collects records, old guitars and classic scooters.",Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the British Empire/Commonwealth Games (0–4–0 1998 Kuala Lumpur CYC silver: 4000 m team pursuit (competed for England); 2002 Manchester CYC silver: 4000 m individual pursuit and 4000 m team pursuit (competed for England); 2014 Glasgow CYC silver: 4000 m team pursuit (competed for England)) Listed in Olympic Cycling Medalists and Tour de France Champions (2000-16 – 8 Olympic medals (5/1/2); 2012 Tour de France Champion) Listed in Olympian Members of the Nobility (Sir)

2725,Chris Evert,Female,21 December 1954,167.0,57, United States,USA,"Chris Evert played tennis at the 1988 Seoul Olympics, without distinction, but it was only a footnote to her career as one of the greatest women tennis players of all-time. At 15-years-old she was US 16-and-under Champion and went to the finals of a senior tournament in Charlotte, North Carolina. Evert first became known on an international scale when she went to the semi-finals of the 1971 US Open tournament, at age 16. In 1974 she won both the French Open and Wimbledon, while in 1975 she won the French and US Open titles. Evert would win a Grand Slam tournament every year from 1974-86, finishing with 18 Grand Slam singles titles, which included 7 French Opens, 6 US Opens, 3 Wimbledons, and 2 Australian Open titles. Her Grand Slam titles mark is third most all-time, trailing Steffi Graf and Serena Williams, and equal to the 18 won by Martina Navratilova. Evert, however, was runner-up at 16 Grand Slam tournaments, and her total of making 34 Grand Slam finals is the most all-time, man or woman. Overall, she won 157 professional singles tournaments, second all-time among women, trailing only Navratilova with 167. Evert also won four Grand Slam doubles titles, missing only the US Open, though she never emphasized doubles. Evert first became ranked #1 in singles in November 1975 and held that ranking for much of the next decade, usually ceding it only to Navratilova, her greatest rival and close friend. Stoic, with an icy demeanor on the court, giving her the nickname “The Ice Maiden,” Evert was a classic baseliner, who played right-handed with one of the earliest two-handed backhands. She was known to be especially difficult to beat on clay, which led to her winning seven French Opens. She retired after the US Open in 1989. Evert won the 1974 Wimbledon title while she was engaged to male tennis great Jimmy Connors, who also won Wimbledon that year; however, they never married. Evert did marry British tennis pro John Lloyd and competed as Chris Evert-Lloyd for a few years. They divorced and Evert later married US Olympic alpine skier Andy Mill, and she was entered at the 1988 Olympics as Evert-Mill. After that marriage ended, she had a brief marriage to Australian golf professional Greg Norman. After retiring in 1989, Evert has been most visible doing tennis commentary on ESPN at major championships.","Wife (divorced) of Andy Mill Listed in Olympians Who Were Named Sports Illustrated's Sportsman of the Year (Multiple Grand Slam titles, 1976 Sports Illustrated Sportsman of the Year) Listed in Olympians Who Were Awarded the Prix Monique Berlioux (1986) Listed in Olympians Who Were Named BBC World Sport Star of the Year (1981)"

She achieved this at the Athens Olympics in the 200 metre butterfly, without doubt her strongest distance. In that event, she has also won two world championships (2003 and 2005), four European titles (2000, 2002, 2004 and 2006) and three European short-course golds (2001, 2006-07).

She has also medalled in the 400 free at the Athens Games (silver), and won one Olympic and three World Championship medals in the 100 butterfly. After her golden race in Greece, Jędrzejczak auctioned off her medal, with the proceeds (some US$ 80,000) going to combat leukemia in the children’s hospital of Wrocław. Her career was brutally interrupted when she crashed her car into a tree during bad weather, killing her 19-year-old brother Szymon, who was also a swimmer. Refusing to take a suspended prison sentence, she was eventually convicted on appeal, and sentenced to community service and a suspension of her driving license. Although continuing to swim, her performances gradually declined, and she missed the finals in both major tournaments of 2008, the Europeans and the Olympics.

In 1956, 50 years after first competing in the Olympic fencing program, Britain finally won a gold medal due to the efforts of Gillian Sheen, a 28-year-old dental surgeon from University College Hospital, London. Sheen first took up the sport at North Foreland School in Kent and won the British Schoolgirls title in 1945, the British Junior Championship in 1947 and her first British senior title in 1949. On leaving school, she attended London University, winning the British Universities title for five years and a gold medal at the World Universities Championship in 1951. She made her Olympic début in 1952 and was eliminated in the second round but four years later in Melbourne she was the surprise winner of the gold medal. She edged into the final by defeating the world champion, Lídia Dömölky-Sákovics of Hungary, in a barrage to decide the fourth place in her semi-final pool. In the final Sheen lost her first bout to Olga Orban-Szabo of Romania but won her other six bouts to finish equal first with the Romanian. The gold medal was decided on a barrage between these two and, as Orban had already beating the English girl in the opening bout of the final pool, the Romanian started as favorite. However, Sheen quickly moved into a 3-1 lead and although Orban pulled back 3-2, in a decisive attack Sheen scored another hit to win 4-2. Gillian Sheen went on to win the British Empire and Commonwealth title in 1958 (in 1954 she finished second and in 1962 she finished fifth) and in 1960 she won her 10th and final British championship.

His first success came in 1914, winning the 400 metre freestyle at a high school tournament. In 1916, he and his brother were among the founders of the Hamana Bay Swimming Association. In the same year, Masayoshi won four titles (100 yds, 220 yds, 440 yds, and 1 mile freestyle) at the national championships at Iwabuchi, a record that still stands as of 2020. In 1917, Uchida represented Japan at the 3rd Far Eastern Games held in Tokyo, contributing to Japan’s sweep by winning the 220 yds and 880 yds, and was runner-up in the 100 yds. The Japan Sports Association did not take part in the 4th Far Eastern Games in Manila, but Uchida participated nevertheless representing the rival organization Japan Youth Sports Club. At the 1920 Olympics at Antwerpen the traditional Japanese style of freestyle swimming proved to be outdated and the Japanese swimmers failed to win a medal. After returning from Europe, Uchida became aware that training reforms and using the international style of crawl stroke were necessary to be competitive on an international level. He gave up his active career and established a swimming club at Hokkaido Imperial University to develop and promote swimming in Hokkaido. In 1921, he graduated from the Faculty of Agriculture and worked successively for a bank, a fish farm, and a seedling nursery. In 1932, Uchida emigrated to Argentina running a farm, and did not return until 1941. Subsequently he was employed as an engineer for saltwater treatment. He also cooperated with the Imperial Japanese Army, supporting independence movements against the British in Burma. In 1944, Uchida was appointed commander of New Guinea and died in the Sarmi mountains on the northwest coast of the island, where the remnants of the Japanese army had to retreat.",Listed in Olympians Who Were Killed or Missing in Action or Died as a Result of War (†1945.

He did not belong to any artistic circle, however he used techniques employed by groups active in Warszawa. From 1936, Trepkowski worked for the Institute of Social Affairs, for which he designed posters related to health and safety at work. During World War II, he interrupted his artistic activities and worked in a coal storage. In 1946-47, he was a correspondent for the Voice of the People at the Nuremberg Trials. In 1951, Trepkowski was artistic director in the editorial office of the weekly newspaper Świat for a short time. He belonged to the first generation of artists of the Polish poster school. At the age of 40, he suddenly died of a heart attack. Trepkowski designed political and social posters as well as posters for movies, sport and other events. His works were characterized by their special conciseness. He limited himself to expressive symbols and reduced texts, completely doing without people. In the last years of his life, he was criticized for deviating from the principles of socialist realism. He was also involved in organizing exhibitions and producing graphics for the press. His most famous work is the anti-war poster Nie! from 1952, created on the occasion of the Vienna Congress of Nations for the Defense of Peace, now in the collection of the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in New York. In 1954, Trepkowski was made a Knight of the Order of Polonia Restituta. Since 1955, a prize for young graphic artists bears his name. Trepkowski designed his poster for the Art Exhibition of the Olympic Games in Helsinki as a gouache in 1952, which was used for the poster for the Sports Games of the Youth Festival in Warszawa in 1955.",

He designed the largest stone monument of the time, erected in Meaux (France). His second wife was his former student, Alice Jones (1875-1963), sister of tennis players Marion and Georgina Jones, who had participated in the 1900 Olympic Games. MacMonnies died of pneumonia after having run into financial difficulties in the 1929 stock market crash. In 1924 he was a member of the jury of the art competitions. Although MacMonnies was best known for his monumental works, he also created small sculptures and medals. In 1932 he won the silver medal with his Lindbergh Medal in the Category Medals and Reliefs within the sculpturing competition at the Los Angeles Games. The medal was commissioned by the Society of Medalists in 1931 without specifying a specific topic. The artist chose Charles Lindbergh’s transatlantic flight in May 1927. The front shows a portrait of the aviator, the back shows a lone eagle (inscription “Lone Eagle”) fighting storms and lightning and the defated figure of death. The gold-plated bronze medal has a diameter of 7.3 cm. There was, however, a version with a diameter of only 3.2 mm.",Brother-in-law of Georgina Jones Brother-in-law of Marion Jones

Unfortunately like all the other Mexican athletes, he returned home without a medal. After the Olympics, Escutia was one of the founder members of the Club Deportivo Zitácuaro, which gave the opportunity for local people to participate in a wide range of sports, not just athletics. In 1925 he began teaching in the city of Toluca as a professor of Physical Education in the Military Institute of the State of Mexico.

He won Canada’s Henley Royal Regatta in 1949, ahead of Bob Williams. It was not until he was nearly 40 that he began to pursue skiing, after a trip to Whistler, British Columbia, years before it became a popular ski venue and he became one of several leading figures of his generation to help develop the site and the sport. For many years he worked as a ski teacher and for a time was the director of the Canadian Ski Association, which later became Alpine Canada.

30180,Frank Turner,Male,5 November 1922,,, Great Britain,GBR,"A Londoner by birth, Frank Turner showed prowess in a number of different sports as a youngster and gained honours in table tennis, diving, football and boxing as well as gymnastics. He ever reached the semi-finals of the flyweight division of the Amateur Boxing Association Championship before concentrating solely on his gymnastic career. Turner had shown his talent at an early age by winning the South of England Boys Championship at the age of eleven and made his international debut at the age of fifteen in 1938 but the war years robbed him of the chance of an Olympic debut until the Games arrived in his hometown in 1948. Formed at short notice and with having little experience of international competition the British were lucky to come under the tutelage of future Olympic champion Helmut Bantz, still a prisoner of war in England, who acted as an unofficial coach to the team. Four times a British all-around champion (1949-51 & 1953) he went to three Olympic Games as a competitor and added a fourth in 1960 when he was head coach to the British team. Turner gained a degree in sports science in 1964 and became a lecturer in the subject at Watford College of Technology and Dulwich Public College well into the 21st century. He also worked in the movies and in television as a double for actors required to perform gymnastic stunts.",

Harry Llewellyn, Ted Edgar, David Broome and Alan Oliver became family names, but it was the rivalry between the girls Pat Smythe and Dawn Palethorpe that gripped the public’s imagination. The daughter of Jack Palethorpe, a member of the famous Palethorpe pie and sausage empire, Dawn learned to ride a pony before she could walk. She was also a fine swimmer and tennis player, thanks largely to the spacious family home having a tennis court and indoor swimming pool. Her father was a keen all-round sportsman who enjoyed the winter sports of ice hockey and skiing, and was also a keen yachtsman, polo player and hunter. Dawn joined the Pony Club when she was two and at 15 was runner-up at the Leading Junior Show Jumper of the Year event in 1951. She switched from ponies to horses in 1953 and the following year was the Ladies National champion and was also the leading Showjumper of the Year on Holywell Surprise. Her next horse was to be Earlsrath Rambler and so was born one of the great partnerships of British show jumping. The pair won the Queen Elizabeth II Cup at the Royal International Horse Show in both 1955 and 1956. They also won the puissance at Aachen in 1955 and the following year were reserves for the British team at the Stockholm Olympics which is where she met her future husband Warren Wofford, the son of Colonel John Wofford, the first president of the US equestrian team. Warren and Dawn married the following year. After Earlsrath Rambler retired her next horse was her husband’s former horse Hollandia and they represented Britain at the Rome Olympics and won a silver medal at the European Women’s Championships at Copenhagen a few months before the Games. Shortly afterward the Olympics she retired from competitive jumping to raise her family. She remained involved with the Pony Club and was in 1991 appointed its first female chairman. In 1992 she re-wrote the Pony Club’s “Bible” - Manual of Horsemanship, which was quite an achievement for somebody who struggled to read and write at school because of dyslexia. She trained as a music teacher and had a love of music and opera. She was also a clever bridge player and expert shot, and after Warren’s death in 1997 she took up hunting again in her sixties. Dawn’s sister Jill was also a show jumper and like Dawn, won the Queen Elizabeth II Cup (then the Princess Elizabeth Cup) as a 17-year-old in 1950.",Sister-in-law of Jimmy Wofford Sister-in-law of John E.

15674,John Millman,Male,4 August 1930,,, Canada,CAN,"John Millman’s family was from Vancouver, but he was born in Portland while his parents were there looking for work during the Great Depression, and did not come to Canada until the age of three. He took up cycling in 1946, but had taken an interest in the sport well before he began practicing it. He had his first encounter at the age of nine in Vancouver, when he witnessed a race was organized in honour of a visit from the King and Queen and Millman and was fascinated by the winner’s speed. He watched his next race two years later and then, while working as a telegram messenger boy after school in 1945, came across a meeting discussing the revival of the Vancouver Cycle Club and was finally persuaded to take up the sport. Millman began racing in high school, but a serious skiing accident in December 1946 slowed his development. By the time he entered the University of British Columbia (UBC), in 1948, he had decided that he would specialize in the sprint rather than road racing. He came in second in the provincial trials for that year’s London Olympics, behind Lorne Atkinson, but opted not to travel to the national trials, believing that he would not be selected. After winning his first national titles in 1949, Millman then won the sprint trials for the 1950 British Empire Games. During 1949 he worked to earn money to support his training in the warmer climate of California prior to this tournament. At the 1950 British Empire Games, Millman defeated New Zealand’s Don Olive in the heats of the 1000 metres sprint, but then lost after Olive requested a re-run. Olive claimed that his tire was “soft” and, in the re-match, forced Millman to swerve, at speed, dangerously. Millman did, however, defeat Atkinson in British Columbia’s famous Province Race later that year and defend his Canadian title in the sprint. After racing in a six-day race in the United States and working on a tobacco farm, he returned to UBC in October to complete his pre-medical degree. By summer 1951, however, Millman was back to working odd jobs to save money in order to pay his university fees and keep. His training took a back seat to his studies for the first half of the year, but he resumed in the winter so that he could compete in the Canadian Olympics Trials for the 1952 Games. He won both the sprint and the 1000 metre time trials in March 1952, but gave his spot in the latter event to runner-up Frederick Henry. In Helsinki, Millman was eliminated in the quarterfinals repêchage of the sprint. He also competed at that year’s UCI Track Cycling World Championships, but did not reach the final after some controversial judging decisions. He won his quarterfinal repêchage, but the judges mistook him for another rider and, despite support from that rider, Millman was not permitted to advance. He then returned to Canada, completed his degree in Zoology and Psychology, enrolled in UBC’s medical school, got married, and had a daughter. Millman’s cycling career, however, was not yet over. He finished second in the sprint trials for the 1954 British Empire and Commonwealth Games and competed in the 10-mile scratch race at that tournament without reaching the podium. After dropping out of medical school, he competed in the 1955 North American Championship and won the sprint, but refused to re-run the race after American Jack Disney protested the result. When a film of the final was reviewed, however, it was determined that Millman’s victory had been legitimate and he was therefore crowned North American champion. Millman then sought to turn professional, although a bout with gastroenteritis delayed his début and changed his home base from Milano to Paris (where the track ended up being closed due to a Winter Circus), Antwerp, and eventually England. After a second round of illness, this time with superficial punctate keratitis, he had not yet raced as a professional and was therefore eligible to compete at the 1956 Melbourne Olympics, but was unable to afford to travel to Montreal to compete in the trials. His first marriage soon ended and his second one began, and he returned to Edmonton to work with the Alberta provincial government, forgoing a professional cycling career, as he felt that his form had fallen off. He earned a master’s degree in Psychology in 1964 and then returned to London, where he earned a PhD in 1970. He later worked in psychopharmacology at the University of Newcastle.",

Spinks was a brawler from the word go. He had won the 1975 AAU title and lost in the finals of the 1975 Pan American Games. At the Montreal Olympics he seemed awkward in comparison to the polished Europeans and Cubans, but he won all his bouts with ease, knocking out the Cuban world champion, Sixto Soria, in the finals. Spinks turned pro as soon as he returned to the United States. He put on a few pounds and began fighting as a heavyweight. On 15 February 1978, after only seven pro fights, he took on Muhammad Ali for the heavyweight title, and upset him. In September of 1978, Ali again fought Spinks and regained the title, but in a close, controversial decision. Spinks’ reign as heavyweight champion was the shortest in history – 212 days. Leon Spinks was small for a heavyweight. In the late 70s a new class was formed for fighters like him – the cruiserweight division. Leon Spinks continued to box professionally and made an attempt to win the cruiserweight championship, but never matched his early professional success. He fought until 1995, but was a punching bag later in his career, ending it with a record of 26 wins, 17 losses, and 3 draws. Spinks suffered financial troubles after his retirement and, after a brief spell as a professional wrestler, lived in a shelter for the homeless. He later became a janitor at a YMCA in Columbus, Nebraska where he was reported as suffering from dementia.

He graduated from the University of Sydney in 1910 and was awarded the Rhodes Scholarship, then studying at New College, Oxford, where he earned diplomas in anthropology and public health. He also rowed for Oxford in 1913 and 1914. During World War I Ward served in the Royal Army Medical Corps Special Reserve, becoming regimental medical officer of the 2nd Battalion, King’s Royal Rifle Corps. He was wounded in action several times and in 1916 won the Military Cross for showing “an utter contempt for danger” while attending to wounded men. Taken prisoner at Nieuport, Belgium, in June 1917, he was released in March next year. He was gassed at Arras, France, but continued to serve. For his repeated acts of gallantry he was awarded two Bars to his M.C. and twice mentioned in despatches. After the War, Ward continued experimental work at Oxford but in 1923-24 he was awarded a Rockefeller Foundation fellowship and studied in the department of bacteriology and immunology at Harvard University in the USA. He briefly returned to Oxford but returned to Harvard in 1926, joining the staff of Hans Zinsser to study infectious diseases. He mentored John F. Enders in researching infectious diseases and Enders would win the Nobel Prize in Medicine in 1954 for his study of the poliomyelitis virus. Ward returned to Australia in 1935 and became Bosch professor of bacteriology at the University of Sydney. He was a founding member in 1936 of the National Health and Medical Research Council. Ward chaired the Australian National Research Council in 1952-53 and helped smooth its transfer in 1954 to the newly formed Australian Academy of Science. He also served on the interim council (1948-51) and the council (1951-53) of the Australian National University. Hugh Ward retired from the University of Sydney in 1952 and from 1952-69 was a medical officer with the Red Cross Blood Transfusion Service.

At the age of just 18, he became a soldier in World War I and was severely wounded at Verdun. After the war, he studied at fine arts academies in München, Karlsruhe, and Berlin. Heinsheimer created paintings on World War I, landscapes, portraits, and sports images (boxers, runners, high jumpers, and cyclists). In 1931, he travelled to Java in the Dutch East Indies and was inspired to paint images of exotic worlds. He was Protestant, but of Jewish descent, and was banned from working in 1933, although he was still able to use his studio. In 1942 Heinsheimer fled to Brittany and then survived in Paris as “Alsatian” under the pseudonym “Fernand Husser”. The works that he had to leave behind in Germany were all lost. After the war, he lived and worked in Wiesbaden. His later works were barely influenced by the developments in international art and embraced the melancholic landscapes of Southwest Germany. The oil painting on canvas (75 x 98.5 cm) Eishockey (Ice Hockey Match) from 1928 shows a scene from the match of the Canadian Olympic team against the Berlin Skating Club in the Berlin Sportpalast. The lithograph of the same title depicts a scene of the Berlin club against the Cambridge University team, which met, among other events, several times at the Spengler Cup during this period.

The academy, however, moved to its final location only in 1932. It consisted of two symmetrical two-story buildings connected by a wide bridge to form an H-shaped structure. The white of the marble in the posts and frames stands in contrast to the Pompeian-red background of the plaster. Despite the classic appearance, the structure consisted of a reinforced concrete frame and filler walls. A large foundation foot elevated the building 5 meters above the natural level to surmount the highest point of the Tiber. The complex was designed by architect Enrico Del Debbio and construction commenced in 1927. It comprised the Foro Mussolini, now Foro Italico (completed in 1960), the Stadio dei Marmi and the Palazzo della Farnesina, the current home of the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. For the 1960 Olympics, he added a swimming stadium. Enrico Del Debbio (26 May 1881 in Carrara – 12 July 1973 in Roma) was an architect and lecturer at the Faculty of Architecture in Rome 1922-1962.",

47250,George Dockrell,Male,22 October 1886,,, Great Britain,GBR,"George Dockrell was regarded as Ireland’s greatest ever swimmer. He was the son of Sir Maurice Dockrell, a renowned businessman and politician in the Irish Free State, serving as an MP for South Dublin in Westminster from 1918-22. George was just one member of the famous Irish swimming family. His brother Henry was also an Irish champion while Henry’s children Marguerite and Hayes both competed at the 1928 Olympics. George was also in Irish international water polo player. Dockrell was educated at Trent College, Nottingham, and whilst there won virtually every swimming competition he entered. At the age of 17 he competed in his first Irish Championship, and the following year went to the United States where he joined the New York Athletic Club and learned to develop the crawl style as used by Charlie Daniels. Dockrell returned to Ireland in 1906 and went to Trinity College Dublin. Between 1906-11 he contested 27 Irish Championships and won 20 freestyle titles, winning the 220 yards title six times, the 100 and 440 yards five times each, and the 880 on four occasions. At the time of his death in 1924 he held three Irish records, one dating back to 1907. He was the first Irishman to swim 100 yards in exactly 60 seconds and at Dublin in 1911 he set a British native record of 58.6 for the 100. He never won an ASA title but finished second in the 100 free in 1908 and third in the 200 in 1911. However, his finest moment came at an international meeting at Paris in 1909 when he beat Herman Meyboom of Belgium, the man who beat Dockrell into second place in the 1908 ASA. Dockrell was reaching his peak leading up to the 1912 Olympics and was expected to make the squad but was not selected for Stockholm. However, it was around this time that things start to go badly for Dockrell. Having previously worked in the Dublin family business of Thomas Dockrell Sons and Co., he left to go to work on his own account in London in September 1912 and the following Spring appeared at a bankruptcy hearing when it was established that over the previous couple of years, he had amassed heavy gambling losses. However, he turned his life around, and at the start of World War I in 1914, signed up for the Rifle Brigade. However, less then 12 months later he received a severe back injury after being hit by shrapnel. Dockrell was subsequently promoted to staff captain in 1917 and to major in 1919. He was honoured with the OBE, and was demobilised in 1920. George Shannon Dockrell died at the Officers’ Hospital, Richmond, Surrey in 1924.",Uncle of Marguerite Dockrell Uncle of Hayes Dockrell

921598,Alexander Proctor,Male,27 September 1860,,, United States,USA,"Born in Canada and raised in Colorado, Alexander Proctor was a genuine Westerner whose love of the American wilderness – social and natural history – never left him. Although he dubbed himself the “sculptor in buckskin,” Proctor’s academic training made him as comfortable in international artistic circles as he was hunting grizzlies in the Rocky Mountains. He studied at the Art Students’ League and the National Academy of Design in New York City, and later at the Académies Julien and Colarossi in Paris, where he learned to translate his keen observations into works of art that memorialized the West without sentimentality. Proctor dedicated his life to creating monumental statues throughout the United States and made his smaller bronzes available to the general public. His works of art celebrate both famous heroes and anonymous, iconic figures. He mainly worked on life-sized wild animal sculptures. Proctor’s genius in depicting animals can be seen in the Tigers in front of Princeton University’s Nassau Hall. The Animal House in New York’s Zoological Gardens showcases his monkeys, elephants, rhinoceros and frogs on its frieze. Lions flank Pittsburgh’s Frick Building, and four Buffalo guard the Q Street Bridge in Washington, D.C. His last monumental commission was Mustangs, which resides on the campus of the University of Texas at Austin. His bronze statue of the Broncho Buster was created in 1920 and is located in Civic Center Park in Denver, and is one of two statues that Proctor created for this park. The reference in the art catalog notes that the exhibited version was on loan from George Dupont Pratt (1869-1935), a wealthy hunting companion of the artist, proves that it was actually the 72 cm high sculpture Buckaroo, created in 1914 and cast in bronze in 1915. Proctor then enlarged it for the Broncho Buster. One of three copies owned by Pratt came to the Metropolitan Museum in New York in 1935 as part of his legacy to the museum.",

Fairbanks also played rugby for Clifton and was a founder member of the Bristol and Clifton Golf Club in 1891, and was club captain from then until 1896. After leaving Cambridge, Fairbanks returned to his old school as a house master from 1875-96, after which time he went to live in the United States, before eventually settling in Denver, Colorado in 1898. Fairbanks continued playing golf and was a member of the Denver Country Club and won the first of 10 club championships in 1899 at the age of 47. He also won the Colorado State Match-play Championships four years in succession 1902-05 and was the Southern California champion on three occasions.

His best finish in the US Amateur Championship was in reaching the last 16 in 1899 and after beating J. F. Curtis 1-up after 40 holes in his first round match, he acquired the nickname “40-holes Fairbanks.” Fairbanks’ greatest moment in golf came beyond his 60th birthday, when he won the 1913 United States Senior Golf Association Championship at New York, the same year that the amateur Francis Ouimet sensationally won the US Open. Fairbanks became a director of the Denver Country Club in 1903 and was still a club member at the time of his death, four months after returning to England in to stay with his sister in Surrey in 1924.",

At the Académie Julian, Péchaubes was a student of Édouard Detaille and later exhibited in numerous salons. He painted numerous finishes of major horse races.

After winning his first two Olympic bouts he lost a close decision in the quarter-final. Eight weeks later he made his debut in the professional ranks and within six months was a top-ranked contender for the International Boxing Federation version of the world bantamweight title. In only his seventh fight he was matched against Satoshi Shiungaki for the world title and dominated en route to a ninth round technical knockout. Over the next four years Fenech proved himself to be one of the stars of world boxing and added world crowns at super-bantamweight and featherweight to his collections. One of his victims during this time was Steve McCrory of the USA who took the Olympic title that Fenech had aspired to in L.A. After 24 successive wins Fenech retired at the start of 1990 due in the main part to a series of hand injuries. He briefly played semi-professional rugby but returned to the ring in 1991 and lost his perfect record via a draw with veteran Ghanaian Azumah Nelson. His first defeat came in a rematch against Nelson in 1992 and after another stoppage defeat he again retired. A second comeback attempt was short-lived and he then launched an eponymous range of sports clothing which became successful in Australia. Fenech also promoted professional boxing and trained a host of fighters including, briefly, Mike Tyson. In 2008 at the age of 43 he again returned to the ring and met his old nemesis Azumah Nelson, who was by now 49, and finally beat him albeit by majority decision. Fenech is an inductee of the International Boxing Hall of Fame and considered by many experts to be the finest native-born Australian boxer since Les Darcy eighty years previously.","Listed in Olympic Boxers Who Won a Professional World Championship (Olympics - 1984 Flyweight; Professional World Champion - WBC Featherweight (1988-1989); WBC Super-Bantamweight (1987-1987), IBF Bantamweight (1985-1986).)"

After moving to Montreal at a young age, he worked as a metal-caster for the Canadian Pacific Railway prior to joining the city’s police force in 1901. Within a year he had gained a name for himself by saving four children and their parents in a store from a potential arsonist. He also became affiliated with the Montreal Athletic Club and won the 56 lb. weight throwing event at the 1902 Amateur Athletic Union Championships against John Flanagan, who had won one Olympic gold medal in 1900, and would win two more at the 1904 and 1908 Summer Olympics at a sport that Desmarteau himself excelled at: the hammer throw. Desmarteu set his sights on the 1904 Summer Olympics in St. Louis, but his superiors at the police department refused to give him the time off and fired him after he decided to attend anyways. In the 56 lb. event Desmarteau clinched the gold medal with his first shot, as his nearest opponent, Flanagan, only managed to get within a foot of this attempt. This feat made him one of only two non-Americans, the other being Tom Kiely, to win a gold medal in athletics at these Olympics; the United States captured the other 23. He was celebrated upon his return, and rehired by the police force, and set a new record in the 56 lb. weight throw in July 1905, several months prior to his death from typhoid fever in October. He was made a member of Canada’s Sports Hall of Fame in 1955 and the Étienne Desmarteau Centre, used as a venue for the 1976 Olympic basketball tournament, was named in his honour.",

Janet Lynn had no peer as a free skater, and some people still consider her the most dominant free skater ever. But in her competitive days, school figures were so heavily weighted that her weak performance in those always kept her from winning a world championship and an Olympic gold medal. She did manage five U.S. (1969-73) titles, but when her free skating routines drove crowds into frenzies, the figure skating authorities decided it was time to change the rules. They did, but too late for Janet who by then had turned professional. In 1973 Janet Lynn signed a huge contract with the Ice Follies but her career was a short one. She began to have poorly explained respiratory problems and would be unable to finish her routines, forcing her retirement.

Two months later, he won the Final Trials with a new world record (7,875) and in his third and final competition, Morris won the Olympic title, again with a new world record (7,900), after he had trailed teammate Bob Clark by two points after the first day. In October 1936 Morris signed a contract with NBC as a radio announcer and in 1938 he had a brief career in movies, playing in three films, including the title role in “Tarzan’s Revenge.” He had a similarly brief career as a pro footballer with the Detroit Lions in 1940 and after being seriously wounded while serving as a naval officer in the Pacific he found employment difficult to come by.

Conner attended the University of Oklahoma, where he was a multiple All-American, graduating in 1984, and received the 1981 Nissen Award as the nation’s top gymnast. In 1979 Conner won the parallel bars gold medal at the World Championships, adding a bronze medal on vault and with the team. He also made the ill-fated 1980 US Olympic team, although an injury made it unlikely he would have been at his best. Conner continued to compete through the 1984 Olympics but was never again at his best because of injuries, including a torn bicep that almost forced him to miss the 1984 Olympic Trials. He came through in Los Angeles with a gold medal on parallel bars, his best event, where he did a one-hand handstand which was named for him, the Conner Spin. He also placed sixth in all-around. In 1991, after the fall of Communism in Romania, Nadia Comăneci escaped that country and came to the United States where she and Conner re-connected.

12309,Tommaso Lequio di Assaba,Male,21 October 1893,,, Italy,ITA,"Tommaso Lequio di Assaba was an Italian army officer who competed in the equestrian discipline of show jumping in 1920 and in both show jumping and eventing at the 1924 and 1928 Games. Originally from a distinguished military family, he joined the cavalry and by 1920 was already the President of the Italian Equestrian Federation when he competed at the Antwerpen Olympic Games. Riding a mount, Trebecco, that he had saved from being used as a draft horse, Tommaso was a surprise winner of the show jumping individual gold. The combination returned to slight decreasing rewards over the next two Games finishing second and fourth as part of the Italian team in Paris and Amsterdam. He was also a non-scoring member of the third-place team in eventing but it’s unlikely that he physically received a medal for this. Lequio di Assaba remained on the sports scene until 1935 when his farewell took place in Warszawa, Poland, at the local Nations Cup event where, together with his teammates Fernando Filipponi and Renzo Bonivento (both Olympians), the Italians produced three clear-rounds, Italy won in front of the very strong German team that was seriously preparing for the Olympic Games of the following year. For Tommaso, this was the last of 33 appearances in the various Nations Cups with 16 wins and six second places. By then a major, Lequio di Assaba commanded a regiment of native Eritreans during the Second Italo-Ethiopian War (1935-37). He became commander of the Tor di Quinto military school in 1942 then left to command an armoured division of the Italian army in North Africa during the final few months before Italy’s surrender and switching sides to fight alongside the Allies. He was captured by the British in Tunisia in the spring of 1943. Already highly decorated for bravery in two World Wars, he was awarded the title of Knight of the Military Order of Italy in 1947.

Possibly, Cator was also the first man to jump further than 8 metres, although information regarding his 1929 jump of 8.04 metres is sparse. Per the German newspaper “Düsseldorfer Stadt-Anzeiger” the jump supposedly occurred at Port-au-Prince on 28 April 1929, but was considered wind-aided. Cator’s 7.937 is still Haiti’s national record, making it the longest standing national record in track and field (as of 2024). Cator, who also played for the Haitian national football team, has the Stade Sylvio Cator in Port-au-Prince named after him. He also had a very brief career as a professional boxer, with one bout on 5 March 1922, a draw against Moses Daly. Personal Bests: HJ – 1.85 (1924); LJ – 7.93 (1928).",

In the 1930s, Erfmann, inspired by his travels to the Mediterranean, painted mainly Neoclassical landscapes and mythical figures. He attended several art schools and academies in Amsterdam, but all of them just for less than a year: the arts and crafts school Quellinus (1917-1918), the Institute for Artistic and Crafts Training and the Institute for the Training of Drawing Teachers (1927), and finally the Rijksakademie van beeldende kunsten (State Academy of Fine Arts, 1927-1928).

In 1918 he was Swiss speed skating champion over 3,000 metres. He then served in 1923 as site manager at the new plant of FC Bern, on the sports field at Neufeld. Beyeler also became one of the most famous architects in Switzerland for sports facilities. His father Albin worked as an engineer in railway projects. Hanns graduated in 1919 from the Technical School of Burgdorf and then moved for two years to Stuttgart at the Technical High School. In 1924 he founded his own office in Bern together with Rudolf von Sinner (1890-60). After World War II Beyeler dissolved the partnership with von Sinner and exclusively built sports facilities. In addition to stadiums in Thun and Bellinzona and the university sports plant in Bern he constructed 11 outdoor pools in the triangle of Bern-Basel-Zürich. His best known work was the Kunsteisbahn und Wellenbad Dählhölzli. The plant in a Bernese district was planned and built in 1932-34 (renovated 1986-89). It was commissioned by a private consortium and was also developed in view of profitability. For the first time in Switzerland, it included a facility for artificial waves. In order to be able to operate the plant all year round, a combination of an ice rink in the winter and outdoor swimming pool in the summer was chosen. It is now a listed monument. Four projects were submitted by Beyeler as “noncompetitive”, including that of a “sports park and beach resort in Thun-Dürrenast” from 1930. The resort was built in 1932-33, but not after the design by Beyeler. In 1930 he was awarded the project contract for the stadium on the St. Jakobsfeld in Basel. Its strictly symmetrical design with a wide central axis and a striking transversal block of cloak rooms with a central sports hall was modified according to plans by Julius Maurizio. The extensive earthworks began in 1937. During World War II, the construction had to be interrupted and the previous plans were not pursued. The opening of a stadium at this location ultimately took place in 1954.",

He also represented the USA at the World Junior Championships in 1985, where he took the gold medal, and won a bronze the 1987 Pan American Games in Indianapolis. Selected to compete for the USA in Seoul he reached the final only to be stopped by Canada’s Lennox Lewis in the 2nd round of their contest. Bowe turned professional after the Games and by 1992 had ran up thirty-one straight wins to earn the status of #1 contender to the world heavyweight title. In November 1992 in Las Vegas, he outpointed the previously unbeaten Evander Holyfield to become the undisputed heavyweight champion. After two routine defences Bowe met Holyfield again and lost his title in a fight memorable for the landing of a parachutist on the ring apron. After a series of fights which saw Bowe win and defend the WBO version of the world title he met Holyfield for a third time and defeated his old rival on an eight round stoppage. Struggling to control his weight, he was 15kg heavier for the next fight against Andrzej Gołota and struggled against his Polish opponent. Golota was leading on points when he was disqualified for a series of low blows. After the fight a riot broke out in which spectators and policemen were injured. A rematch in which Golota was again disqualified proved to be Bowe’s last before retirement. His next move was to join the US Marines but he left after completing a week of basic training. In 2000 he was convicted on kidnapping his estranged wife and children and sentenced to just 30 days in jail after his defence claimed he had suffered brain damage from his boxing career. This sentence was later put aside and Bowe was re-sentenced to 18 months in jail. After his release in 2004, he was able to get his boxing licence returned and he won two more fights albeit unimpressively. Bowe was declared bankrupt in 2005.","Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the Summer Pan American Games (0–0–1 1987 Indianapolis BOX bronze: super-heavyweight +91 kg) Listed in Olympic Boxers Who Won a Professional World Championship (Olympics - 1988 Heavyweight (Silver); Professional World Champion - IBF, WBA & WBC Heavyweight (1992-1992); IBF & WBA Heavyweight (1992-1993); WBO Heavyweight (1995-1996).)

In 1919 Guillemot won the French Military Championship, followed by his first national championship title over 5,000 m in 1920, which qualified him for the Antwerpen Olympics, where the clear favorite in the distance races was Paavo Nurmi. In the 5,000 m final, Nurmi attempted to exhaust his main rivals, Swedes Eric Backman and Rudolf Falk, over the early part of the race. After three laps Nurmi took the lead and built more speed, with only Guillemot able to follow him. Guillemot refused to yield and, on the final curve, Guillemot passed Nurmi on the outside and, unaccustomed to sprinting, Nurmi only jogged home four seconds after Guillemot. The 10,000 m final was started three hours early at the request of King Albert I, and Guillemot learned of this only after finishing a very large lunch. Fighting stomach cramps and shoes that were two sizes too big, as his own shoes had been stolen, Guillemot had to settle for silver behind Nurmi. After the 1920 Olympics, Guillemot won the International Cross-country Championships in 1922 individually and led the French team to a first place in 1922 and 1926.

Boyarskikh started to ski at a young age in her native Sverdlovsk (now Yekaterinburg), but did not rise to prominence until she won her first two Soviet Championship titles in the 5 km and relay in 1964 and qualified for the Olympic Games. At the 1964 Winter Olympic, Boyarskikh first won the 10 km, surprisingly beating her more famous teammates Yevdokiya Mekshilo and Mariya Gusakova, in a very close race. Four days later Boyarskikh won the 5 km, again narrowly defeating her closest rival Mirja Lehtonen from Finland. In the relay race, Boyarskikh, by then twice Olympic champion, skied the fastest leg of the competition to secure the Soviet gold medal, thus becoming the first female cross-country skier to win all available events at an Olympic Games. Boyarskikh did not perform well in 1965, winning only the 10 km race at Holmenkollen, but won again two Soviet titles in 1966, this time at 5 and 10 km. At the 1966 World Championships Boyarskikh won gold in the 10 km and relay race, but was beaten by her teammate Alevtina Kolchina in the 5 km race. In 1966 Boyarskikh also won a second consecutive Holmenkollen title at 10 km. In 1967 she won her last two Soviet titles, again in the 5 km and relay. She also won the 5 km race at Holmenkollen in 1967. Boyarskikh was not selected to the 1968 Soviet Olympic team, so she retired from sports and began working as a cross-country coach with Lokomotiv Sverdlovsk, a post she hold until her death.

A three-time Olympian, he made his Olympic debut in Atlanta 1996, and won a 1500m silver medal in Sydney 2000. Dominating his era, El Guerrouj is a four-time 1500m World champion, defending his 1997 title three consecutive times, and also winning two World silvers (1500m in 1995, 5000m in 2003). He was the“King of the Mile”. El Guerrouj’s first Olympic Games were in Atlanta in 1996 where he was favoured to challenge world champion Noureddine Morceli of Algeria, and was primed for a world record attempt. When he was moving into position in the 1500m final, however, he fell with 400m to go finishing a disappointing 12th. With redemption in his sights one month later, he became the first runner to defeat Morceli over 1500m in four years. Soon after, El Guerrouj began his assault on 1500m world dominance and won his four consecutive world titles (1997, 1999, 2001, 2003). One of the greatest middle-distance runners of all-time, El Guerrouj also won three World Indoor titles, winning gold in the 1500m (1995, 1997) and 3000m (2001), a bronze medal in the 5000m at the 1992 World Junior Championships.

66123,Bill LaRochelle,Male,12 July 1926,,, Canada,CAN,"Bill LaRochelle developed his athletic abilities in high school across several sports, but did not see his star truly rise until he began competing as a student at the University of Western Ontario. His first passion was track and field, where his prowess earned him a spot on Canada’s delegation to the 1948 Summer Olympics. In the 400 metre hurdles he failed to advance in a heat won by eventual silver medalist Duncan White, while in the 4×400 metres relay his team did not escape the opening round. He would later compete at the 1950 British Empire Games, after almost being cut from the team due to funding issues, where he finished fifth in the 4×440 yards relay (with Bill Parnell, Don Pettie, and Jack Hutchins) and was eliminated in the heats of 440 yards and 440 yards hurdles. LaRochelle was twice Canadian champion in the 440 hurdles, winning in 1948-49. Funding was not the only obstacle in LaRochelle’s path to the British Empire Games. In 1949 he had begun attending the University of Ottawa and playing football with the Ottawa Rough Riders of the Canadian Football League, which led some to question his status as an amateur athlete. Nonetheless he attended the Games and, upon graduation, moved to Winnipeg to suit up with the CFL’s Blue Bombers. During his tenure with the team, LaRochelle developed an interest in medicine, which ultimately led him to pursue a doctorate of medicine from the University of Manitoba. He acquired this in 1959 and moved to the United States to set up a practice, first in North Dakota, and then in California, where he spent the remainder of his life.

She was best known as a sprint cyclist, and her Olympic record would likely have been greater but track cycling was not an Olympic event for women until 1988, when she won a bronze medal in the sprint. Paraskevin-Young won four World Championships on the track in the sprint, including three consecutive in 1982-84, and won eight medals in that event in all, with six straight from 1982-87. At the 1978 World Sprint Speed Skating Championships she won two bronze medals in both 500 metre events. Domestically she was a 10-time US champion in the cycling sprint. In 1995 Paraskevin-Young set a world record for the 200 metre finish of the sprint, recording 11.064 at the World Championships. Her other major titles include sprint golds at the 1987 Pan American Games and 1990 Goodwill Games. She also won a 1991 bronze medal in the prized invitational track event, the Grand Prix de Paris, and a silver medal in the sprint at the 1995 Pan American Games.

He has taken the 500 m World title five times (1996, 1998-2001) and won Olypmic gold and silver in the distance. In 1995, 1997 and 2001, he also won the overall World Cup for this distance. Shimizu’s 1000 m was generally weaker, although he has won Olympic bronze and two World Championship medals in the event. Due to his weaker long sprint, Shimizu has never been able to win the World Sprint title. With three silvers, three bronzes and three fourth places, he is the best sprinter never to win the title. After winning the Olympic gold in 1998, Shimizu became the first man to break the 35-second barrier, setting his third of four 500 m World Records. His last World Record (34.42 in 2001) won him the Oscar Mathisen Trophy in for the year’s best speed skating performance. As the first Japanese speed skater to win an Olympic gold medal, Shimizu is a skating hero in his own country. This has allowed him to become the country’s first professional speed skater, and to continue racing well past his prime. In 2010, Shimizu will attempt to qualify for his fifth Olympics.

Instead he worked as a part-time carpenter in Malmö, although he had a stint with hockey in 2006, when he was the general manager of the 2006 Swedish Olympic team that won the gold medal.

Longbottom considered professionalism early in his career when, in 1982 he spent a season with the ACBB. A string of top five placing in the French amateur classics led to an offer from the Wolber pro team. However, he turned down the chance of a professional career and returned home.

Carter was a shot putter who won a silver medal at the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics. However, his track & field career is best known for something he did in high school. At the 1979 Golden West Invitational, Carter won the title with a throw of 81-3½ (24.78 m) with the 12-lb (5.5 kg) shot. The throw was a high school record by almost 10 feet (3 m), and as of 2017, no US high schooler has come within 2-feet of that mark. In 2004, it was chosen by Track & Field News among the top 25 greatest moments of the last quarter-century in track & field. Carter attended Southern Methodist University, where he won the NCAA title in 1981-83, finishing second to John Brenner in 1984. He also won four indoor NCAA titles in the shot. Carter also played football at SMU, which led to his second career. After the 1984 Olympics, he joined the San Francisco 49ers, playing with them as a nose tackle from 1984-92 in the NFL. Carter played on Super Bowl Champions three times with the 49ers, was named to the Pro Bowl three times (1985, 1987, 1988), and was a three-time first-team All-Pro (1986-88).

At the 1960 Roma Olympics the 100 km team time trial began the 1960 Olympic cycling program. Although it started at 09.00, the day was hot, with temperatures reaching 34° C. (93° F.). Therefore the teams had to fight hard and the East German team consisting of Gustav-Adolf Schur, Egon Adler, Günter Lörke, and Hagen lost Lörke early in the race. Nevertheless the team won the silver medal behind Italy. The race was overshadowed by the death of Knud Enemark Jensen from Denmark, today widely seen as one of the first drug misuse deaths caused by doping substances. Hagen later became a taxi driver in Leipzig. In 1978 he was found dead in his taxi after driving directly into a bridge pier. It was rumored he had family problems and committed suicide.",

25933,Karim Saddam,Male,26 May 1960,,, Iraq,IRQ,"Iraqi football player Karim Saddam got his start in the Baghdad Division with Al-Sinaa and Al-Jaish prior to joining Al-Karkh, then known as Al-Rasheed. At the conclusion of the 1985-1986 season he was sent off to Al-Siaha, a quiet team in the country’s second-tier league, which nearly signaled the end of his stardom at the age of 26. He was saved from this fate by an invitation from Coach Falah Hassan of Al-Zawraa, soon to become one of the Iraqi Premier League’s top clubs, to join the team. Saddam won his first Iraq FA Cup in 1989 with Al-Zawraa and scored a league record of 22 goals over the course of the regular season. The team captured the cup twice more in succession, as well as the league championship in 1991. After coming up empty-handed the following year they regained the cup in 1993 and held it every year from then until 2000, except for 1997, but Saddam would not stick around for these victories, as he retired following the 1992-1993 season. Throughout this period, he was the country’s top scorer four times. Prior to his club career, however, Saddam had a four-year stint with the Iraqi national team, beginning with a draw against East Germany in Baghdad in April 1982. At the 1984 Summer Olympics he played in all three of Iraq’s matches at the tournament, finishing with two losses and one draw and failing to qualify for the quarterfinals. His most memorable international moment, however, came in the qualifiers for the 1986 World Cup, when he was sent to the field to replace an injured Hussain Saeed in a match against the United Arab Emirates. Saddam scored the game-winning goal, setting the final score at 3-2, but its significance would not be revealed until Iraq lost its match 2-1 against the UAE a week later. Although the aggregate scores were tied, Iraq had a greater number of away goals (3 vs. 2), and thus Saddam’s goal ended up clenching Iraq’s first and, as of 2010, only World Cup appearance. In 2010 he ran for a seat in the Iraqi Parliament, along with his politically-opposed former teammate Ahmed Radhi.",

In total she has competed at five ice hockey World Championships, winning gold in 2004 and 2007 and silver in 2005, 2008 and 2009, in addition to capturing gold medal at the 2006 and 2010 editions of the Winter Olympic Games. She completed a psychology degree at Dartmouth College and played for their Big Green hockey team, earning the Eastern College Athletic Conference’s Player of the Year, the New England Hockey Writer’s MVP Award, and captaining the team her senior year.

By 1934 he was already proficient enough as a track and field athlete to compete at that year’s British Empire Games, where he won a silver medal in the 120 yard hurdles event and finished fourth in the 440 yard hurdles. The following year he received a Bachelor of Science degree from Montreal’s McGill University and was still in good enough form to compete at the 1936 Summer Olympics, where he competed in the 110 and 400 metre hurdles, although he failed to make it past the first round in either event. Perhaps more importantly, however, he was selected as Canada’s flag bearer in the opening ceremony, likely due to his status as the tallest member of the delegation. Worrall retired from active competition soon after and received a law degree from Osgoode Hall Law School, but his impact on the Canadian sporting scene was far from over. He worked as a schoolmaster, lawyer, and public notary, but soon became involved with the Canadian Olympic Committee, ascending to its presidency in 1961 and holding that position through 1968. He helped write the constitution of that organization before taking his talents international in 1967 by becoming an IOC member, a role in which he would become deeply involved for over two decades. Until his 1989 retirement, he served on the Legislation Commission (1968-1972), the IOC Executive Board (1974-1979), and the Juridical Commission (1984-1985), as well as chairing the Commission on Revision of the Charter (1982-1990).

He studied in Johannesburg and Pretoria, and received his Master of Arts degree at 35-years-old. He also wrote many art books, articles, founded the magazine “De Arte”, and created the so-called Fook Island (island of the imagination), in which he composed the real life with all the figures and materials that existed in the real world as well. He created a map, imaginary people, plants, animals, a history as well as a set of postage stamps, currency, passports and driver’s licenses and even its own language. In 1953 Battiss became director of the Pretoria Art Centre, and in 1965 he was appointed to the chair of Fine Arts and Art History at the University of South Africa. In 1981, a museum was opened for him in his hometown of Somerset. A year later he visited the “documenta” in Kassel. Battiss got interested in African rock painting at an early age, which was reflected in his works. He combined it with influences of Fauvism and Surrealism, amongst others. He painted the Quagga Race, an oil painting measuring 61 x 76 cm, in 1948; it is now in a private collection. The quagga, a partially striped zebra species that became extinct by the end of the 19th century, is a recurring motif in Battiss’ work.

Lead by the popular Věra Čáslavská, Czechoslovakia came close to beating the Soviet Union, but ended up 0.65 points short. A quarter of a century later, Karasyova made headlines when she apparently revealed that the USSR had used dubious methods to win the gold medal. Their coaches and doctors had discovered that during pregnancy, more red blood cells are being produced, which leads to an increas in lung capacity and muscle power. In addition, the progesteron hormone is produced, which makes the muscles and joints more supple. As Karasyova was believed to have told German television in 1994, she and her team mates were forced to become pregnant shortly before the Olympics. Girls that did not have a boyfriend or husband were forced to have sex with their coach. Refusal led to being thrown off the team. After ten weeks, the girls had an abortion. While rumours of such practices with Soviet, Scandinavian and East-German girls had been around since the 1950s, no proof was ever given until Karasyova’s disclosure and the story fell apart when it was revealed that the person who was interviewed was not Karasyova but an imposter using her name.",Wife of Valery Karasyov

920197,John Weinzweig,Male,11 March 1913,,, Canada,CAN,"John Weinzweig, son of Polish Jewish immigrants, was one of Canada’s greatest classical music composers. He took up music as a high school student and studied multiple instruments, eventually attending the Toronto Conservatory of Music and earning a bachelor’s degree in music in 1937. Subsequently, he completed his studies in Rochester, New York. In 1939, Weinzweig started teaching at the Conservatory. He also began composing in the late 1930s, mainly for radio, but his career was interrupted by World War II, in which he served with the Royal Canadian Air Force from 1943 through 1945. Upon his return he gave up radio and turned to composing concert music. He submitted a piece, Divertimento No 1 for Solo Flute and Strings, to the instrumental and chamber music category of the art competitions at the 1948 Summer Olympics and won silver, the highest honor in the competition, as no gold medal was awarded. Weinzweig was one of only two Canadian medalists ever in the art competitions, the other being Tait McKenzie, who won bronze in the medals and reliefs category at the 1932 Games. Weinzweig’s Divertimento was completed in 1946 and premiered in Vancouver in December of the same year. It consists of three movements (I. Fast and playful; II. Slow; III. Moderately fast, fast) and is approximately 11-minutes long. His second entry, Of Time and the World, known as beginning in 1947 Of Time, Rain and the World, was his ﬁrst work for solo voice. It comprises three short songs for medium voice and piano based on single words and short phrases from Rogetʼs Thesaurus, arranged by the composer.

The event was unknown in America, but Sloane consulted the works of Lucian. Garrett, from a wealthy Baltimore banking family hired a local blacksmith to construct an implement in accordance with the description of Lucian. The result of this weighed some 20 lbs. (9 kg.) and Garrett quickly relinquished his interest in discus throwing. At Athens, however, Garrett spotted the competition disc, took several throws with this vastly more manageable instrument, and decided to enter after all. He took the first Olympic discus title by upsetting local favorite Panagiotis Paraskevopoulos. The following day the long jump and shot put were held within half-an-hour of each other and Garrett finished as runner-up in the long jump, but claimed a second Olympic title in the shot put. Bob Garrett won two more medals at the 1900 Olympics and in the intervening years he won the shot and finished second at the 1897 IC4A for Princeton; the following year, representing Johns Hopkins, he finished second in the shot. With his six Olympic medals, Garrett is the most successful of all Princeton Olympians and in recognition of his accomplishments, the Garrett Memorial Track at Princeton is named after him. The discus which Garrett threw at Athens in 1896 is also on display at the Dillon Gymnasium. Garrett’s career was as an investment banker and he became very wealthy. He also served on the boards of several companies. He collected ancient manuscripts from Egypt and the Middle East, and in 1942 he presented his collection to Princeton. He was active in the development of public recreational facilities in Baltimore, was active in the National Recreation Association and became its chairman in 1941.

He then started for re-unified Germany in 1992-96 in the welterweight class. At Barcelona he was eliminated in the group stage and at Atlanta he placed fifth. In 2000 at Sydney Leipold moved to middleweight and seemingly won the gold medal. That lasted about three weeks until Leipold’s doping test turned positive for nandrolone, an anabolic steroid. He was disqualified and USA wrestler Brandon Slay moved up to the gold medal. Leipold then tried in vain to sue the IOC for irregularities in the doping test. Nevertheless, since the lawsuit he has been allowed to call himself “Winner of the Olympic Games in Sydney 2000”, although without being included in the statistics. He was rehabilitated by the independent Steiner Commission in 2010. Leipold won several international medals including the 1994 gold medal at the Worlds, adding three silvers in 1995, 1997 and 1999.

In 1911 Alfred went to London and studied violin at the Royal Academy of Music but, at the same time, was starting to develop as an athlete and was to become a fine all-round competitor. Although of modest stature, he developed a fine physique through bodybuilding under the guidance of the great German trainer Eugen Sandow. He featured in the AAA hammer throw for 10 years (1905-14) and was the winner in 1910. He won the AAA pole vault in 1909, when he was the only competitor, and he placed in the first six in both the shot and discus at the Championships. He was also an above-average boxer and gymnast and, unusually for a specialist in the weight events, he was a talented violinist and artist. His career is particularly well-documented in the writings of F. A. M. Webster who credits Flaxman with a Bohemian hammer record in excess of 150-0 (45.72) shortly before World War I, but no confirmation of this record can be traced. Webster, who served in the South Staffordshire Regiment with Flaxman, wrote that when they were stationed together at Etaples, “the men simply adored Flaxman.” Clearly, not all the officers were held in such high regard as it was in the Bull Ring at Etaples that the “Monocoled Mutineer,” Percy Toplis, began his notorious revolt.

In addition to winning an Allan Cup, given annually to the men’s amateur senior ice hockey champions in Canada, in 1921, he also helped capture the intercollegiate championships all three times. The following year he was made an honorary coach of the school’s senior and intermediate teams, both of whom won their intercollegiate champions.

In addition to playing in five games and scoring ten goals, helping his team win gold in that year’s ice hockey tournament, he also served as a referee for the matches between France and Great Britain, and France and the United States.

He also suited up for thirteen games with the International Hockey League’s Salt Lake Golden Eagles that year. In 1992 he signed with the NHL’s Calgary Flames and began his four-season stint with the team, which was followed by a transfer to the Phoenix Coyotes that saw him skating all but two games with the associated Las Vegas Thunder of the IHL. He returned to the Flames in 1997, but spent the majority of that year in the IHL as well, this time with the Chicago Wolves. For 1998-1999 he bounced between the NHL’s St. Louis Blues and Toronto Maple Leafs, suiting up for three matches with the latter, but again spent most of his time with the Wolves.

After graduating from Waseda High School, he enrolled at Waseda University and played for the university soccer team in the fullback position. He participated in the 1934 Far East Championships, playing against the Philippines and China. In 1936, he was part of the Japanese national football team for that year’s Summer Olympics. In the first match against Sweden, Horie was hit by accident and broke his right arm 15 minutes into the first half. He continued to play because no substitution was allowed according to the rules at the time. Taking advantage of Horie’s injury, Sweden scored twice in the first half. In the second half, Japan achieved a come-from-behind victory scoring three goals, an upset called the “miracle of Berlin” in Japanese football. With his broken arm, he was not able to play their second match against Italy and Japan was defeated 8-0. After returning to Japan, Horie joined the Asahi Shimbun newspaper as a reporter. In 1949, he published the book Technics and Theory of Football together with Takeshi Kamo. In 1951, while Horie was a professor of political science and economics at the Waseda University, he became chairman and coach of the University’s soccer section. He encouraged several excellent players, who under his leadership won the 1966 Emperor’s Cup for the university. As a leader, he laid the foundation for the prospering of soccer in Japan. From 1987-93 he served as president of the Ohtsuki City College. As an economist, Horie wrote a number of papers on Marxist economy. He died of pneumonia at the age of 89.",
9733,Geoff Colyer,Male,18 May 1931,,, Great Britain,GBR,"Geoff Colyer only took up canoeing in 1951 and, before the year was out, he was the K-1 10,000 metres national champion, runner-up in the 1,000 metres to Roland Prout, and second with Graham Palmer in the K-2 10,000 metres. A member of the Royal Canoe Club, he went to the 1952 Helsinki Olympics and competed in the K-1 1,000 and 10,000 events. He was seventh and last in his heat in the shorter distance, and classified 12th out of 17 starters in the 10K event. Just a month after the Games, however, Colyer won the K-1 500 and K-1 10,000 at the National Championships and was second to Ray Parker in the K-1 1,000. In 1953 Colyer and Palmer won the kayak doubles at the Willesden Coronation Regatta. It was the first regatta on the famous Welsh Harp water, in the shadow of Wembley Stadium, for around 80 years. Colyer also won the K-1 event. Also that year, he beat a very strong Swedish contingent to win the K-1 10,000 metres Paddling Challenge Cup during the Kingston Regatta. In 1954 Colyer was serving in the Royal Air Force (RAF) and won the K-1 1,000 metres national title. Colyer put himself in the frame for a second Olympic selection when he won both the K-1 and K-2 (with Ray Parker) at the season’s opening regatta on the Welsh Harp Sailing Club. Colyer did eventually get the call-up for the Melbourne Games but only as a reserve. The selectors were prepared to nominate Brian Bullivant, Ray Blick, Colyer and Patricia Moody for the GB team but, as the BOA could only sponsor two men and one woman, it was Colyer who was left out. Colyer later emigrated to Australia and in 2005 flew from his home in Australia to London for a gathering of around 600 British Olympians to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the BOA.",

By 1990 Schmirler wanted to skip (captain) her own team and offered McCusker a position as second, but McCusker refused, as she had already committed to another rink with her sister and Marcia Gudereit.

Their hard work quickly paid off, and they won the Canadian National and World Championships in 1993, 1994, and 1997 and distinguishing themselves as the first Canadian women’s team to win more than one national championship with the same lineup. Their journey then took them to the 1998 Winter Olympics, where they easily won the gold medal in a sport that had not been recognized as an official part of the program since 1924, but it came to an abrupt end in 2000 when Schmirler died of cancer.

He debuted internationally at the Munich Olympics, bowing out in the qualification, but did better at the 1974 Asian Games, where he won a bronze in the decathlon. A year later, he became Asian champion in that same discipline. In the long jump, he won gold at the 1978 Asian Games, and bronze in the Commonwealth Games that same year.

86083,Marc Girardelli,Male,18 July 1963,178.0,82, Luxembourg,LUX,"Marc Girardelli is among the best alpine skier ever not to become Olympic champion. He is a record five-time winner of the overall World Cup (1985, 1986, 1989, 1991, 1993) and a fourfold World Champion (slalom 1991, combined 1987, 1989, 1996). A native Austrian, he started skiing for the Luxembourg federation after a dispute with the Austrian skiing federation. As he only obtained his citizenship in 1987, Girardelli could not start at the 1984 Olympics. His medal-less 1988 début did not go as expected, and even his two silver medals in Albertville were somewhat of a disappointment, having eyed at least one gold medal. His medals were Luxembourg’s first Olympic medals in 40 years. They were also the country’s first at the Winter Olympics. Outside of the Olympics, Girardelli is one of the all time greats by all measures. He is the only skier to have won at least 3 World Cup races in each of the five disciplines (totalling 42), and he reached the podium 100 times. In addition to his five overall World Cups, Girardelli also won crystal globes for each of the five events - the first man to achieve this. Among men, only Kjetil André Aamodt has won more World Championship medals than Girardelli’s 11, won in four distinct events (all except the downhill). Having previously suffered a severe back injury in December 1989, Girardelli retired following a knee injury after his last World title in 1996. He then became an entrepeneur, being involved in a hotel, an indoor ski slope, a clothing line, and working as an advisor to skiing federations.","Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the World Alpine Ski Championships (4–4–3 1985 Bormio silver: slalom, bronze: giant slalom; 1987 Crans-Montana gold: combined, silver: Super G and giant slalom; 1989 Vail gold: combined, bronze: slalom; 1991 Saalbach-Hinterglemm gold: slalom; 1993 Morioka silver: slalom, bronze: combined; 1996 Sierra Nevada gold: combined)"

He first made the Austrian national team in 1958 and competed at three Winter Olympics – in 1960, 1964, and 1968, winning a silver medal in giant slalom in 1964 at Innsbruck. After Jean-Claude Killy won all three Alpine events at the 1968 Grenoble Olympics, he retired from amateur competition, and Schranz took over the mantle of the world’s top ski racer. Expected to win several events at the 1972 Winter Olympics, he never even got to compete. Prior to the Sapporo Olympics, Avery Brundage, who hated the professionalism of skiiers in the Winter Olympics, singled out Schranz and banned him from the Games for professional contracts, which Schranz admitted to. However, almost all the top “amateur” skiiers had contracts with various ski companies at that time. Schranz was a four-time champion in the classic Lauberhorn downhill at Wengen, and also won the Hahnenkamm downhill in Kitzbühel four times. From 1957-70 he won nine Arlberg-Kandahar races. His record at the World Championships was far better than his Olympic one. He won the downhill and combined at Chamonix in 1962, adding a silver medal in giant slalom. After a 1966 giant slalom bronze medal in Portillo, Chile, Schranz won another World gold in 1970 at Gröden, this one in the giant slalom. In World Cup races, Schranz was overall season champion in 1969 and 1970, winning the downhill event title both years, and won the giant slalom seasonal World Cup in 1969. He won 12 World Cup races, with eight downhill victories, and stood on 23 World Cup podiums. Schranz also won 11 Austrian national titles. He is considered among the greatest ever downhill racers, surpassed in the Austrian pantheon of ski racing heroes only by Franz Klammer. After his forced retirement after the 1972 Winter Olympics, Schranz settled in Sankt Anton where he owned a hotel. He was also instrumental in helping organize the 2001 World Championships. Schranz received numerous honors during and after his career, being named Austrian Sportsman of the Year in 1959, 1962, and 1970, and being awarded the Skiier d’Or in 1966, 1969, and 1970. In 1980 he received a gold medal for services to the Austrian Republic, and in 1998 was given the grand decoration of the Republic of Austria.","Bearer of the Olympic Flag at the opening ceremony of the 2012 Winter Youth Olympics Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the World Alpine Ski Championships (3–2–1 1962 Chamonix gold: downhill and combined, silver: giant slalom; 1964 Innsbruck (Olympics) silver: giant slalom; 1966 Portillo bronze: giant slalom; 1970 Val Gardena gold: giant slalom)"

Miller became involved in a drug distribution ring, using a secret compartment in a Toyota Camry that he used to transport methamphetamine, melted and hidden in eight white candles. A search of his home in February 2021 revealed heroin in a bag in his wardrobe, several mobile phones, and more than $72,000 in proceeds from crime stashed in a bag, hidden inside a locked safe. He told police that he ran an escort agency. Miller went to trial in 2022 in the New South Wales District Court along with two of his associates, Wayne Johnson and Justin Szabolics. Police had been alerted to Miller’s actions with hidden cameras in the Bahamas that showed Miller and Johnson handing the drugs over to Szabolics and another man, and then speeding away from a roadside police stop and dumping a bag of drugs behind a tree off the Hume Highway. Miller pled guilty and was sentenced to five years in jail for playing a “central role” in a drug supply operation.

79070,Andrew Sockalexis,Male,11 January 1891,175.0,66, United States,USA,"Raised in Maine, Andrew Sockalexis was a member of the Penobscot Indian Tribe, a grandson of the Chief of the influential Bear Clan. Little is known of his early life, but he settled near Boston by 1911 and joined the North Dorchester Athletic Association, where he excelled as a long-distance runner, despite his relatively large size (for the era) of 5-9 and 145 lbs. Like many Indian athletes of the era, he attended the Carlisle Indian School, where he ran on the track team. Sockalexis made his first appearance as a marathon runner in 1911, when he ran the Boston Marathon, finishing 17th. In 1912, Sockalexis had improved and hoped to win Boston. But running in ice and mud, he lagged behind the early pace, only to take the lead a few miles from the finish. However, he was caught by Mike Ryan, who bettered Sockalexis’s time of 2-21:52 by about 34 seconds, but the second-place finish was sufficient to qualify him for the 1912 U.S. Olympic team. At Stockholm, Sockalexis again started out slowly. His fast finish earned him 4th place, as he finished in 2-42:07.9, just missing out on a medal, slightly over five minutes behind the winner, Kennedy McArthur of South Africa. Returning to the United States, Sockalexis made headlines prior to the 1913 Boston Marathon. The Boston Evening Transcript described his dilemma in the headline “Win, or Lose Her Hand”. His fiancé, Pauline Shay, also a Penobscot, had told him that he had to win Boston before she would marry him. Unfortunately, Sockalexis continued his race plan of starting out slowly and finishing strong, and once again, it was not quite enough. He placed second for the second consecutive year, this time in 2-27:12, two minutes behind the Swedish winner Fritz Carlson. Despite the loss, Ms. Shay still married him. He never ran the Boston Marathon again, and no further record of his athletic career exists. Sockalexis is still remembered in his native land. The Penobscot Tribe sponsors an annual Andrew Sockalexis 5 Kilometre Road Run in his honor. In April 2000, Andrew Sockalexis was inducted into the American Indian Athletic Hall of Fame along with his cousin, Louis. He and Louis were also inducted as charter members of the Maine Baseball Hall of Fame in 1969. His brother has actually achieved more lasting sporting fame. An excellent baseball player, Louis Francis Sockalexis played for three years in the major leagues (1897-1899) with the team then named the Cleveland Spiders. Legend has it that 20 years later the team was renamed in Louis Sockalexis’s honor as the Cleveland Indians, but this is now considered controversial. Personal Best: Mar – 2-21:53 (1912).",

Starting in pairs skating, they placed second at the 1982 Canadian Junior Nationals, but after Isabelle suffered a serious accident and hit her head on the ice, they switched to ice dancing. After a third-place finish at the Canadian Nationals in 1985, and angry at the policies of the Canadian Figure Skating Association, they began to compete for France from 1986. They were four-time French champions, winning the title in 1986-87 and 1990-91, but their biggest victory came in winning the 1991 World Championships, which followed a silver in that event in 1990 and a bronze in 1989. The Duchesnay’s also won Skate America in the 1986-87 season. They were three-time medalists at the European Championships, winning bronze in 1988 and 1990 and a silver in 1991. The Duchesnays choreographer was Christopher Dean, the 1984 Olympic ice dancing gold medalist, and he and Isabelle would marry, but would later divorce. Their best known free dance performance was set to jungle drums and was initially quite controversial to the staid international skating judges.

A 1978 Commonwealth Games champion, Olsen personally received his gold medal from Queen Elizabeth II who told him, “Good job, Master Olsen. You represented your country so well.” He was world ranked number three and favoured to win a medal at the 1980 Olympic Games in Moscow, but Olsen missed his opportunity when Canada joined the US-led boycott following the Soviet Union’s invasion of Afghanistan. At the Pan American Games, Olsen finished fifth (1975), fourth (1979), and seventh (1983). Due to a shoulder injury, he missed the podium placing fourth at the 1982 Commonwealth Games in Brisbane, and then missed making the 1984 Los Angeles Olympic team due to another injury. Long known for his positive outlook on life, Olsen’s javelin career started in 1970 while attending high school at Woodlands Secondary School in Nanaimo, British Columbia. By 1973, he was the Canada Summer Games champion, where he set a world junior record and was named the most outstanding athlete of the Games, and won the prestigious Viscount Alexander Award as Canada’s most outstanding junior athlete in 1973. Olsen went on to set numerous school and provincial records, and in 1975 he set his British Columbia high school mark which still stood at the time of his death. An 11-time Canadian champion, Olsen attended the University of Tennessee becoming an NCAA champion and four-time All-American, and once threw a football 100 yards at a college football half-time show in front of 75,000 fans. Retiring in his prime at the age of 28 in 1985, for more than 30 years Olsen pursued a career in teaching, where he was dedicated to being a role model for his students and making a huge impact on their lives. He spent the rest of his life staying involved in physical fitness and living a healthy lifestyle. In 1994, Olsen was named Canada’s greatest javelin thrower in history by a panel of Canadian sports writers. Along with two-time Olympian basketball player Gerald Kazanowski and Olympic double gold medallist rower Brenda Taylor, Olsen was one of the first three charter athletics inducted into the Nanaimo Sports Hall of Fame when it opened in 2008.Olsen was born, raised and died (of a massive coronary heart attack at age 63 while out collecting firewood) in his hometown of Nanaimo, British Columbia.

85790,Peter Forsberg,Male,20 July 1973,185.0,93, Sweden,SWE,"Center-forward Peter Forsberg had a highly successful career both internationally and at the club level. Known for his on-ice vision and physical play, Forsberg is considered as one of the most complete players of his generation. During his 13-season stay in the NHL, he stands, as of 2013, eighth all-time in career points-per-game and fifth all-time in career assists-per-game, behind only Wayne Gretzky, Mario Lemieux, Bobby Orr and Sidney Crosby. During his career in NHL, Forsberg never had a negative plus-minus rating, giving him an overall career rating of +238. Forsberg is also a member of the Triple Gold Club, players who have won a Stanley Cup, a World Championship and an Olympic gold medal and he is the only Swede on the list, as of 2013, who has won each of the three competitions twice. The son of Kent Forsberg, who was the former coach of MoDo Hockey and the Swedish national team, Forsberg began his career in 1989 with MoDo Hockey, playing with them until 1995. He never won the Swedish title with them, his best finish being a runner-up in 1994, but in 1993 and 1994 he was awarded the Guldpucken award as the best player at the Swedish Championships and the Guldhjälmen award as MVP of the Swedish Championships, voted by the players. He is the only person to be awarded both Guldpucken and Guldhjälmen awards twice. Forsberg was drafted by the Philadelphia Flyers of the NHL in 1991, but on June 1992 his rights were traded to the Québec Nordiques along with five players, two first-round draft picks and 15 million dollars in exchange for Eric Lindros. The Lindros trade is regarded as one of the most lopsided deals in hockey history, and the deal became a major foundation for the Nordiques/Avalanche franchise’s success over the next decade. Forsberg débuted in the NHL in 1995 during the lockout shortened 1994-95 season. He had a very good rookie season, scoring 50 points (15 goals and 35 assists) in 47 games, won the Calder Memorial Trophy as the rookie-of-the-year and was named to the NHL All-Rookie team. The next season the Nordiques moved and became the Colorado Avalanche and Forsberg was their main force with 86 points (28 goals, 58 assists) during the regular season and 21 points (10 goals, 11 assist) during the playoffs as Colorado/Québec won its first Stanley Cup. The Avalanche won their second Stanley Cup in 2001 and Forsberg had his best NHL season in 2002-03, when he led the league with 106 points (29 goals, 77 assists), for which he was awarded the Art Ross Trophy, the Hart Memorial Trophy as league MVP, and the Bud Light Plus/Minus Award. During his stay with the Avalanche, Forsberg was also awarded the Viking award as the best Swede in the NHL in 1996, 1998 and 1999, was selected to the NHL All-Star Game in 1996-01 and 2003, and was named to the NHL All-Star First Team in 1998 and 1999. During the 2004-05 NHL lockout, Forsberg played for MoDo Hockey. He then opted to sign a two-year contract with the Flyers instead of a four-year contract with the Avalanche. In 2006, Forsberg became captain of the Flyers, but was traded to the Nashville Predators at the end of the 2005-06 season. In 2007, Forsberg returned to the Avalanche as a free agent, but played only nine games with them due to a foot injury. From 2008-10 Forsberg played for MoDo Hockey again, before signing a one year contract with the Avalanche in 2010, but he played only two games with them during the 2010-11 season, retiring from hockey in February 2011, citing the foot injury. Internationally Forsberg played at four Olympic Games (1994, 1998, 2006 and 2010), five World Championships (1992-93, 1998, 2003-04) and at 1996 and 2004 World Cup. He won Olympic golds in 1994 and 2006, World titles in 1992 and 1998 and World Championships silvers in 1993, 2003 and 2004. Forsberg was the top scorer with 11 points and the leading goal scorer at the 1998 World Championships. He was also named as the best forward at the 1998 World Championships. Forsberg was awarded the Stora Grabbars Märke (Big Boys’ Badge) #165 in ice hockey and was elected to the IIHF Hall of Fame in 2013. After finishing his sporting career, Forsberg worked as general manager of MoDo Hockey. He also owns the Swedish development company named Forspro Company, that co-funded the building of Swedbank Arena, the home arena of MoDo Hockey and Pforce AB, a company that imports and markets Crocs shoes in Sweden. Forsberg is also interested in harness racing, and owns a few racing horses and has invested in the Veckefjärdens Golf Club in his native Örnsköldsvik. With Markus Näslund, he is also the co-founder of Icebreakers, an organization that brings together professional ice hockey players for exhibition games to raise money for charities.","Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the World Ice Hockey Championships (2–3–0 1992 Praha and Bratislava gold; 1993 Dortmund and München silver; 1998 Zürich and Basel gold; 2003 Helsinki, Tampere, and Turku silver; 2004 Praha and Ostrava silver) Listed in Olympic Champions Who Have Played in a Stanley Cup Winning Team (Olympic Gold – 1994; Stanley Cup Champion – 1996/2001 Colorado Avalanche.)

Gross was a sculptor and graphic artist, and added lithography to his studio practice, creating luminous and profound renderings of historic and modern Judaic subjects. In 1927 he became a professor for sculpture and printing techniques and continued teaching up to an old age. For some time, Gross was president of the Sculptors Guild of America. After World War II, he traveled to Israel several times and designed a memorial for the murdered Jews of Europe for New York. In addition to bronze figures, he especially created numerous wooden figures. From the 1950s, he became more concerned with painting and graphics. His daughter Mimi Gross (né 1940) later became a well-known performance artist with huge 3-D constructions. Gross repeatedly dealt with the topic of Acrobats, most of which he produced in later decades. In view of the year of origin (1932), the wooden sculpture Acrobatic Dancers, also called Acrobatic Performers is a likely candidate to be his entry.

He then studied at the Leek School of Art before going to the Royal College of Art from 1905-08. From 1913-16 he worked as an interior designer and produced mainly stained glass, tapestry designs and murals for churches. He became well-known for introducing Japanese print techniques to the European market for his posters. Considered a post-impressionist, Platt then produced posters for the London Underground and taught at art schools, first in Derby, then in Edinburgh and finally for the Blackheath School of Art in London. As an official artist to the Ministry of War Transport during World War II, he painted scenes of river traffic, maritime rescue services, ocean transport, docks and marshalling yards. The two works submitted in 1928 and 1948, The Scrum and Rugby, were obviously the same work, only under different names. The two works titled Giant Stride are also identical. In 1948, therefore, both ran “out of competition”.
