Nesty was not considered a butterfly favorite in Seoul, that being Matt Biondi, after the world’s best butterflyer in the mid-1980s, Pablo Morales, shockingly failed to make the US team at the Olympic Trials. In the 100 butterfly final at Seoul, Biondi led the race until the last stroke, but he was between strokes at the wall and elected to kick in, only to be slightly farther out than he realized, which allowed Nesty to pass him and win gold by 1/100th of a second. Nesty also qualified for the 200 fly final, finishing eighth, and in 1992, won another Olympic medal, bronze in the 100 fly. Born in Trinidad, Nesty’s family migrated to Suriname when he was 7-months-old, and he started swimming at the age of 5. After representing Suriname at the 1983 Pan-American Games and 1984 Olympics, he enrolled in the Bolles School in Jacksonville, Florida, a prep school with an athletic program known for training elite, world-class swimmers. After finishing fifth in the 100 butterfly at the 1986 World Championships, Nesty won his first international medals at the 1987 Pan-American Games, with gold in the 100 fly and bronze in the 200 fly, and then repeated his 100 butterfly victory at the 1991 Pan American Games, adding a 200 fly silver at those games. He won 100 butterfly gold medals at the 1991 World Championships, 1990 Goodwill Games, and 1989 Pan Pacific Championships. As a University of Florida student, Nesty won NCAA 100 yd butterfly titles in 1990-92, a 200 yd butterfly title in 1990, and a medley relay title in 1991. Nesty graduated from the University of Florida in 1994 and then worked as a swimming coach. From 1994-98 Nesty was swimming coach at the Bolles School and was also coach of Swim Florida in Sarasota.

Samuelshaug was a big local hero when he placed ninth in the 1933 Holmenkollen 18 km cross-country race, and the local interest exploded when in 1935 he placed third both in the 18 km and 50 km. His Olympic appearance in 1936 was a disappointment for him and his local followers, as he gave up the race at the halfway point with extremely bad skis. But in 1937 he came back strongly and won the Holmenkollen 50 km after a close battle with the Swedish skier Nils Englund, bronze medalist from the 50 km race in the 1936 Olympics. The excitement in his home community was enormous. It is said that an old man, bedridden by illness, became so excited that he left his bed for the first time in 10 years! Writer and humorist from Alvdal, Kjell Aukrust, wrote a play 25 years later about Samuelshaug’s Holmenkollen victory called “Dobbelsats og freske fraspark” (Double takeoff and fresh push-offs), and the play became a big success. Samuelshaug became a farmer and died in Alvdal in 1990, aged 85.",

His budding career was interrupted by World War II, when he enlisted in the United States Army, but he soon resumed his passion by creating artwork for the military magazines Stars and Stripes and Yank. Following the conflict he attended the Nuremberg Trials in 1945 as a courtroom artist, his drawings eventually ending up in the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum. His next stop was Paris where he worked as a freelancer out of his own illustration studio. By this time he had become well known as both an illustrator and an épée fencer and, upon his return to the United States, he was granted the opportunity to pursue both interests. For the latter his most notable accomplishment was an appearance at the 1952 Summer Olympics, where he made it to the semi-finals of the individual event and the quarter-finals of the team tournament. Although he intended to attend the 1956 and 1960 editions, a detached retina and a newborn child respectively scuttled his chances. At the 1951 Pan American Games he won gold with the foil team (with Albert Wolff, Tibor Nyilas, Byron Krieger, Nate Lubell, and Joe de Capriles), silver with the épée team (with Albert Wolff, Frederick Weber, Byron Krieger, Nate Lubell, and Joe de Capriles), and bronze in the individual épée. In addition to his freelance work for numerous American publications, Vebell has also designed sixteen stamps for the United States Postal Service and remained active in the art community of Westport, Connecticut until his death.","Brother-in-law of Maria Cerra Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the Summer Pan American Games (1–1–1 1951 Buenos Aires FEN gold: foil team, silver: épée team, bronze: épée)"

Their sister Betsy was also a top gymnast at the University of Florida, winning the 1998 NCAA title on balance beam. Paul Hamm’s all-around gold medal at the 2004 Olympics did not come without controversy. He was in third place after five rotations but ended his event on the high bar, and his score of 9.837 put him in the lead over Yang Tae-Yeong and Kim Dae-Eun of Korea. Then the protests began. The Koreans protested Yang’s score on his last rotation, also the high bar, saying that he was given a start value of 9.9 instead of the 10.0 they thought he deserved. Protests and appeals went back and forth between the Korean and American gymnastics officials, but eventually Paul Hamm stayed in first place and kept the gold medal, although the President of the Fédération Internationale de Gymnastique (FIG), Bruno Grandi, wrote him a letter saying he should relinquish the gold medal and give it to Yang. That letter was denounced by IOC President Jacques Rogge. The Korean appeal then went to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) and on 21 October 2004 they ruled that the Olympic results, as announced, would stand and Hamm retained his gold medal. Hamm won the 2004 Sullivan Award as the nation’s top amateur athlete, only the second gymnast to win that after Kurt Thomas. He studied at The Ohio State University but returned to competition in 2007. However, injuries prevented him from being able to compete at the 2008 Olympics. He later made another comeback, trying to make the 2012 Olympic team, but aborted that attempt early and retired from gymnastics.

Larghetto (8:03); 3. Presto, Tempo di marcia – Allegro risoluto – Presto (5:06). Soon after, his symphony was stigmatized as “formalistic” and not in line with the Socialist “realism” demanded by the official cultural policy. Polish stamps, issued on the occasion of the 1960 Olympic Games in Roma, celebrated previous Polish gold medal winners: The 2.50 Zł. stamp celebrated Zbigniew Turski’s gold medal in the art competitions.

They lost their first-round match 3-0 to the eventual gold medallists Sweden. In total, in an 11-year international career he won 51 caps and scored five goals. As a player, his greatest moment came in 1954 when Austria finished third at the FIFA World Cup behind Germany and Hungary, after beating Uruguay in the third-place match 3-1. He also participated in the 1958 World Cup in Sweden where Austria was eliminated from their heavy group, won by Brazil, that also contained the Soviet Union and England. At club level, Happel played with SK Rapid Wien (Vienna) between 1942-59 and had one season (1955-56) with RC Paris in France. He helped Rapid win the Austrian Championship in 1946, 1948, 1951-52, 1954, and 1957, and the Austrian Cup in 1946. However, Happel went on to become better known as a coach, and was regarded as one of the greatest of all time. He started his coaching career in the Netherlands with ADO Den Haag (1962-69) and Feyenoord Rotterdam (1969-73) before moving to Spain with FC Sevilla (1973-74) and then to Belgium’s FC Brügge (1975-78). Happel then took over as chief national coach of the Netherlands in 1978. A return to domestic football saw Happel take over the post at Belgian clubs KRC Harelbeke in 1979, and Standard Lüttich 1979-81. In 1981 he moved to Hamburger SV in the German Bundesliga, staying until 1987. He then returned to Austria coaching FC Swarovski Tirol (1987-91), and finally the Austrian national team, until his death in 1992. As a chief coach Happel had an unenviable level of success. He won a Dutch title with Feyenoord Rotterdam (1971), Belgian titles with FC Brügge (1976-78), German titles with Hamburger SV (1982-83), and Austrian titles with FC Tirol (1989-90). He also won the Dutch Cup with Den Haag (1968), Belgian Cup with Brügge (1977), German Cup with Hamburg (1987), and Austrian Cup with Tirol (1989).

He emigrated to what was then Southern Rhodesia to become a farmer and rancher in Matabeleland and went on to build a successful business empire which included a charter aircraft company. Butler entered politics in the fifties, became a member of the Rhodesian parliament and rose to the leadership of the United Federal Party prior to the 1965 election. It was his party’s defeat in that election that effectively ended his Olympic career as the victory of the Rhodesian Front and its’ policy of continued white minority rule eventually led to the suspension of Rhodesia from the Olympic movement. Butler and partner Christopher Bevan recorded the best performance by their nation before Rhodesia transformed into Zimbabwe when they finished a close fourth in the Flying Dutchman class at the 1960 Rome Olympics. His next appearance, with Anthony Crossley, in 1964 was less successful as they suffered mechanical problems and failed to finish in the top ten. After missing the 1968 Olympics due to Rhodesia’s exclusion he was chosen for the 1972 Olympic regatta in the hope that sanctions against his country would be removed in time for him to participate. He had already started preparations to compete in Kiel when he was killed in a road accident in Belgium that also seriously injured his wife.

He was duly signed as a reserve cox for the rowing squad. Lloyd was educated at Winchester and King’s College, Cambridge. His introduction to fencing came as a result of an injury to a foot that prevented him playing for the Winchester cricket XI. His fencing skills soon developed, and in 1924 he won the revived Public Schools Championship. The last winner, 12 years earlier, was Oswald Mosley, and another famous former winner was Winston Churchill. Lloyd continued fencing at Cambridge, and also coxed for the eight in Boat Race trials. It was as a fencer that he became invincible, however, winning the National Foil Championship a record seven times between 1928-38 including four years in succession 1930-33. At the 1948 London Games Lloyd was the Great Britain flag bearer, and also both a member of the Organising Committee and a competitor. He enjoyed his finest Olympic moment in 1948 when he narrowly missed out on a bronze medal in the individual foil. The first thing he did after his final bout was to apologise to the British team captain Charles de Beaumont. Internationally, Lloyd won three World Championship bronze medals, at team foil in 1931 and 1933, and team sabre in 1933. He was honoured with the OBE, and in 1978 received the Olympic Order of Silver. By profession, Lloyd was a commercial lawyer with a successful international practice.

Known as the man who could break nobody, but who could not be broken, his wins were never spectacular, but his major tour victories were always carefully planned and steadily ridden. Anquetil won the Tour de France five times (1957, 1961-64), the first cyclist to do so, and set a record not broken until Lance Armstrong came along (until Armstrong’s doping disqualifications). Anquetil is one of the five cyclists to win the Tour, the Giro d’Italia and the Vuelta à España, winning the Giro in 1960 and 1964, and the Vuelta in 1963. His great rival in the Tour was Raymond Poulidor, whom he always bested, with their greatest battle coming in the 1964 Tour, as they raced side-by-side up the Puy de Dôme. Near the end, Poulidor dropped Anquetil, who was barely conscious when he fell off his bike, but it was not enough to take the yellow jersey from Anquetil. Anquetil’s only weakness was as a road sprinter. He was an excellent climber, but his forté was as a time trialist, at which, during his career, he was considered the greatest rider ever, winning the Grand Prix des Nations a record nine times. In 1956 he used this ability to set the World Hour Record. His other major victories include the 1966 Liège-Bastogne-Liège; 1964 Gent-Wevelgem; 1957, 1961, 1963, 1965-66 Paris-Nice; 1963-65 Dauphiné-Libéré; and 1965 Bordeaux-Paris. He won the Super Prestige Pernod International trophy in 1961, 1963, and 1965-66, emblematic of the year’s top cyclist. Anquetil is also one of the few professional cyclists who won an Olympic medal as an amateur, having helped France to a bronze in the 1952 team road race. The greatest disappointment of his career is that he never managed to win the world professional road race title, placing second in 1966 for his best finish, his lack of sprinting ability hampering that effort.","Listed in Olympic Cycling Medalists and Tour de France Champions (1952 Olympic Team Road Race (Bronze); 1957, 1961-1964 Tour de France Champion.)

The following year she continued her improvement, reached the final of the European Championships 400 m and also won a silver medal representing her mother’s homeland of Scotland at the Commonwealth Games in Kuala Lumpur. This proved to be the high water mark of her career as a series of knee injuries ruined her chances of improvement.

Competing in many races against professionals in those days, he often outwitted riders from the paid ranks and won such events in 1927 as the Gran Premio Cavaciocchi, Coppa Santagostino, Giro di Romagna, Gran Premio di Treviso and the Coppa Mussolini. The following year, at the 1928 Olympics, Grandi was fourth in both the individual and team road race competition. Grandi turned professional in 1929 and in his début season, won two important races, the Giro dell’Emilia and Coppa Bernocchi. He was also third in the Giro de Calabria and fifth in the Giro d’Italia, won by Alfredo Binda. A great début season was followed in 1930 with some equally impressive results. He finished third in that year’s Giro, won by Luigi Marchisio, but did win the longest stage of the race, the near-300 km stage from Cosenza to Salerno. Grandi won the important Torino-Bruxelles stage race but his finest performance of 1930 was in winning the first stage in the Torino-Zürich race. Almost 400 km long, the stage was held on a very cold day that included the climb up the Gotthard Pass. Dozens of riders withdrew, but Grandi made a solo attack at 90 km, and arrived in Zürich with a gap of 15 minutes ahead of the Austrian Max Bulla, and 21 minutes up on the double winner of the Tour de France, Nicolas Frantz of Luxembourg. At the end of the race, Grandi won by almost 20 minutes from Frantz. Grandi’s latter years as a professional yielded very little success, and appearances in the Tour de France and Giro resulted in him retiring on each occasion.

He attended the Pennsylvania Museum and School of Industrial Art (now the University of the Arts) and the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, and worked in various media including painting, printmaking, photography, theatrical and furniture design. His brothers Angelo and Biagio also became artists. After an automobile accident in 1950, Salvatore Pinto had to abandon most of his artistic techniques and devoted himself increasingly to photography, spending much of his time on Long Beach Island, New Jersey, until his death in 1966. Besides painting, the Pintos also made prints. Salvatore became especially adept at wood engraving. In 1941, he, Angelo and a fourth brother, Joseph, established a photography studio, specializing in color work. Between 1930 and 1933 the three Pinto brothers received scholarships from the Barnes Foundation to travel and paint in southern France. During the 1930s the brothers often worked in a shared studio, traveled together and exhibited jointly, forging a close association between their respective bodies of work. All three brothers painted in both watercolors and oils, and Angelo was asked to teach painting at the Barnes Foundation in 1934. Starting in 1935, Salvatore and Angelo began designing sets and costumes for Catherine Littlefield, director and principal choreographer of the Littlefield Ballet (later called the Philadelphia Ballet). Salvatore produced most of his oeuvre, predominantly prints and woodcuts, during the Great Depression concentrating primarily on portraits and landscapes or city scenes.

Nine years later he finished fourth in the 1912 Polytechnic Harriers full marathon from Windsor Castle to Stamford Bridge stadium, despite holding the lead at 20 miles. The Poly was the Olympic Marathon trial and resulted in Francom’s selection for the Great Britain team but, after being up with the leaders in the early stages of the race in Stockholm, he failed to finish. Francom won the prestigious Hull Marathon, over approximately 20 miles in 1912, 1913 and 1914, setting a new record of 1:54.8 in the first year when he beat 1900 Olympian Jack Rimmer into second place. Also in 1914 he was runner-up in the Northern Counties 10 miles at Belle Vue. Originally Francom was employed as a greenskeeper at the Prenton Golf Club in Birkenhead, and later worked on the railways in North Wirral, running along railway tracks to work, where the distance between the sleepers exactly matched his stride length. A founding member of the Wirral Athletic Club in 1911 he was the senior captain in the year of his Olympic selection. Francom continued racing into the mid-1920s and was the Liverpool & District Cross-Country Champion every year from 1912-23. When he won the race in 1922 his son Arthur finished second. After his racing days were over, Francom enjoyed many successes with his coveted racing pigeons. Personal Best: Mar – 2-42:05.4 (1912).",Cousin of Bert Drury
95509,Tom Mobraaten,Male,19 February 1910,,, Canada,CAN,"Tom Mobraaten was born in Norway and began skiing at the age of six. He moved to Canada in 1930, settling in Vancouver, and, by the middle of the decade, was known on both sides of the border for his success in the sport. He was selected to represent Canada at the 1936 Winter Olympics and entered all four skiing disciplines, although he ended up not starting in alpine skiing’s combined event. His best finish was in ski jumping, the category in which he had been Canadian champion from 1933 through 1935, where he placed 14th among 48 starters. He also finished 31st in the Nordic combined and 57th in cross-country skiing’s 18 km event. He grabbed the Canadian ski jump title again in 1937 and was poised to defend his crown in 1938, but dropped out of the tournament after a dispute with the officials about his disqualification in the downhill. Morbraaten regained the ski jumping title in 1940, but his career was soon interrupted by World War II. He returned to form following the conflict and won the championship once more in 1947, earning a spot on Canada’s delegation to the 1948 Winter Olympics. This time he only participated in ski jumping, placing 44th among 49 competitors. He reduced his schedule of events following the Games, but remained active into the 1950s, briefly competing in the same era as his son, Tom Jr. Outside of sports he was married to Peggy Harlin, a Canadian national champion in the downhill and slalom, and he worked as a mine employee, fisherman, carpenter, and mink farmer.",

28205,Lori Fung,Female,21 February 1963,163.0,43, Canada,CAN,"Lori Fung took up rhythmic gymnastics at the age of 13 and, only one year later, competed in her first Canadian Championships. She did not win it, but she persevered and attended her first World Championships in 1981, placing 30th, which was more representative of Eastern Europe’s domination in the sport than any lack of talent from Fung. She earned her first national title in 1982 and did not relinquish this crown until her 1988 retirement. Moving up to 23rd at the World Championships in 1983, her chances for an Olympic medal were boosted by the Soviet-led boycott of the 1984 Summer Games, but she still faced many strong competitors, most notably Romania’s Doina Stăiculescu, the tournament favorite. In a surprising upset, however, Fung not only medaled, but defeated Stăiculescu and took home the first-ever Olympic gold medal in rhythmic gymnastics. With the return of Eastern Europe, Fung had a respectable ninth-place showing at the 1985 World Championships, the same year that she was made a Member of the Order of Canada. In 1987, on her way to that year’s World Championships, she was struck with appendicitis and forced to abandon the tournament. Although she attempted to qualify for the 1988 Summer Olympics, the lingering effects of the appendicitis, coupled with the Epstein–Barr virus and tendinitis, caused her to retire from active competition. Since then she has worked as a coach and, in addition to the Order of Canada, she has received the Order of British Columbia (1990) and been inducted into the British Columbia Sports (1985) and Canada’s Sports (2004) Halls of Fame.",

She first appeared on the international skating scene at the 1963 World Championships in Karuizawa, where she finished 4th in the 500 m and placed 12th overall. Next year, she participated in the 1964 Olympics. Lydia Skoblikova seemed certain of her fourth title of the Games in the 3000 m, when Han, skating in the last pair, surprisingly matched her split times. Although she faded a little in the second half of the race, Han finished second, tying with Valentina Stenina. As with more North Korean skaters, Han’s international appearances were marked by periods of absence, and little was heard from her between 1968 and her last Olympic appearance in 1972. She did, however, compete in five World Championships, placing 5th in 1965 and winning a distance medal in the 3000 m in 1966. In the 1980s, Han coached Song Hwa-Son, who won a bronze medal at the 1984 World Junior Championships.

8668,George Foreman,Male,10 January 1949,192.0,99, United States,USA,"George Foreman is one of the most powerful punchers in boxing history. He had little experience in 1968 when he won the AAU title, the Olympic trials and the Olympic Games. At Mexico City he became famous when, after winning the final bout, he took a small American flag and waved it to the four corners of the auditorium. It was especially significant given the tenor of the times and the protests of blacks, Tommie Smith and John Carlos, on the Olympic victory platform. Foreman quickly turned professional and began knocking out fighters left and right. In 1973 he fought Joe Frazier for the heavyweight title and punished him – flooring him seven times in the second round before the fight was stopped. Foreman defended the title twice but on 30 October 1974, Muhammad Ali stopped him in “The Rumble in the Jungle” in eight rounds. Foreman was never a championship factor again. He fought thru 1977 and then retired after several discouraging losses. But like the phoenix, in 1987, Foreman was resurrected, resuming his professional boxing career after a 10-year hiatus. He was badly out of shape, over 300 lbs. (136 kg.) when he resumed training, and fighting his first fight at 270 lbs. (123 kg.). In 1994, Foreman stunned the sports world by defeating Michael Moorer for the IBF and WBA heavyweight titles, 20 years after he had lost to Muhammad Ali. Foreman held the titles for less than 2 years and retired again after a lackluster win in 1997 against Lou Savarese. He has since become a very popular commercial spokesman. His career record was 76 wins (68 by KO), and 5 losses.","Listed in Olympic Boxers Who Won a Professional World Championship (Olympics - 1968 Super-heavyweight (Gold); Professional World Champion - Undisputed Heavyweight (1973-1974); IBF & WBA Heavyweight (1994-1995); IBF Heavyweight (1995-1995).)

Educated at Eton College and the University of London, Fox-Pitt excelled in the junior (under 18) and young rider (under 21) age divisions winning European Championship medal in each class. His breakthrough at senior level came in 1994 when he won the Burghley Horse Trails whilst the following year he won the first of his six European Championship team titles.

He won the team silver medal, and Individual bronze medal at the 2014 World Equestrian Games His major disappointments have come at the Olympic Games, most notably in 2004 when his star horse, Tamarillo, was ruled out by injury before the show jumping phase when in a position to challenge for individual honours.

During this time, he made several study trips to European countries. He was dismissed for political reasons in 1933 and settled in Ahrenshoop on the coast of the Baltic Sea. In 1937, 86 of his works were seized and five were shown in the exhibition “Degenerate Art.” Marcks was banned from working and taking part in exhibitions. After World War II, Marcks was named professor at the Hamburg Art School (in 1946) and the Art Working Schools in Köln (in 1950). Marcks was initially an expressionist before he was influenced by Greek archaic art and turned to simpler forms. He designed sculptures, especially human figures and animals, and drew and created woodcuts. In 1953 his most famous work, the statue of the Bremen Town Musicians, was placed in the center of Bremen, followed in 1956 by the Albert Magnus Statue at Albert-Magnus-Square front of the University of Cologne. In 1972 he designed the winners’ medals for the Olympic Games in München. The Runners were designed in the year 1923. Casts of the 19.5 cm high and 22 cm wide group of brass figures are shown in the Sculpture Collection Dresden and the Museum of Modern Art, New York. Only one example was cast in bronze of the Boxers group from the year 1930, in the catalog raisonné under the title Boxers with referee. The whereabouts of the approximately 40 cm high sculpture are unknown. The Swimmer from the year 1933, awarded with an “Honorable Mention” in 1936, is a 167 cm high plaster statue. In 1938, the plaster was revised and formed into a second, much more famous version as a life-size bronze. In 1952, Marcks produced a third version.",

Both competed for Racing Club de France (RCF). Constantin competed for Olympique from 1894-95, then was with Stade Français in 1898-99 and 1900-01, but was with RCF in 1900. He was also a decent athlete, finishing second in the 1900 French Scholastic Championships in the pole vault with a leap of 2.60 metres. Constantin Henriquez was from Haiti and became a doctor of medicine there, although he studied in France at l’École Albert le Grand d’Arcueil. He is credited with introducing football (soccer) to Haiti. Photographs of Constantin Henriquez make it apparent that he was of very dark complexion, and he is often considered the first black Olympian. Although likely a Haitian national in 1900, Constantin Henriquez competed in the 1900 Olympic rugby football competition for Union des Sociétés Français de Sports Athletiques and he was also a member of Stade français in Paris, a French club.",Brother of Alphonse Henríquez

After the Olympics, Eagan returned to Yale Law School. He left there in 1922 to become a Rhodes Scholar at Oxford where he soon made his mark in British amateur boxing circles. At the 1924 Olympics, Eagan chose not to defend his light-heavyweight title but instead weighed in as a heavyweight. He met first the Englishman, Arthur Clifton who had replaced Eagan as British ABA champion. After a grueling three rounds Clifton got the verdict but in doing so, so severely injured his hands that he could not come forward for his second round match. After competing twice in the summer Games, Eagan made his debut at the Olympic Winter Games in Lake Placid. It was here that he made Olympic history when, as a member of the 4-man bobsled team, he added a gold medal to the one he had won at the summer Games twelve years earlier. Eagan obtained a B.A. degree from Oxford in 1928 and in 1932 was admitted to the U.S. Bar. He practiced law untiI the outbreak of World War II when he rejoined the armed forces.

Although he was unbeatable in his region, he was not noticed by Soviet weightlifting officials until he moved to Leningrad (now St. Petersbug) in 1949. At his first Soviet championships tournament in 1952, Lomakin won his first Soviet title in the middle-heavyweight class and was selected to the first Soviet Olympic team. In Helsinki though, Lomakin competed one weight class lower, in light-heavyweight and won a gold medal. Lomakin stayed in the light-heavyweight class nearly his entire career, switching back to middle-heavyweight only near his retirement. In 1952, Lomakin also won the European title and repeated this achievement in 1954, 1956 and 1958, taking silver in 1953. Lomakin also won the 1957 and 1958 World titles, and took World Championships silvers in 1953 and 1954. He also won three Soviet light-heavyweight titles (1953, 1955, 1957) and one more middle-heavyweight title (1960), and added a silver at the 1960 Olympics in middle-heavyweight. Lomakin set 10 world records – two in the press, five in the clean and jerk, and three in the total. Five of his world records were lifted in the light-heavyweight class and five as a middle-heavyweight. Lomakin’s career as a weightlifter and later life was severely hampered by alcoholism. Lomakin was not selected to the Soviet 1956 Olympic team because of his drunken and disrespectful behavior at the pre-Olympic Soviet weightlifter’s gathering in Toshkent. Soon after finishing his sporting career, Lomakin was also dishonorably discharged from the Soviet Army because of his drinking problems. After that, Lomakin was unable to keep any job and fell in with a bad element. At the end of the 1960s Lomakin was arrested while trying to smuggle gold out of the Soviet Union and was convicted to five years in prison. After three years Lomakin was released, but soon after his release, on the dawn of 13 July 1973, his lifeless body was found beneath the 20 metres high vertical wall of the Moscow Young Pioneers Stadium. The police found that Lomakin was heavily drunk when he fell, but it was never resolved whether he fell by himself or was “helped” by one of his numerous criminal associates.",

920526,Tom Purvis,Male,12 June 1888,,, Great Britain,GBR,"Tom Purvis was a British painter and one of the most influential commercial poster artists. His father was Thomas George Purvis, a sailor and marine artist known as T. G. Purvis (1861-1933). Tom Purvis went to Camberwell School of Art and then immediately served six years at the advertising firm of Mather and Crowther, and then learned lithography at the Avenue Press. In World War I Purvis served with the Artists’ Rifles and also produced posters for the Red Cross. In 1923 Purvis started working for the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER) as Advertising Manager. Between 1923 and 1934 he was responsible for over 100 posters, at the rate of one every two months. Many of his compositions for the wide range of clients he had attracted suggest a dynamic use of photography as an aid to composition. During World War II Purvis was an official artist attached to the Ministry of Supply. Purvis later turned to portraiture as others before him had done, and as a devout Roman Catholic, to religious oil paintings. All his works submitted in 1928 were designs for posters. The Water Diver is the design for an advertising poster for the LNER. One copy is in the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) (lithograph, 297 x 196 cm). The other posters can only be derived from the title or subject matter. Summer Sun was also created for the client LNER, and also kept at the MoMA (lithograph, 100.3 x 126.3 cm). The Break – Tennis advertises the British men’s outfitter Austin Reed’s, for whom Purvis also designed an entire series. Posters designed for the Scottish seaside town of Cruden Bay take up the golf theme. A poster with a wink in the eye is The Adventuress, another work for LNER. All were created, as far as is known, in 1928 or shortly before. Some of the works for the 1932 art contests may be parts of a series of 6 posters Purvis again designed for LNER in 1931, which together made a complete picture under the overall title East Coast Joys. In an exhibition catalog, the individual parts are listed under the titles: Walking Tours, Sun Bathing, Safe Sands, Sea Bathing, Sea Fishing, and Sea Sports. In Los Angeles, obviously not the printed posters but the designs were shown. This could explain why Purvis’ works were exhibited in the paintings and not in the prints or posters section.",

Specializing in the backstroke, he made the Canadian national team in 1980, but did not participate in that year’s Summer Olympics, as Canada boycotted the Games. His first major international victory came at the 1982 Commonwealth Games, where he won the 100 metre backstroke and took bronze in the 200 metre version. He repeated his gold medal feat at the 1983 Summer Universiade and finished third in both the 100 and 200 m backstroke events at that year’s Pan American Games. His talents then took him to the 1984 Summer Olympics, where he captured bronze in the 100 m backstroke and earned silver in the 4x100 metre medley relay (alongside Victor Davis, Sandy Goss, and Tom Ponting). He also placed second in the B Final and tenth overall in the 200 m backstroke. He went on to win a pair of silver medals, in the 100 and 200 m backstroke events, at the 1985 Pan Pacific Games, before moving on to the 1986 Commonwealth Games, where he earned bronze in the 100 m and gold in the 4x100 m relay (with Baumann, David, Goss, Ponting, Mark Tewksbury, and the non-Olympians Claude Lamy and Darcy Wallingford).

In 2002 at the Pan-Pacifics, she was more dominant, winning six medals, four gold, with three individual championships in the 100 free, 100 fly, and 100 back. Coughlin was an early favorite for the 2004 Olympics, but her performance in 2003, and especially at the World Championships, was lackluster. There she won only two relay medals, although it was later revealed that she was quite sick and had considered not competing. Although somewhat overshadowed by the media attention given Michael Phelps, Coughlin was the top female swimmer at the 2004 Olympic Games, winning five medals, including two gold. Individually, she won the 100 metre backstroke and finished third in the 100 freestyle. She won her second gold medal in the 800 metre freestyle relay, and added two silvers as a member of the United States’ teams in the other relays. Coughlin continued after 2004 and won a 4x200 freestyle relay gold medal at the 2005 World Championships. In 2007, she won the 100 backstroke and 200 freestyle at the Worlds, adding a gold medal in the 4x2 free relay. In Beijing, she was again eclipsed by the frenzy that surrounded American swimmers Michael Phelps and Dara Torres. But she competed in six events, winning a medal in all of them, highlighted by an individual gold medal in the 100 backstroke, becoming the first woman to defend that Olympic title. In three Olympics, she competed in 12 events and won 12 medals, three gold. This gives her an unusual Olympic record, which she shares with Paavo Nurmi, of having entered the most Olympic events while winning a medal in all of them.","Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the Summer Pan American Games (1–2–1 2015 Toronto SWI gold: 4×100 m medley relay, silver: 100 m freestyle and 4×100 m freestyle relay, bronze: 50 m freestyle) Listed in Olympians Who Set a World Record in Long Course Swimming (100 m backstroke – 13 August 2002 - 11 August 2008: 59.58 (13 August 2002; Fort Lauderdale, USA), 59.44 (27 March 2007; Melbourne, AUS), 59.21 (17 February 2008; Columbia, USA), 59.03 (30 June 2008; Omaha, USA), 58.97 (1 July 2008; Omaha, USA); 4×200 m freestyle relay – 18 August 2004 - 3 August 2006 and 29 March 2007 - 14 August 2008: 7:53.42 (18 August 2004; Athina, GRE), 7:50.09 (29 March 2007; Melbourne, AUS)) Listed in Olympians Who Set a World Record in Short Course Swimming (100 m backstroke – 29 November 2001 - 22 February 2009: 57.08 (29 November 2001; East Meadow, USA), 56.71 (23 November 2002; East Meadow, USA), 56.51 (28 October 2007; Singapore, SGP); 200 m backstroke – 27 November 2001 - 23 February 2008: 2:03.62 (27 November 2001; East Meadow, USA); 100 m butterfly – 22 November 2002 - 28 August 2006: 56.34 (22 November 2002; East Meadow, USA); 100 m medley – 23 November 2002 - 10 August 2009: 58.80 (23 November 2002; East Meadow, USA); 4×100 m medley relay – 16 December 2011 - 11 December 2015: 3:45.56 (16 December 2011; Atlanta, USA)) Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the Pan Pacific Swimming Championships (11–4–1 2002 Yokohama gold: 100 m freestyle, 100 m backstroke, 100 m butterfly, and 4×200 m freestyle relay, silver: 4×100 m freestyle relay and 4×100 m medley relay; 2006 Victoria gold: 100 m freestyle, 4×100 m freestyle relay, 4×200 m freestyle relay, and 4×100 m medley relay, silver: 50 m freestyle, 100 m backstroke; 2010 Irvine gold: 100 m freestyle, 4×100 m freestyle relay, and 4×100 m medley relay, bronze: 100 m backstroke) Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the World Aquatics Championships (8–7–5 2001 Fukuoka SWI gold: 100 m backstroke and 4×200 m freestyle relay, silver: 4×100 m medley relay, bronze: 50 m backstroke; 2003 Barcelona SWI gold: 4×100 m freestyle relay, silver: 4×100 m medley relay; 2005 Montréal SWI gold: 4×200 m freestyle relay, silver: 100 m freestyle and 4×100 m medley relay, bronze: 100 m backstroke and 4×100 m freestyle relay; 2007 Melbourne SWI gold: 100 m backstroke and 4×200 m freestyle relay, silver: 4×100 m freestyle relay and 4×100 m medley relay, bronze: 100 m butterfly; 2011 Shanghai SWI gold: 4×100 m medley relay, silver: 4×100 m freestyle relay, bronze: 100 m backstroke; 2013 Barcelona SWI gold: 4×100 m freestyle relay) Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the World Short-Course Swimming Championships (25 m) (2–6–1 2008 Manchester silver: 4×100 m medley relay; 2010 Dubai gold: 100 m backstroke, silver: 4×100 m freestyle relay and 4×100 m medley relay, bronze: 100 m freestyle; 2014 Doha gold: 4×50 m freestyle mixed relay (swam in heats only), silver: 4×50 m freestyle relay, 4×100 m freestyle relay, and 4×50 m medley relay)"

His rise to the top mirrored his nation’s emergence from also-rans to the top of track cycling. Hoy won his first Olympic medal as part of the team sprint at the Sydney Games and then turned his attention to the kilometre time trial. This move proved successful as he won the world title in 2002 and 2004 before winning gold at the Athens Olympics. The kilometre was removed from the Olympic programme for the 2008 Games so Hoy was forced to change to other track sprinting events. His switch proved very successful as led the very successful British cycling team at the 2008 Beijing Olympics, with three gold medals. After anchoring the British team sprint squad to the title, Hoy dominated the match sprint and keirin competitions to win three gold medals, the best track cycling performance at a single Olympics since Marcus Hurley in 1904. For this performance and others he was a given a knighthood by Queen Elizabeth in the 2009 New Year Honours List and was voted his nation’s sports person of the year. Hoy retained his team sprint and keirin titles at the 2012 London Olympics, where he was the Great Britain flagbearer, and in the process became the most successful Olympic cyclist in history with six gold medals. However, his record was equaled by fellow Briton Jason Kenny at Rio in 2016. After the 2012 Games Hoy shared the overall cycling medal record of 7 with Bradley Wiggins but Wiggins went on to win a record eighth medal in 2016. Hoy’s world championship record is equally impressive as he won 11 gold medals, 8 silver and 6 bronze between 1999 and 2012. He also has the unique distinction of having won world and Olympic titles in all four sprinting disciplines (individual sprint, time trial, keirin and team sprint). The velodrome built for the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow is named in his honour. Hoy retired from competitive cycling in 2013 and went into business promoting his HOY Bikes, cycling accessories and clothing. He also wrote a series of children’s books entitles Flying Fergus. In June 2016 he took part in, and completed, the grueling Le Mans 24-Hour motor race. He was also an integral part of the BBC commentary and pundit team for the 2014 Commonwealth Games and 2016 Rio Olympics.","Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the British Empire/Commonwealth Games (2–0–2 2002 Manchester CYC gold: 1000 m time trial, bronze: team sprint (competed for Scotland); 2006 Melbourne CYC gold: team sprint, bronze: 1000 m time trial (competed for Scotland)) Listed in Olympians Who Participated in 24 Hours of Le Mans Races (1 race - 2016 (17th) with Ligier-Nissan) Listed in Olympian Members of the Nobility (Sir)"

Four years later in Amsterdam, he won another gold in the épée event. After four preliminary matches with eight individual wins and losses he was not selected for the final pool, which Italy won ahead of France. Bertinetti also won one silver medal in the individual sabre at the 1929 European Championships. Earlier in his career, he was also a prominent football player. One of the founders of Pro Vercelli’s football section, he played on the team that won the Italian title in 1908.

In World War I, he served three years at the Russian-Albanian front and was decorated with the Golden Cross of Merit. After the war, he worked as a freelance artist. Kaufmann took part in the exhibition of the Wiener (Vienna) Secession and was a member of the Sonderbund Österreichischer Künstler (Separate League of Austrian Artists). From 1927, was also a member of the Hagenbund, one of the most progressive associations. Both were liquidated after the 1938 Austrian Anschluss into Nazi Germany. From 1938-45 Kaufmann was subjected to a professional ban, and he was conscripted as an unskilled laborer in a gear factory. From 1945-56 Kaufmann headed the painting section of the professional association of visual artists and participated in the Antifascist exhibition “Never forget!” in Wien in 1946. In the same year he became a member of the Wiener Secession. In 1948 he was commissioned by the municipality of Wien to paint two portraits of the gold medal winner in the javelin throw, Herma Bauma. In 1949, Kaufmann was promoted to Professor. Beginning in 1950, he became a member of the Vienna Visual Artists Association. He received an Honorary Diploma for Painting and Graphics on the occasion of the 1952 Helsinki Olympic Games, where he submitted four works to the exhibition that substituted for the previously contested art competitions: Skier, Ice Hockey, Soccer Scene in Indian ink and another oil painting entitled Soccer. Skier and Ice Hockey are clearly documented in respective sources. There were several oil paintings, however, created by Kaufmann around 1950 showing Soccer scenes. Here the correlation is uncertain. Kaufmann died of the effects of a pneumonia. Kaufmann based his paintings on the intrinsic value and expressive power of color, developing his dynamic line mostly after World War II. He preferred to paint outdoors, particularly on excursions to Italy, France and Croatia, creating views depicted in glowing colors. From 1948 he captured scenes from the world of sport, fascinated by the movement and dynamic, and a further important theme group was his depictions of everyday scenes. Kaufmann himself stayed active with speed skating and table tennis.",

He was from the Schwarzwald (Black Forest) together with Helmut Hagg, Herbert Steinbeißer and upcoming Walter Demel. Weiß won four national titles over 50 km and took part in four Olympic Games between 1956-68. He then started for the mixed German team from 1956-64, and for West Germany in 1968. Long distance ski runs to school and hard work on his parents’ farm brought him the background for top-level long distance skiing. In 1960 at Squaw Valley he was close to his greatest sport moment when he held a good result at the first intermediate time, but then waxing problems dropped him down to 24th place at race end. In 1972 Weiß retired and went back to farming. He later criticized skating style as “an unnatural moving style.”",

After spending several years in North America earlier, John emigrated to the United States in 1889, where he opened an office in Seattle. In 1894, after the economic panic of 1893, he moved to Los Angeles. Donald was introduced into his father’s company in 1920. Both were responsible for designing many of Los Angeles’ finest buildings, which became some of the city’s most enduring landmarks, including LA City Hall and the Coliseum, Union Station and Bullocks Wilshire, the most complete design of Art Deco in the United States. The Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum has hosted two Olympic Games, in 1932 and in 1984; the Games are to be held there again in 2028. The first Super Bowl in American Football was also played there in 1967. The stadium was built in 1921-23 in a neoclassical style for 75,000 spectators, but was expanded to seating for 100,000 spectators in 1930 for the upcoming Olympic Games. At this time the iconic bowl for the Olympic fire was placed on the portico. In 1984 it was declared a National Historic Landmark and was renovated in 1993. In 1994 the building was damaged by an earthquake and restored again. The name is said to commemorate the veterans of World War I.",Son of John Parkinson

She won her first Alberta provincial championship in 1993 as the skip (captain) of her own team, but eleven years would pass before she won another in 2004. During this time she won no major tournaments, but did finish as runner-up at the 1997 Olympic trials, losing in the final match to Sandra Schmirler rink. The year of her second provincial championship was also the year that she took the 2004 Canadian Mixed Curling Championships, which put helped put her on the sport’s national map as the first woman to win that tournament as skip. Perhaps her greatest victory, however, came the following year at the 2005 Olympic trials where, despite going 1-3 for her first four matches, she took the event after winning the next seven games. At the 2006 Winter Olympic curling tournament she brought home a bronze medal against a field of strong teams. Since the Olympics she has remained an active and successful competitor, winning the 2008 Alberta Provincial Championship and coming in as runner-up at both the 2008 Canadian Championship and the 2009 Olympic trials.

Lazakovich had a short career in the international sporting arena. She won gold at the team event at the 1970 World Championships. In 1971, at the European Championships, Lazakovich won three golds (individual all-around, uneven bars, balance beam) and two silvers (vault and floor exercise). The last international tournament for Lazakovich was the 1972 Olympics, where she won gold in team event, silver in balance beam and bronzes in individual all-around and floor exercise. Lazakovich was also Soviet champion in individual all-around (1971), balance beam (1970) and uneven bars (1971). Lazakovich ended her sporting career shortly after the 1972 Olympics, although only 18-years-old. Her retirement was quite abrupt and no official cause was given although there were rumors that Lazakovich had tried to defect to the West during the Olympics, but had been stopped by agents. After her retirement, Lazakovich worked as a gymnastics coach in her hometown Vitebsk. But she had stated in interviews that the coaching job did not suit her, lacking the patience and consistency to be a good coach. Unhappiness with her life led her to alcoholism, which resulted in several jail sentences. Although Lazakovich frequently sought treatment for her alcoholism, she died from alcohol-related causes at only 38-years-old.","Listed in Olympians Who Were Sent to Prison (Unhappiness with her life led her to alcoholism, which resulted in several jail sentences.)"

During the late 1930s he won several prizes for his works including the Best Diploma Award. He was awarded the Delano and Aldrich/Emerson Fellowship to travel and study in the United States to a French architect. During his stay he taught at the University of Oregon and Washington State. He wrote the book “Voyage d’Amerique” where he published his letters, and some biographical notes, during an American trip between 9 February and 2 August 1939. In France, he worked in the ateliers of Pierre Leprince-Ringuet, Emmanuel Pontremoli and André Leconte. Ardilouze died in 1944 in a plane crash near Brives in Central France, four years before he “participated” in London. The joint project of the three architects Guy Ardilouze, Jean Démaret and Othello Zavaroni was a local sports center for the training of future top athletes. It was built on a former estate near the castle of Boivre. The planning began in 1942. Although it is not confirmed that the construction was carried out according to the plans of these three architects, that seems very likely.

Standing six feet three inches tall, Terry could throw a football further than most men could kick it. He used that skill in the water as goalkeeper of the Middlesex water polo team. After an excellent performance for Corinthians against Sunderland in 1934, the first division club offered him a professional contract but professional football was far from the attraction it is today and he declined the offer. He did later join Arsenal as an amateur but spent all his time in their reserves. Having won an Amateur Cup winners’ medal with Casuals in 1936, he was selected for the Great Britain Olympic squad to go to the Berlin Olympics but Haydn Hill was preferred to Huddle in goal for Britain’s two games against China and Poland. Huddle toured New Zealand, Australia and Ceylon (now Sri Lanka) with the England amateur team in 1937 and then during the war spent most of his time serving in the Far East. Having not seen his wife Margaret in all that time, he was saddened when she died in her sleep only a few months after his return.

Derek intended to follow his family in both pursuits but, after entering the University of Manitoba in 1939 to pursue a business degree, his life was interrupted by World War II, during which time he served in the Royal Canadian Navy. Riley graduated from his program following the conflict and, while involving himself in the business world, joined the Winnipeg Rowing Club.

In Helsinki, they came in last in both the opening round and the repêchage and were therefore eliminated. Riley had a lucrative career in business, but rowing remained a passion for most of his life as well. He continued to compete into his 40s and took part in Masters Championships until he was 75, even winning a title in 1985.

51218,Dara Torres,Female,15 April 1967,183.0,68, United States,USA,"Dara Torres had the longest successful career of any Olympic swimmer, one which saw her win 12 Olympic medals and four gold medals. Torres began her career in 1984, winning a gold medal in the 4×100 freestyle relay. She added a silver and bronze in relays in 1988, and seemingly ended her swimming career with another gold in the 4×100 free relay in 1992. Tall and attractive, Torres then began a career as a model, becoming the first athlete to appear in Sports Illustrated’s swimsuit issue. She also achieved notice as a commercial spokeswoman on an infomercial for a fitness training method. But in late 1998, she elected to return to competitive swimming. With little time to prepare, she returned to the Olympic pool at Sydney, and won five medals, including two golds in relays. She won three individual bronze medals at Sydney – in the 50 free, the 100 free, and the 100 fly. Again retiring after the 2000 Olympics, Torres did not compete in Athina. But in 2006 she began training to make another Olympic team and made the US team for Beijing, winning the Olympic Trials in both the 50 and 100 metre freestyle. But she elected to compete in Beijing only in the 50 and the 4×100 freestyle and medley relays. Aged 41, the oldest ever female Olympic swimmer, Torres won a silver medal in the 50 free, defeated by only 1/100th of a second. She added silver medals in both relays. Torres finished her Olympic career lacking only an individual gold medal. She swam through 2012, but just missed out making the US Olympic team for the London Olympics. Torres won four Olympic medals of each color, one of only three Olympians to have won four or more medals of each type (Takashi Ono of Japan, and Larisa Latynina in gymnastics are the others).","Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the Summer Pan American Games (1–0–0 1983 Caracas SWI gold: 4×100 m freestyle relay) Listed in Olympians Who Set a World Record in Long Course Swimming (4×100 m freestyle relay – 28 July 1992 - 7 September 1994 and 16 September 2000 - 29 July 2002: 3:39.46 (28 July 1992; Barcelona, ESP), 3:36.61 (16 September 2000; Sydney, AUS); 4×100 m medley relay – 23 September 2000 - 21 August 2004: 3:58.30 (23 September 2000; Sydney, AUS)) Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the Pan Pacific Swimming Championships (3–0–0 1987 Brisbane gold: 100 m freestyle, 4×100 m freestyle relay, and 4×100 m medley relay) Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the World Aquatics Championships (0–1–0 1986 Madrid SWI silver: 4×100 m freestyle relay)"

He is one of only four men to have won three Olympic gold medals in wrestling (the others being Ivar Johansson, SWE, Aleksandr Medved, URS, and Carl Westergren, SWE). A frighteningly strong man, he won his first gold medal in 1988 in the super-heavyweight Greco-Roman class, competing for the Soviet Union. He defended that title in 1992, competing for the Unified Team, and in 1996, wrestled for Russia. Karelin was also favored to win his fourth consecutive gold medal in 2000 but, in a major upset, he lost in the final, 1-0, to unheralded American Rulon Gardner. Before this loss, Karelin had been undefeated for 13 years, his last defeat being to Igor Rostorotsky at the 1987 Soviet Championships, and had not lost a point in a match in six years. Karelin took up wrestling in 1980 and made the Soviet national team in 1987 after winning the World Junior Championships in 1985 and 1987 and the European Junior Championships in 1986. In addition to his Olympic medals, Karelin, who competed in Greco-Roman super-heavyweight class his entire career, was World Champion in 1989-91, 1993-95, and 1997-99. His 12 championships in the Olympic and World events are the most ever, breaking the mark held by Medved. He also won European titles from 1988-96 and 1998-2000 and the 1987 World Cup and was a 13-time Soviet, CIS and Russian champion from 1988-2000. In 1989, 1990, 1992 and 1994, Karelin was elected as the best wrestler of the year and he carried the Soviet flag in 1988, the Unified Team’s flag in 1992, and the Russian flag at the 1996 Olympic Opening Ceremonies. He was also twice named the best Russian athlete of the year. Karelin retired from sports after the 2000 Olympics and graduated from the Siberian Academy of Physical Culture with a Ph.D. in pedagogy in 2002. From 1995-99 Karelin worked with the Russian police force (militsiya) and, in 1999, was invited into politics by Russian president Vladimir Putin. Joining the United Russia party, Karelin was elected as a member of the Russian parliament (Duma) in 1999 and was re-elected in 2003, 2007 and 2011. In 2007 he became a member of the Duma’s committee on international affairs. In 2003 Karelin was one of the first 10 inductees elected to the FILA International Wrestling Hall of Fame.

Overall, he won a stunning 41 world titles, and a grand total of 69 World Championship medals. Stäheli excelled in both rifle and pistol shooting, which allowed him to amass this large number of victories. His most notable title came in 1909 in Hamburg, when Stäheli became the first man to break the 1000 points barrier in the free rifle event. This World Record also helped the Swiss team beat the French by just two points. Remarkably, Stäheli only took part in two Olympics, in 1900 (which doubled as the World Championships) and 1906, winning four titles. (Some sources also include the individual free rifle events in 1906, in which Stäheli won three medals, but no medals were awarded in these competitions). For reasons unknown, the very successful Swiss marksmen did not compete in 1908 and 1912. After the First World War, he no longer competed in major events, and dedicated himself to raising interest in his favourite sport and training youngsters.","Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the World Shooting Championships (41–17–11 1898 Torino gold: 300 m free rifle kneeling, bronze: 300 m free rifle 3 positions and 300 m free rifle 3 positions team; 1899 Loosduinen gold: 300 m free rifle 3 positions team and 300 m free rifle kneeling; 1900 Paris (Olympics) gold: 50 m free pistol team, 300 m free rifle kneeling, and 300 m free rifle 3 positions team, bronze: 50 m free pistol; 1901 Luzern gold: 50 m free pistol team and 300 m free rifle kneeling, silver: 300 m free rifle 3 positions; 1902 Roma gold: 300 m free rifle 3 positions team, 300 m free rifle kneeling, and 50 m free pistol team, silver: 50 m free pistol, bronze: 300 m free rifle 3 positions; 1904 Lyon gold: 300 m free rifle 3 positions, 300 m free rifle 3 positions team, and 50 m free pistol team, silver: 300 m free rifle kneeling and 300 m free rifle standing; 1905 Bruxelles gold: 300 m free rifle 3 positions team, silver: 300 m free rifle 3 positions and 50 m free pistol team; 1906 Milano gold: 300 m free rifle 3 positions team and 50 m free pistol, silver: 300 m free rifle prone and 50 m free pistol team, bronze: 300 m free rifle kneeling; 1907 Zürich gold: 300 m free rifle 3 positions and 300 m free rifle 3 positions team, silver: 300 m free rifle kneeling and 50 m free pistol team, bronze: 300 m free rifle prone and 50 m free pistol; 1908 Wien gold: 300 m free rifle 3 positions team; 1909 Hamburg gold: 300 m free rifle 3 positions, 300 m free rifle prone, and 300 m free rifle 3 positions team, silver: 300 m free rifle kneeling and 50 m free pistol team, bronze: 50 m free pistol; 1910 Loosduinen gold: 300 m free rifle kneeling and 300 m free rifle 3 positions team, silver: 300 m free rifle 3 positions; 1911 Roma gold: 300 m free rifle 3 positions, free rifle kneeling, 300 m free rifle prone, 300 m free rifle standing, and 300 m free rifle 3 positions team, bronze: 50 m free pistol team; 1912 Biarritz gold: 300 m free rifle 3 positions, free rifle kneeling, 300 m free rifle prone, and 300 m free rifle 3 positions team, bronze: 300 m free rifle standing and 300 m military rifle 3 positions; 1913 Camp Perry gold: 300 m free rifle 3 positions, 300 m free rifle kneeling, and 300 m free rifle 3 positions team, silver: 300 m free rifle prone and 300 m free rifle standing; 1914 Viborg gold: 300 m free rifle kneeling, 300 m free rifle prone, and 300 m free rifle 3 positions team, silver: 300 m free rifle 3 positions and 300 m free rifle standing)"

Due to his myopia he was forced to wear glasses even on the field, which gave him a disadvantage in the aerial game. As one of the best players, the right winger won promotion to Serie B with Udinese in 1930 and contributed to avoiding relegation. He played for several other clubs in Serie B, notably Padova, until he was discovered by the legendary coach Vittorio Pozzo for the 1936 Olympic tournament. Frossi became the tournament’s top scorer with seven goals, scoring in all four games. He scored the decisive goal in the first game against the United States, a hat-trick against Japan, the 2-1 goal in extra time of the semifinal against Norway and two goals that earned victory against Austria in the final. After the Olympics Frossi made only one appearance each with the national A-team and B-team, both in 1937. In 1936 he had joined Inter-Milano, with whom he played actively until 1942, winning two Italian Championships and one Cup. In 147 appearances he scored 49 goals. During World War II he played briefly for Pro Patria and Como, ending his active career in 1945. After his active career Frossi coached a considerable number of teams, including Inter-Milano for a short period in the 1956-57 season. Even though his team was victorious in 11 of 12 matches he was dismissed because his defensive tactics of 5-4-1 were not accepted. His system was a predecessor of the famous Italian “catanaccio” (lock-out), which was further developed in the 1960s. Frossi held a degree in law and worked as an office manager at Alfa Romeo. Towards the end of his life he was a columnist for the newspaper Corriere della Sera in Milan.

95693,Eero Mäntyranta,Male,20 November 1937,170.0,65, Finland,FIN,"Eero Mäntyranta, probably the most successful Finnish cross-country skier ever, competed at four Olympic Winter Games (1960-1972), winning cross-country skiing medals at three of them. A member of the Finnish 4 x 10 km relay team from 1960-68, he won gold in 1960, silver in 1964, and a bronze in 1968. At his peak in 1964, Mäntyranta won both the 15 km and 30 km and added a silver and a bronze in these two events in 1968 to bring his total medal haul to seven. He was also World champion at 30 km in 1962 and 1966, won relay silvers in both these championships and added a bronze in the 50 km in 1966. He also won the 15 km at Holmenkollen thrice (1962, 1964, 1968) and 15 km at Lahti twice (1964, 1972). Mäntyranta won five Finnish Championships, was selected as the Finnish Sportsman of the Year in both 1964 and 1966 and was awarded the Holmenkollen medal in 1964. By the time of his fourth Olympic appearance in 1972, he was past his prime and was selected only for the 30 km, in which he finished 19th. His career ended soon afterwards when he became the first Finnish sportsman to have tested positive for doping. Mäntyranta actually had tested positive for amphetamines at the 1972 Finnish Championships before the Sapporo Games, but the result was hushed up. The fact came to light after the Olympic Winter Games, but it has been always denied by Mäntyranta, although he later admitted taking hormones, which during his sports career were not yet prohibited. Interestingly, Mäntyranta suffered from a medical condition termed primary familial congenital polycythemia (PFCP), which gives one a very high hematocrit, or red blood cell count. Normal hematocrits for men are 40-45 but Mäntyranta’s was as high as 60-65, giving his blood increased oxygen carrying capacity, which likely contributed to his success in the aerobic sport of cross-country skiing.","Uncle of Pertti Teurajärvi Listed in Olympians Who Were Awarded the Holmenkollmedaljen (1964) Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the World Nordic Ski Championships (5–4–3 1960 Squaw Valley (Olympics) CCS gold: 4×10 km relay; 1962 Zakopane CCS gold: 30 km, silver: 4×10 km relay; 1964 Innsbruck (Olympics) CCS gold: 15 km and 30 km, silver: 4×10 km relay; 1966 Oslo CCS gold: 30 km, silver: 4×10 km relay, bronze: 50 km; 1968 Grenoble (Olympics) CCS silver: 15 km, bronze: 30 km and 4×10 km relay)"

In 1901 she married the advertising manager John Maltwood. From his fortune she was able to concentrate on her art and her interests in ancient history, mythology, Egyptian culture, philosophy, theosophy and Buddhism. They travelled frequently to European countries, the Far East, Northern Africa and both Southern and Northern America. Artistically, she was close to the French symbolists, the Vienna Secession, and Art Nouveau. In 1927 she discovered the Glastonbury Zodiac, the most remarkable ancient earthen work in Great Britain on the fields where the tales of King Arthur and his Twelve Knights and their Original Round Table had transpired. In 1938 she and her husband moved to Victoria, Canada, because of their disillusionment with Europe. After her retirement Maltwood founded her own museum. The Official Report lists a work submitted by Katherine Maltwood entitled L’Idée Sportive. However, it is probably a title adapted for the occasion.

Morgan won the welterweight division at the Olympic Games in Amsterdam in 1928, despite dislocating a finger of his left hand when sparring in London a week before the Games. Morgan was left-handed — a southpaw — which made the injury even more critical to his chances. Morgan protected the hand as much as he could during his first three bouts, each of which he won on points, but could contain himself no longer in the final. He hit his opponent, Argentine Paul Landini, with his left but Morgan thought he suffered more. The final went the distance but Landini congratulated and hugged Morgan before the unanimous decision was announced.

At the age of 20, he opened an artist’s workshop in the bazaar of Tehran and initially painted traditional miniatures, some of which were sold by others as fake antiques. In 1934, he went to Paris for more than a year and studied various painting styles in museums. Based on this, Behzad developed a new style of miniature painting. Combining traditional Persian painting with contemporary painting of the West, he tried to save Persian miniature painting from oblivion. He also illustrated classics of Persian literature. Behzad subsequently became internationally known and received awards at home and abroad. In 1946, he started working for the Bastan Museum, where he later organized an internationally acclaimed exhibition of Iranian art. At the same time, he taught at the Art Academy in Tehran. In 1955, he had a solo exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art in Paris, and one year later 50 of his miniatures were exhibited at the Library of Congress in Washington. In 1968, Behzad fell ill and went to Europe for treatment twice. Nevertheless, he died the same year. In 1994, a new museum was opened for him in Tehran which keeps a large collection of his works. Iranian sources mention his two watercolors submitted in 1952 under the titles Polo and The death of the white demon has reached me! while they are listed in the Official Report and the catalog as Archer and Fight between Rostam (Iranian Hero) and Devil. Interestingly, there are several works by Behzad showing Polo motifs, but none with an Archer. The title of the second work has probably been adapted to a western audience. Painted in 1947 it shows a scene from the Book of Kings (Shāhnāme), the national epic of the Persian-speaking world by Abū ʾl-Qāsim Firdausī.",

He was most successful in the Nordic combined, placing 39th among 46 finishers in the individual event, and was 47th of 75 starters in the 18 km cross-country ski. He was entered into two other events, combined alpine skiing and the 50 km cross-country ski, but did not complete the slalom portion of the former and failed to start the latter. Clark earned one more major distinction by becoming the Canadian alpine skiing champion in 1939 and then retired from competition. He remained active in the sport, however, and founded a ski resort in Gatineau, which eventually named a slope in his honor. He was also involved in administrative aspects, serving as Chairman of the technical committee of the Canada Amateur Ski Association from 1950-1951, and then as the body’s president from 1952-1959.

After three years, when the Allied troops liberated Albania, Greco joined the American Red Cross. Greco later taught in Carrara, Napoli and Roma. Later, he worked in München, Salzburg and even stayed in Iran for some time. He was one of the most important European sculptors of the 20th century; in particular his complicated movement patterns in his female nudes were unique. In addition, he also was an esteemed lithographer and etcher. From 1962-64, Greco designed and constructed the bronze doors of the Orvieto Cathedral. He was also known for his literary production and poetry, and lithographs and etchings, amongst others on Italian stamps. His sculpture Lottatore in Riposo (Fighter in Rest) won Honorable Mention in the art competitions at the 1948 London Olympics in the category Mixed Statues. The bronze figure from 1947 is 30 x 21 x 18 cm in size. A large version (Grande Lottatore) was created shortly afterwards in the format 93 x 90 x 61 cm. Two of its bronze castings are in Auckland and Antwerp. Probably the original version was presented on the III. National Sports Inspired Art Exhibition at the National Gallery of Modern Art in Roma and then at the Tate Gallery in London. Since the British art critic Neville Wallis in “Punch” described Greco’s work as a “bronze statuette”, it was apparently the first and smaller version. In 1960 Greco created the commemorative medal for the Olympic Games in Roma. In 2013, to commemorate the centenary of Greco’s birth, Poste Italiane issued a postage stamp entitled Vittoria Olimpica, taken from a 1960 sculpture located in the square of the Palazzo dello Sport in Roma.",

In second entering the Alps, with Pedro Delgado close in 3rd, Roche fell off the pace as Delgado attacked up the Villard de Lans. Delgado took over the race, and was the leader on the road, as he opened up a huge margin. But Roche countered and closed to within four seconds of Delgado at the finish. It was an almost superhuman effort which earned him the yellow jersey but also put him in the hospital overnight, requiring oxygen for recovery. However, he recovered enough to race the next day and keep the yellow jersey into Paris. Roche’s career was hampered by knee problems both before 1987 and in the ensuing years. His other major victories included the 1981 Paris-Nice race, the Tour of Romandie in 1983-84, 1987; the 1989 Vuelta al País Vasco, and Four Days of Dunkirk in 1990.

He is perhaps best known for his comments to the Tour organizers during the 1910 race, while he ascended the Col du Tourmalet, noting, “Vous êtes des assassins! Oui, des assassins [You are murderers. Yes, murderers.]” In World War I, Lapize served as a sergeant in the 13th Regiment Artillery, and then transferred to the French Flying Corps as a fighter pilot.

Baker ran for Cambridge and joined the Cambridge Athletic Club. He represented Haverford in the IC4A championships in 1907, finishing fifth in the 880 yards. For Cambridge he won the 880 yards against Oxford in 1910, 1911, and 1912, and the mile in 1909 and 1911. At the Cambridge University AC sports days, he won the mile in 1910 and both the half-mile and mile in 1911 and 1912. He ran three times at the AAA Championships, finishing fifth in the 1910 mile, fourth in the 1911 mile, and participating on the winning medley relay team in 1920. Baker eventually ran for Great Britain at the 1912 and 1920 Olympic Games. At Stockholm, he failed to survive the first round of the 800 metres. In the 1,500 metres, he qualified for the final, but sacrificed his own chances to pace his teammate, Arnold Jackson. Jackson won the gold medal, and Baker finished sixth. At Antwerp in 1920, Baker again ran in the 800 metres. He qualified for the semi-finals, but did not start in that round. In the 1,500 metres, he ran well, but was narrowly beaten by his teammate, Albert Hill, and earned a silver medal. Baker’s fame came from his career after sports. As a Quaker pacifist, he rejected combat service in World War I, but commanded the Friends’ Ambulance Corps, serving at the front in France, and earning decorations for valor. He was later an adjutant in a British ambulance unit in Italy, and earned the British Silver Medal for Military Valor, and the Italian War Cross. In 1915, Philip Baker married Irene Noel, and would eventually take her name, being known as Philip Noel-Baker from the late thirties onward. They eventually had one child, Francis, a son born in 1920. After the war, Noel-Baker was an assistant to Robert Cecil at the Paris Peace Conference and he helped draft the Covenant of the League of Nations. He was later named chief assistant to the secretary-general of the League, Eric Drummond, until 1922. During this time, he became associated with Fridtjof Nansen, the Norwegian explorer and humanitarian, who became known for his work on behalf of war refugees. In 1924, Noel-Baker became Sir Ernest Cassell Professor of international relations at the University of London. He was elected to Parliament from Coventry in 1929, serving two years. In 1926 he wrote two books, The League of Nations at Work, and Disarmament, which earned him a reputation as an expert on disarmament. He was later (1932) appointed the parliamentary private secretary to Arthur Henderson, chairman of the World Disarmament Conference convened in Geneva in 1932. He was re-elected to Parliament in 1936 and held a seat representing Derby until 1970. During World War II, Noel-Baker served as official spokesman for the War Ministry in the House of Commons. In 1945, when the Labour Party returned to power, he was made minister of state, a non-cabinet position under the foreign secretary. In that capacity, he headed the British delegation to the United Nations Preparatory Commission, and later served on the subcommittee that drew up the preliminary agenda for the United Nations General Assembly. He served as Secretary of State for Air from 1946-1947, and Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations from 1947-1950. Noel-Baker was a forceful advocate of arms control, and later served on the U.N. Economic and Social Council. His final book was published in 1958, The Arms Race: A Programme for World Disarmament. It was a comprehensive analysis of the history of disarmament with practical suggestions for the future course of the policy, and in 1960 was awarded the Albert Schweitzer Book Prize. In 1959, for his work with the League of Nations, the United Nations, his lifetime commitment to peace, his work on behalf of war refugees, and his vast knowledge of disarmament, Philip John Noel-Baker was awarded the Nobel Prize for Peace. During his Nobel Prize lecture, he spoke of the threat posed by nuclear weapons and the arms race. He declared that the solution lay, not in partial measures, but in a comprehensive and complete program of disarmament under the United Nations. “Disarmament is … for every nation,” he stated, “the safest and most practicable system of defense.” Noel-Baker retired from the House of Commons at age 80, declaring, “While I have the health and strength, I shall give all my time to the work of breaking the dogmatic sleep of those who allow the nuclear, chemical, biological, and conventional arms race to go on.” In 1977, Philip John Noel-Baker was made a life peer as Baron Noel-Baker of Derby. He died in London on 9 October 1982.

Recovering from a serious war injury, he began competing as an athlete in his late 20s with MAC Budapest. In 1924 Somfay finished second in pentathlon at the Paris Olympics. All his life Somfay believed that he had won the pentathlon in 1924. This was due to the fact that he believed he ran the 200 m in 22.8 seconds, which would have been enough to win. He protested with a written confirmation from one of the timekeepers, but the president of the Hungarian NOC was not interested in investigating the matter, and the protest was denied. According to his last will “Elemér Somfay Olympic Champion” was carved on his tomb. From 1922 to 1930, Somfay won 19 Hungarian champion titles. In 1928 he sustained a serious injury to his Achilles’ tendon, but a year later he was back on track. In 1932, he competed in modern pentathlon at the Los Angeles Olympics.

At that event, Le doubled in the 50 and 100 freestyle, while also anchoring both of the victorious 4 x 100 free and medley relay teams. To crown this achievement, she also bettered the world record in both individual events, marks which both lasted until Inge de Bruijn bettered them in 2000. While the Chinese women’s performances at the Rome worlds were surrounded by rumours and occasional proof of doping (in part to the presence of East German) coaches, Le has never tested positive. Her performances in Rome earned her an accolade from the United Press, winning the International Athlete of the Year award, succeeding compatriot Wang Junxia. In addition to her 1994 World Championships performance, she earned four Olympic medals. Three of these came in Atlanta 1996, including the prestigious 100 metre freestyle title. Le Jingyi also won a host of titles at the World Short-Course Championships. In 1993, she won five titles (50 free, 100 free, 4 x 100 and 4 x 200 m freestyle and the medley relay), setting world records in both individual events that would last until Therese Alshammar broke them in 1999. Le added five more golds, in 1995 and 1997. She retired after failing to qualify for the Sydney Olympics.","Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the Summer Universiade (2–0–0 1993 Buffalo SWI gold: 50 m freestyle and 100 m freestyle) Listed in Olympians Who Set a World Record in Long Course Swimming (50 m freestyle – 11 September 1994 - 4 June 2000: 24.51 (11 September 1994; Roma, ITA); 100 m freestyle – 5 September 1994 - 28 May 2000: 54.01 (5 September 1994; Roma, ITA); 4×100 m freestyle relay – 7 September 1994 - 16 September 2000: 3:37.91 (7 September 1994; Roma, ITA); 4×100 m medley relay – 10 September 1994 - 23 September 2000: 4:01.67 (10 September 1994; Roma, ITA)) Listed in Olympians Who Set a World Record in Short Course Swimming (50 m freestyle – 3 December 1993 - 11 December 1999: 24.62 (3 December 1993; Palma de Mallorca, ESP), 24.23 (3 December 1993; Palma de Mallorca, ESP); 100 m freestyle – 2 December 1993 - 10 December 1999: 53.01 (2 December 1993; Palma de Mallorca, ESP); 4×100 m freestyle relay – 4 December 1993 - 8 April 2006: 3:35.97 (4 December 1993; Palma de Mallorca, ESP), 3:34.55 (19 April 1997; Göteborg, SWE); 4×200 m freestyle relay – 3 December 1993 - 17 April 1997: 7:52.45 (3 December 1993; Palma de Mallorca, ESP); 4×100 m medley relay – 5 December 1993 - 4 April 1999: 3:57.73 (5 December 1993; Palma de Mallorca, ESP)) Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the Pan Pacific Swimming Championships (1–2–0 1997 Fukuoka gold: 50 m freestyle, silver: 100 m freestyle and 200 m freestyle) Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the World Aquatics Championships (4–0–0 1994 Roma SWI gold: 50 m freestyle, 100 m freestyle, 4×100 m freestyle relay, and 4×100 m medley relay) Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the World Short-Course Swimming Championships (25 m) (10–0–2 1993 Palma de Mallorca gold: 50 m freestyle, 100 m freestyle, 4×100 m freestyle relay, 4×200 m freestyle relay, and 4×100 m medley relay; 1995 Rio de Janeiro gold: 50 m freestyle, 100 m freestyle, and 4×100 m freestyle relay; 1997 Göteborg gold: 4×100 m freestyle relay and 4×100 m medley relay, bronze: 50 m freestyle and 100 m freestyle)"

In 1923 Wheatley reached all three finals at the Queen’s Club Covered Court Championships. He beat Ali Hassan Fyzee of India to win the singles in four sets after losing the first set 6-1. He then had to play another five setter in losing the doubles with Hamilton Price, later a Wimbledon referee, and he had to again go the distance in the mixed doubles but was once more runner-up, with Evelyn Colyer who, later in the year would become Wheatley’s fiancée.

Hailing from Edinburgh, wealthy landowner Crabbe was a descendant of Miller Crabbie, founder of the John Crabbie & Son whisky business in the early 1800s. It is alleged that after John Crabbie applied to join the exclusive New Club in Edinburgh around 1900, he was blackballed because he was a tradesman when the club was for “gentlemen” only. Because the name Crabbie was so well known in the area he changed his surname to Crabbe the next day, and thus gained membership. Despite the change, the name Crabbies still exists as one of the best known alcoholic ginger beers in Britain. Very tall, Archie Crabbe was educated at Eton and later served in the Scots Guards, where he was a good all-round sportsman. He rowed for the Guards, played polo for Roehampton and Hurlingham, and was a good standard low-handicap golfer. He also enjoyed hunting and racing fast cars, and in the late 1930s was often seen racing his BMW around the famous Brooklands track. His son Colin also followed him into the guards, and also had the same love of fast cars. In 1969 and 1970, he entered one of the last privately-owned teams in Formula One. The top Swedish driver Ronnie Peterson drove a Colin Crabbe McLaren in 1970. Archie Crabbe also enjoyed flying, having obtained his aviator’s licence in 1934, the same year he was involved in a minor flying accident when, as a passenger, the plane he was travelling in stalled and crashed into a field near Retford, Nottinghamshire. Fortunately, he only received minor injuries. He reached the rank of lieutenant in the Guards and received the OBE in 1945 for his military service in North Europe during World War II.

The game then went into extra time and within seven minutes of the start of the extra period, Britain’s chances were dashed by three quick goals from their European opponents. Robb started his career as a teenager with Finchley as an inside-forward but whilst serving with the Royal Navy he played for their football team and was switched to the wing and it was in that position that he became yet another one of the many fine wingers in England in the 1950s. He first signed amateur terms with Tottenham Hotspur in 1944 but with not being offered a permanent contract he continued with his teaching career at Crouch End primary school. However, he re-signed for Spurs in December 1951 on amateur forms and made his début on Christmas Day that year, scoring one goal in a 3-0 win over Charlton Athletic at The Valley. He was offered a professional contract in the summer of 1953 and went on to play 200 League and Cup games for Tottenham, scoring 58 goals. Having won 17 amateur caps he went on to become one of the few post-war players to win England amateur and full international caps. Sadly, his only senior cap was in the humiliating 6-3 defeat by Hungary at Wembley in November 1953, England’s first defeat on home soil by continental opposition. His penultimate game for Spurs was in the 10-4 win over Everton in October 1958 (Bill Nicholson’s first game in charge of Tottenham). A week later he was in the side that won 4-3 at Leicester City. However, a knee injury sustained in the London 5-a-side tournament meant an end to his career and he eventually called it a day in 1960. Robb continued his teaching career whilst at Spurs, at Christ’s College Finchley, and after he quit the game he took up a post at Ardingley Public School, Sussex, in 1964 where he stayed until his retirement in 1986. In the 1970s he was a member of the Lindfield Cricket Club in Sussex. He died on Christmas Day 2011, on the 60th anniversary of him scoring on his Spurs debut against Charlton.",

Perhaps his most notable tournament, however, was the 1908 Summer Olympics where he won a bronze medal in the Team Pursuit, 1,980 yards alongside Walt Andrews, Fred McCarthy, and Will Anderson. He also competed in four other events at the Games, but never left the opening round of any of them. He continued competing, on and off, through the 1910s, and eventually retired to found and run a bicycle shop in Toronto in the 1920s.

He was overlooked by the selectors for a place at the 2000 Olympics but was instead chosen for the World Championships, which is held only for non-Olympic classes in the year of an Olympic Games, and won his first world title as part of the coxed four. In the re-shuffle of the team following Sydney, Williams was placed in the coxed four and the newly formed crew justified the faith given to them by winning the World Championship at their first attempt in 2001. The four were silver medal winners in 2002 and 2003 but in early 2004 the crew was completely revamped to allow the inclusion of Olympic champions Matthew Pinsent and James Cracknell with only Williams retaining his seat, After a summer blighted by illness and injury the quartet recovered to win Olympic gold in Athens. In 2005 the four was once again overhauled and again it was Williams who was the only member to retain his place in the crew. The change of personnel seemed to have little effect and world titles followed in both 2005 and 2006. The quartet suffered a surprise defeat in the 2007 World Championship but rebounded to retain their Olympic title in Beijing. After taking a year away from the water Williams decided to retire from competition but retained an adventurous spirit.

920883,Renzo Massarani,Male,26 March 1898,,, Italy,ITA,"Italian musician Renzo Massarani, a volunteer in World War I, studied and graduated under Ottorino Respighi and continued to follow his stylistic guidelines. In the early 1920s, he was one of the members of the group “I Tre”. He became musical director of the marionette theater “Teatro dei Piccoli”, for which he wrote some of his most successful works. With the theater, he made numerous tours including one in South America. He also worked as a music critic and was later employed by the Italian Society of Authors and Publishers (SIAE). In 1934, he wrote Squilli e danze per il “18 B.L.” for a mass spectacle commemorating the march on Roma held near Firenze. Closely related to this work was his 1936 entry Squilli e danze atletiche (Rings and athletic dances). A contemporary clipping even seems to indicate that they are actually identical, and perhaps the title was changed to make it more sports related. The decade from 1928-38 was his most prolific period, when he wrote orchestral, chamber and instrumental works. His music was firmly linked to the Italian tradition, especially in piano repertoire and chamber songs. Massarani was of Jewish descent and was banned during the fascist dictatorship of Benito Mussolini, although he had participated in the March on Roma in 1922 and was considered representative of fascist ideology. On one hand, he defended avant-garde composers like Stravinsky after the International Music Festival in Roma; on the other hand, he organized the exhibition of the Fascist Musicians’ Union in 1933. Until 1938, when the race laws were also implemented in Italy, his compositions were heard at all major artistic events, but much of his work was later destroyed. In 1939, Massarani was forced to immigrate to Brazil and was awarded citizenship there in 1945. In Brazil, he mainly worked as an orchestrator and music critic. He then did all he could to insure that his pre-war works would never be played, forbade their reproduction and performance, and made it extremely difficult to find them.",

On a study trip to Rome and Florence, he became acquainted with Italian Renaissance and Baroque painting, which had a strong influence on him. After his studies von Mitschke-Collande worked in Paris with Maurice Denis and Fernand Léger and came into contact with Cubism. He served in World War I and afterwards was one of the founders of the “Dresden Secession Group 1919”. In 1937, some of his paintings were confiscated as “degenerate” and destroyed. During World War II, he worked temporarily as a teacher at the Fashion and Textile School in Berlin. Large parts of his work were destroyed during the bombing of Dresden.

In addition to painting he worked in sculpture, producing a variety of materials and techniques.

Kragh took painting lessons from 1883 before studying at the art academy since 1887. Then he made an apprenticeship as a painter. From 1899 he was also trained as a sculptor and went to Roma in the following year to become a student of Victor Segoffin. Kragh had a great influence on the ecclesiastical art of Denmark, especially in the field of stained glass. His initially realistic and Art Nouveau influenced paintings later showed impressionistic tendencies. As a sculptor, he created naturalistic busts, figurine and animal statuettes, mostly made of bronze and fired clay, but also mosaics.

He was also president of the Oxford University Boat Cub in 1937 and 1938. He was a three-time Blue (1936-38) and in 1937 played a major part in the revival of Oxford’s fortunes when they halted a run of 13 consecutive Cambridge wins, only after being persuaded to stay on another year at University. His future brother-in-law Ronnie Rowe was in the same boat. Cherry also coached the losing 1939 Oxford crew. At Henley, Cherry, who had joined the Leander Club in 1936, was a member of their eights that finished second to the Ruder Club, Zürich in the Grand Challenge Cup that year. He won the 1937 and 1938 Stewards’ Challenge, however, with the Leander coxless fours. He was the Leander captain in 1938 and 1939. At the outbreak of World War II, Cherry took a commission in the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve (RNVR) and served as a lieutenant on the minelayer HMS Welshman. The ship had the role of transporting food and supplies to the island of Malta during the war, and her exploits featured in the 1953 movie Malta Story starring Alec Guinness and Jack Hawkins. Cherry was killed when the Welshman was torpedoed and sunk off the coast of Tobruk. Of all the sporting contests Cherry took part in, perhaps the most unusual was in 1938 when Brasenose College represented England in a Trans-Atlantic spelling bee contest against the United States, represented by Harvard and Radcliffe College. The contest was organised by the BBC, and the USA won by four points.","Listed in Olympians Who Competed in the Boat Race (1936 Oxford (lost), 1937 Oxford (won), 1938 Oxford (won)) Listed in Olympians Who Were Killed or Missing in Action or Died as a Result of War (†1 February 1943.

Nicknamed “Diesel,” he ran both track, primarily the steeplechase, and cross-country. He won six Italian cross-country titles and competed at the International Cross-Country Championships in 1982, 1984, 1987, and 1989, placing sixth in 1982. On the track, Panetta was Italian junior champion in the 2,000 metre steeplechase in 1981 and 1982. He was the top Italian steepler throughout the mid-1980s. In 1986 he took silver in the steeple at the European Championships, while in 1987 he won the European Cup and the World Championships, adding a silver in the 10K at the Worlds. After 1988, Panetta abandoned the steeplechase for the 10,000, placing sixth at the 1993 World Championships, while winning the 1994 European Cup. At the 1994 European Championships, Panetta stopped to help teammate Azzurri Lambruschini, who had fallen on a barrier, and paced him back to the pack. Lambruschini won the race and European gold, while Panetta ended up off the podium; however, his gesture of altruism remained in the memory of Italian sportsmen even more than his medals. From 1982-96 Panetta earned 34 international caps. Subsequent attempts to move up to the marathon were disappointing. In addition to the six national cross-country titles, Panetta won Italian titles over 5,000 in 1988, 10,000 in 1986, and the steeplechase in 1985 and 1988.

Harbig’s record would not be broken for 19 years. In 1938, Harbig won the European Championships over 800 metres, with the non-Olympian Jacques Lévèque (FRA) second and Lanzi third, and took a second gold with the 4×400 metres relay team (with Hermann Blazejezak and the non-Olympians Manfred Bues and Erich Linnhoff). Harbig was first noticed by German sports authorities in 1934 when he won the “Tag des Unbekannten Sportsmannes”, and they then promoted his career. Although he was never interested in politics he reluctantly joined the SA in 1937, and the Nazis exploited his sport career as a model for their propaganda. At the 1936 Olympic Games in Berlin he won the bronze medal with the 4x400 meters relay together with Friedrich von Stülpnagel, Harry Voigt and Helmut Hamann, and was eliminated in the heats over 800 meters. Domestically he was German Champion 1936-42 seven times in a row over 800 meters. He set two more world records over 400 meters in 46.0 in 1939 and with the 4x800 meters relay in 1941. Killed in action in 1944, he became a sports legend in both parts of Germany after World War II. In 1955 his wife, Gerda Heinrich, published “Unvergessener Rudolf Harbig. Ein Lebensbild des Weltrekordläufers” in East Germany and the Dresden stadium was named after him.

Unlike St. Germain and Neville, however, Farquharson was on the Montreal Victorias roster for the 1935-1936 season. At the tournament he played in eight games and was the team’s scoring leader with 11 goals, but the team had to settle for their first silver medal. After the Olympics, he played one season with the Southampton Vikings of the English National League, and then spent five seasons (1937-1942) as coach for the McGill Redmen.

Durham, and the thick black mud at the bottom of it stemmed from its close proximity to the local coalmine. Her father, a former junior rugby international, was a local colliery manager and wanted her daughter to have better coaching in the United States, but it was not part of the ASA agenda so she continued training at Dawdon. But it paid dividends. A student at Durham High School she did not start swimming until the age of 11 but two years later was a Durham and Northumberland ladies champion. Having won swimming and diving trophies she turned her attention to diving and qualified for the 1952 Helsinki Olympics. She was just two months beyond her 15th birthday when she arrived in Finland, the first time she had ever been outside Great Britain, and she defied her years by finishing fifth in the springboard event. Welsh competed in her second Olympics at Melbourne fours years later but finished well down the field in both diving events. However, her moment of glory was to come at the British Empire and Commonwealth Games in Cardiff in 1958. Having placed fourth in the springboard four years earlier, she became a double gold medallist in Cardiff winning both the springboard and platform events. Less than two months later she won the springboard silver medal in the European Championships at Budapest. She was expected to appear in her third Olympics at Rome in 1960 but she surprisingly quit diving in 1959 because she felt there was too much “politics” within the sport Welsh also represented Durham at both fencing and shooting and later became a teacher. Sadly, Welsh was widowed when her husband Peter, along with her only daughter, and fiancé, were killed in a car crash. Well into her 70s Charmian continued to coach young divers in Durham and in 2013 was honoured with a lifetime achievement award by British Swimming for Outstanding Contribution at Club Level. Regarding the spelling of her very rare forename, she said in 2008: “I’ve only come across five or six people in my life who’ve shared it. Cleopatra had a handmaiden called Charmian.

69202,Ken Jones,Male,30 December 1921,180.0,75, Great Britain,GBR,"Kenneth Jeffrey Jones, a native of Blaenavon in southern Wales, was an Olympic champion in track and field for three days, but will be best remembered for his achievements in rugby. Jones’s athletic talents first became apparent during his service with the RAF in India during World War II. In 1945, he won the 100y sprint at the All-India Games, and won the Welsh title in the 100 and 220y. In 1946 he joined the Newport rugby side, where he would play until his farewell from sports in 1958. The same season, he was selected for the Welsh national team to play England in the first match of the 1947 Five Nations Tournament. As the anchorman of the British 4×100 m relay team at the 1948 Olympics in London, Jones finished second behind the US. However, the jury disqualified the American team because of an irregular exchange, and the British team was awarded the gold medal. Three days later, after examining film material of the race, the disqualification was overturned, and the Americans were reinstated as Olympic champions. Another runner on the UK relay team, Jack Gregory, was also a rugby international. He played his only cap (for England) against Wales, which had Jones in their line-up. Jones played 44 international matches for Wales (of which 43 consecutive), a world record that stood for 20 years. The wingman scored a total of 17 tries, and captained his team once. In his active years, Wales won the Five Nations 6 times, twice by winning all four matches (Grand Slam). Jones also played for the British Lions in their 1950 tour of New Zealand and Australia. His best remembered feat, however, is the game-winning try he scored in the 1953 game between Wales and New Zealand at Cardiff, marking the last time the Welsh rugbyers defeated the All-Blacks. His record in track running features a multitude of Welsh titles, winning the sprint double 7 times, while scoring a triple by adding the long jump in 1949. Besides the 1948 Olympics, he took part in two major championships, both in 1954 (his last year in athletics). At the European Championships in Bern, he won a silver medal with the British 4×100 m relay team (with Ken Box, Brian Shenton, and the non-Olympian George Ellis), and at the 1954 British Empire and Commonwealth Games in Vancouver, he won a bronze in the 220 yards and finished six in the 100 yards. He was named the first Welsh Sportsman of the Year in 1955, and awarded the OBE in 1960. When the 1958 British Empire and Commonwealth Games were held in Cardiff, Jones was asked to be the final runner to carry the baton with a message from the Queen during the opening ceremony, an honour comparable with being the final torchbearer in the opening ceremony of the Olympics. In 1990, he was one of the first ten inductees in the Welsh Sports Hall of Fame. A high school teacher for most of his life, Jones also worked as a rugby reporter for more than two decades, and served on the board of the Newport rugby club. He resigned as the president of the club in 1995, in protest of the introduction of professionalism in the sport. After a stroke, he was confined to a wheelchair for the final years of his life.

In shooting World Championships, Moreaux also fared well. Not counting the two medals at the Paris Games (which doubled as World Championships), he won 18 medals, including two world titles. These both came in 1898, when he won he team free rifle event with France, and the free rifle prone competition. At the same tournament, he also came second in the free rifle overall and standing competitions, and came third in the kneeling ranking. Curiously, Moreaux has also won seven bronze medals in the team free pistol event (1902, 1904-1909). His last World Championship medal came in 1911, when he ranked third in the army rifle prone competition.

First serving on board HMS Gambia, Fletcher was diverted to the Levant (later Anglo-Hellenic) Schooner Flotilla, whose aims were intelligence gathering, striking at enemy island garrisons in the Aegean, and disrupting their communications. At the end of the war, he was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross, and promoted to lieutenant, commanding a trawler engaged in clearing mines from the English Channel. After the war, Fletcher went to Trinity College, Oxford to read Classics, later diverting to Modern Greek with the benefit of his war-time experience. He captained the Oxford hockey team and was selected to the British 1952 Olympic team, winning a bronze medal. In all, Fletcher was capped 22 times with the England team between 1949-55. He managed the 1964 British Olympic hockey team and from 1973-83 was president of the British Hockey Association. Fletcher’s graduation coincided with the establishment of a new lectureship at Oxford in Modern Greek, which he won in competition. Trinity elected him first to a Fellowship and shortly after became its Domestic Bursar. In 1967-68, Fletcher was the Senior Proctor and led the University’s governing body, the Hebdomadal Council. At the same time, Fletcher was also a member of Hart Committee, which paved the way to the reform of the relationship between the student body and the Oxford authorities. Later his interest in academic administration led to service on the Trustee Boards for a number of leading public schools.

Together, Dobrzyńska and Łoboda designed numerous public buildings, especially hospitals, but also residential buildings. In 1927 both participated in the tender for the business place of the League of Nations in Geneva. Dobrzyńska died at Warsaw in 1940. Dobrzyńska and Łoboda initially won the tender for the new Central Institute for Physical Education in Warsaw-Bielany, but Edgar Norwerth’s design was eventually preferred. The Stadium in Warsaw (Szczęśliwice) was also not implemented. Its design won the third prize in the tender. Originally scheduled as an Olympic stadium, it was to be built in the old fortress Szczęśliwice. The stadium would have offered 13,000 seats and standing room for 27,000, and incorporated in the plans was a train stop.

921284,Max d'Ollone,Male,13 June 1875,,, France,FRA,"Max d’Ollone was a prolific French composer who composed 11 operas and one ballet, but also chamber and orchestral music. Later he became the director of music at Angers, professor at the Paris Conservatoire and director of the Opéra Comique and held many other official positions. D’Ollone started to write music and attracted the interest of established composers at an early age. At the Paris Conservatoire his teachers were French composers Lavignac, Massenet, Gédalge and Lenepveu. In his early 20s, he was awarded the Grand Prix de Roma. During his subsequent stay in Roma he won the Rossini competition with his lyric poem Dante’s Vision. He continued to write orchestral music but always preferred music for the theater. D’Ollone even wrote the libretto for his opera Le Retour, praised by critics but less successful with the public. His masterpiece is considered to be the 1920 opera L’Arlequin. During the German occupation in World War II, d’Ollone collaborated with the Germans and the French Vichy regime. He organized concerts with loyal musicians and held positions in institutions implemented by the Germans. After the liberation, he was imprisoned for a short period but soon released and his case was not pursued further, not the least because he was exculpated by artists from the French resistance movement. D’Ollone had a conservative understanding of music. In several publications, he argued against new developments like the Viennese Schönberg-School and 12-tone technique. He had an early connection to the Olympics: His speech about “Le sport et la beauté plastique” was held at the 1906 Consultative Conference for the Arts, Literature and Sports and published in the “Revue Olympique”. The title of his submitted composition is unknown; in the year 1912 he composed, inter alia, Elevation (for orchestra and singing voice).",

Pedersen set several Danish records in athletics and represented his country at two Olympic Games. Pedersen’s athletics career began in 1904 and he went on to win multiple races in both Denmark and Germany. In 1909 he became a sporting hero in the city of Kolding when he became the Danish champion in the five-mile race. Pedersen became a racewalking specialist, competing in various distances at the Olympics either side of World War I. At the 1912 Stockholm Olympics he took part in the 10km walk, but was disqualified in his heat. History repeated itself at the 1920 Antwerpen Olympics when Pedersen was once again disqualified in the heats of the 10km walk. He had better success in the 3,000m walk after qualifying from his heat to finish in 11th place in the final. After moving from his place of birth in Brenderup to the city of Kolding, Pedersen trained as a plumber, becoming a master plumber in 1922. The city’s coat of arms, located at the entrance of the town hall in Kolding, were designed by architect Ernst Petersen and produced by Pedersen. In 1939 a sculpture named “The Bull”, which Pedersen made, was erected on the harbour. Pedersen had a pro-German stance during World War II. After the war had ended, he was arrested and spent two years in the Kolding Arrest prison. A special court convicted him of numerous offences including protection fraud, but he was later acquitted.

920660,Richard Konwiarz,Male,15 February 1883,,, Germany,GER,"Richard Konwiarz attended the Dresden Art Academy. He was chief building officer and town planner in the German town of Breslau (later Wrocław, Poland), especially responsible for sporting venues. After World War II he was briefly director of the town planning department in Dresden, before he left the GDR after his retirement and moved to Hanover. There he developed the concept of a training facility network, which included the Niedersachsenstadion (today HDI Arena), that he designed and presented in the 1952 Olympic art exhibition. n 1954, together with German sports leader Carl Diem, Konwiarz was one of the fathers of the Golden Plan, on behalf of the German Olympic Society (DOG), which helps towns and communities to identify the need for sports facilities to this day, despite multiple revisions to the plan. Diem planned to affiliate an institution providing sports facilities to the Sport University in Köln (Cologne), which was to be headed by Konwiarz. However, the project was finished only after Diem’s death. On the occasion of his 75th birthday, Konwiarz received the Silver Plaque of Honor of the DOG. In 1932, he won the bronze medal at the Los Angeles Art Competitions in the category Architecture, Architectural Designs, for his work Plan of Silesian Arena with which he had already taken part in the 1928 Art Competitions. The stadium, with an initial capacity of 35,000 seats, was built from 1926-28 and enlarged from 1935 to 1939. The name was changed from Silesian Arena to Hermann-Göring-Stadium in 1933 and to Olympic Stadium after World War II. The Polish name of the stadium was derived from the Olympic Bronze Medal, which was awarded to Konwiarz in 1932. Today, the stadium is only used for Speedway races. Plans of an expansion for the UEFA Championship 2012 did not materialize. Konwiarz already participated with this project in the 1928 art competition, but without success. In 1932, additional buildings and facilities of the sports park “Leerbeutel”, of which the Silesian Race Course was the center, were presented. Of these, the “Public park and outdoor pool” in the northwestern part of the complex could be identified. The buildings of the bathhouse were partly rebuilt but essentially still preserved in the original design. The Stadium in Lower Saxony, his 1952 entry, opened in 1954 as Niedersachsenstadion. It was originally designed for 86,656 spectators and was rebuilt and renamed several times over the years. The costs at that time amounted to 4,000,000 DM. Konwiarz planned the project together with architects Heinz Goesmann (1920-2010) and Rudolf Hillebrecht (1910-99), the city’s building officer. For the construction (1952-54), rubble was also used for a huge embankment to which the west grandstand was attached. The structure itself was partially founded on concrete piles.",

921596,John Russell Pope,Male,24 April 1874,,, United States,USA,"Architect John Russell Pope was a representative of historicism. His designs were based on neo-Gothic and Tudor style, but especially on neo-classicism. The son of a well-known portrait painter, Pope studied architecture at Columbia University and, after graduating in 1894, at the American Academy in Roma and the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris. In 1900 he returned to the United States and after a short time started his own business. Initially, he planned private mansions, notably for the Vanderbilt family, but he soon was also given larger projects. Pope designed the West Wing of the National Gallery of Art in Washington and the famous Jefferson Memorial, which was only finished after his death in 1937, works clearly based on the Roman Pantheon. As one of the last representatives of historicism, however, he was harshly criticized by the modern stylists. In 1932, Pope won the silver medal at the Los Angeles Olympics in the Art Competitions in the category Architecture, Architectural Designs, for his work Design for the Payne Whitney Gymnasium in New Haven. He submitted 31 drawings and photographs of the gymnasium built in 1932 in the Neo-Gothic style. A list of these objects is given below.

He was a defender who played 24 seasons in the German Bundesliga (later German Ice Hockey League DEL) in 1,020 matches, scoring 881 points. With the Kölner EC “Die Haie” (Cologne Sharks) he won six German Championships, in 1977, 1979, 1984, 1986, 1987 and 1988, and was elected Player of the Year in 1977, 1984, and 1986.

After the 1987 World Championship he was named to the World Championship All-Star Team. Kießling retired after a severe injury in 1997.

69091,Tommy Green,Male,30 March 1894,,, Great Britain,GBR,"Olympic history contains many stories of handicaps that champions have overcome but few can match the adversities Tommy Green faced before being crowned champion in one of the most grueling events of the Olympic program. Because of rickets, he was unable to walk at all until he was five years old; in 1906 he falsified his age in order to join the Army but was invalided out of the Royal Hussars four years later as a result of injuries received when a horse fell on him. Then after being recalled with the Reserve in 1914, he was wounded three times and badly gassed while serving with the King’s Own Hussars in France. Green was first encouraged to take up walking by a war-blinded friend whom he had been helping to train for the St. Dunstan’s London-to-Brighton walk and in 1926, at the age of 32, Green won the first race he entered, a 12 mile race from Worthing-to-Brighton. Following this surprise victory he joined Belgrave Harriers and built up an impressive record in all the major road races. Green won the London-to-Brighton four times and was a six-time winner of both the Manchester to Blackpool and the Nottingham to Birmingham races. Other major successes included a win in the classic Milan 100 km. in 1930, a year which also saw him win the inaugural British 50 km. title. The only significant event that Green never managed to win was the National 20 miles championship, although he finished second on five occasions. Undoubtedly, the greatest of Tommy Green’s many triumphs was his victory in the 50 km. walk at the Los Angeles Olympics in 1932. After being troubled by the strong Californian sun he was at one stage one minute behind the leaders, but walking magnificently in the closing stages, he came through to win by more than seven minutes. At the age of 38 years and 126 days, Green is the oldest-ever winner of the event. In 1936 he made a great bid to make the Olympic team for a second time, but his fourth place in the RWA 50 km. was not quite good enough to earn him selection for the Berlin Games. After his checkered early life, Tommy Green held a variety of jobs before being employed at the Eastleigh Railway Works, where he demonstrated that accident-proneness is a continuing condition by losing a thumb in an industrial accident. On retiring from the railways, Green became a publican in Eastleigh and was a prominent figure in the local sporting world. Personal Bests: 20kmW – 1-38:45.3 (1933); 50kmW – 4-35:36.0 (1930).",

Tibor, however, was destined to succeed on a different stage. Due to spinal problems as a child, Benedek started swimming, but soon switched to water polo. He won successive junior championships and, as a teenager, played in the junior national team, and in 1989, became Junior European Champion. In 1990, when just 18-years-old, he made his senior international début and won the bronze medal at the World Championships the following year. At the age of 20, Benedek participated in the Barcelona Olympics and became the tournament’s top scorer with 22 goals. With his club side, Újpest, Benedek won four national championship titles, the LEN Cup in 1993, and the Champions League a year later. In 1993 and 1995, he won silver medals with the national team at the European Championships. Although the Hungarian team missed a medal at the Atlanta Olympics, Benedek was again the tournament’s top scorer. After the Games, he moved to Italy and spent five years with AS Roma and a further three years with Pro Recco. During this first period in Italy, he collected two more championship titles (one with each team) and one national cup victory. At this time, the Hungarian national team started to enjoy a great deal of success and won the 1997 and 1999 European Championships. Benedek won a World Championship silver medal in 1998, followed by gold at the 2000 Olympics in Sydney, when Hungary became Olympic champions for the first time in 24 years. Benedek scored four goals in the final against Russia. In 2002 and 2003 Hungary won both the World League and the World Championships and, in 2004, they defended their Olympic title at Athens. After the Olympics, Benedek moved back to Hungary and joined Honvéd, led by his former Újpest coach, István Kovács. In three years, he added two more Hungarian titles, taking his total to six. After being diagnosed with a heart rhythm disorder, he temporarily stopped playing before a return in 2007, when he added a World Cup silver medal to his collection. In 2007, Benedek moved to Italy for a second spell, and re-joined Pro Recco. He went on to win four more Italian championships, and a Champions League title, within five years. He also became an Olympic champion for a third time in 2008, when Hungary won in Beijing. After the Olympics Benedek retired from the national team and started to work as an assistant coach with the Hungarian national team. In 2012, at the age of almost 40, he ended his playing career, and six months later, in January 2013, Benedek was appointed head coach of the national team. As a coach, Benedek’s greatest success was in guiding Hungary to victory at the 2013 World Championships, as he became a dual world champion as player and coach. In the following years he won one silver and one bronze medal at the European Championships. After finishing fifth at the Rio Olympics, he left his coaching position in October 2016 and joined the presidency of the Hungarian Water Polo Association. In January 2017, Benedek became the sport director of Újpest, and later their head coach, which turned out to be his final act in an exceptional career.",Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the European Water Polo Championships (1–2–3 1993 Sheffield silver; 1995 Wien silver; 1997 Sevilla gold; 2001 Budapest bronze; 2003 Kranj bronze; 2008 Malaga bronze) Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the World Aquatics Championships (1–2–1 1991 Perth WAP bronze; 1998 Perth WAP silver; 2003 Barcelona WAP gold; 2007 Melbourne WAP silver)

At Cambridge he went on to became a record five-time Blue between 1952-55 and captained the team in his final year. He was also the secretary of the Cambridge University Football Club. While training to be a solicitor Mike played football for Boston United, Pegasus and several Football League teams who called on him when they had a goalkeeping crisis. He had several offers to turn professional at an early stage of his career but as he later said: “The maximum wage for a footballer in the early fifties was £12 a week - there was no maximum in the legal profession”. He won the first of his 52 England amateur caps against Wales in 1954 and was the number one choice for the 1956 Olympics. He traveled to Melbourne but injured his wrist shortly before the opening game and did not take any further part. He toured Nigeria and Ghana with the FA XI in 1958 and two years later in Rome he got to make his Olympic début when he played in all three Great Britain group matches including the 2-2 draw with Italy who included players like Giovanni Trapattoni, manager of the Republic of Ireland national team 2008-13, and Gianni Rivera, both from the Italian under-21 squad. A London solicitor, he played four games for Manchester United in 1961 when regular goalkeeper Harry Gregg was injured. Pinner was playing for Queens Park Rangers and also doing National Service in the RAF at the time. Later that year he got a similar call from Chelsea to stand in when Peter Bonetti was injured. Pinner was the last amateur to play in the top flight of English football. Having played two games in the qualifying tournament for the 1964 Olympics he turned semi-professional with Leyton Orient at the age of 29 in 1963 and consequently never went to his third Olympics. He played 113 League games for seven clubs and ended his career at Belfast Distillery nearly 20 years after making his début as a 14-year-old.","Listed in Olympians Who Participated in the 1956 Olympic Football Qualification Campaign (2 App. - 0 goals - 180 min. played: BUL 0:2 (a), BUL 3:3 (h)) Listed in Olympians Who Participated in the 1960 Olympic Football Qualification Campaign (4 App. - 0 goals - 360 min. played: IRL 3:2 (h), IRL 3:1 (a), NED 5:1 (a), NED 2:2 (h)) Listed in Olympians Who Participated in the 1964 Olympic Football Qualification Campaign (2 App. - 0 goals - 180 min. played: ISL 6:0 (a), ISL 4:0 (h))"

In 1924 he passed his master’s exam as a goldsmith. He then went to teach artistic metal design at the United State Schools for Applied Arts in Berlin-Charlottenburg. In the 1920s he made a long necklace of coral and porcelain, worn by the actress Brigitte Helm in Fritz Lang’s silent movie classic “Metropolis”. During the Third Reich, Zeitner also created jewelry for Nazi celebrities and was appointed associate professor in 1935. In 1939 he became head of a master studio for goldsmiths at the Prussian Academy of Arts in Berlin. After 1945, he distanced himself from National Socialism; however, he had clearly benefited from commissions from the regime. After the end of World War II, Zeitner went to Lüneburg and initially lived and worked on a houseboat. From 1954 to 1959 he ran a workshop in the “Altes Kaufhaus” (Old Department Store). In the 1960s he created, among other things, the chain of office of the mayor of Lüneburg. Zeitner designed silverware, jewelry and works for public clients. He was also awarded the Lower Saxony and Bavarian State Prizes for his work. While his early works are influenced by Art Nouveau, Art Deco and Bauhaus, his late work shows a development towards abstraction. In 2010, two exhibitions honored his life’s work. His Lauf (Run), exhibited in 1952, is sometimes referred to as a “sports gift of honor (Olympic medal)”. It was a box made of walnut wood, turned by the Lüneburg master turner Rothardt. In the lid there is a silver plaque with a relief figure of a runner with an olive branch and the five rings.",

78915,Steve Prefontaine,Male,25 January 1951,175.0,63, United States,USA,"Steve Prefontaine is likely the most legendary American distance runner, not just for his feats on the track, but his manner of winning, and his early, tragic death. He came to the fore as a high school distance runner in Coos Bay, Oregon, where he broke the 2-mile high school record with 8:41.5. Pre then went to the University of Oregon where he won the NCAA 3-miles/5K all four years of his college career (1970-73), the first athlete to win a track title four years consecutively at the NCAAs. He was also NCAA cross-country champion in 1971-73, failing to win only in his freshman year. Pre won the AAU 3-miles in 1971 and 1973, and was Pan Am champion in 1971 over 5K. Pre was considered a very cocky runner, but he usually lived up to his boasts. Disdaining runners who sat and kicked, he usually set very fast paces, trying to burn off the sprinters. Before the 1972 Olympic 5K, he boasted that he wanted “to go out at world record pace, and then pick it up with a mile to go”. He did not do this, unfortunately, but sat on a slow pace for 2 miles. However, Pre then made that legendary race when he started a long sustained increase of the pace that allowed the field to run the final 1,600 metres at 4-minute pace, but he was outkicked in the final straight to lose a medal. Pre also boasted that he liked to go out fast enough to “put crap into [the other runner’s] legs”. Idolized by fans in his native Oregon, they often wore tee-shirts proclaiming, “Go Pre”. At the 1972 Olympic Trials, some of his competitors wore “Stop Pre” tee-shirts while warming up. After the 1972 Olympics, Pre started running more distances than simply 5K/3-miles. He was considered to be a contender for the 1976 Olympic gold at either 5K or 10K, but never made it to Montréal. After a meet in Eugene, Oregon in late May 1975, he attended a party after which he crashed his car while heading home. Trapped beneath the car, he was crushed and died before the car was discovered. A large rock near the site of his death has become a memorial, called Pre’s Rock.

Landvoigt was born in Washington, DC, to William H. Landvoigt, a high-ranking civil servant in Washington. Arnold Landvoigt worked initially for a printing company in Franklin, but later moved to Washington and became chief of police in Washington, DC.

In 2001 his native town opened a museum devoted solely to his work. The attribution of Dill’s known paintings is not clear.

Shortly after the final, Carpenter made his Great Britain début, in the match against Switzerland at Zürich. The following year he won the ABA title and also selected for the London Olympics. Regarded as one of the British favourites to win a medal, the Peckham hairbrush manufacturer had lost just six of his previous 40 bouts going into the Olympics. Sadly, the boxing competition was marred by some bad judging and several officials were expelled from the Games. Carpenter fell foul of such judging when he lost the points decision in his bout to Belgium’s Alex Bollaert. The Briton clearly outfought his opponent, and brought him to a standstill in the final round. Being the true sportsman that he was, Carpenter accepted the decision and simply said: “I thought I had won.” A stylish boxer, Carpenter turned professional after the Olympics and made his début on 9 November 1948. He won 45 of his 49 professional bouts. He never fought for a Championship Belt and had his last fight at Earl’s Court in October 1953, losing on points to Welshman Dai Dower, who later became the British and European flyweight champion.",

She lived her entire life in her parents’ house at Bushey Park near Enniskerry as an eccentric, was sometimes impoverished, and lived very modestly among all sorts of antiques. In her youth, Boyle learned to play violin and cello and later studied composition. The first public performance of one of her works was in 1920 by amateurs. In the following years, she received the Carnegie Award and a number of her pieces were published and performed in London, where she finished her studies. During her visits to London, she attended concerts and frequented book stores, developing a love for poetry. Although she became a recognized composer, she had frequent problems getting her music published and performed. She wrote choral works, song cycles, a string quartet, concerts for orchestra and three ballets. For the ballets, she also designed the stage design and the costumes. Her last major work was an opera called “Maudlin of Paplewick”. Her lyrics were influenced by Gaelic and medieval poems and contemporary English poetry. When she lived alone in the last years of her life under poor conditions and almost starving, she had visions and mystical experiences. Boyle died of cancer just having finished her opera. Her Lament for Bion was inspired by the poem of the same title, which was falsely attributed to the Greek poet Moschus from approximately 150 BC. Bion of Smyrna (around 100 BC) was a late Hellenistic bucolic poet. The work for tenor solo and string quartet or string orchestra was written in 1945, but only premiered in Galway on March 16, 2022. The manuscript score and the ‘Honourable Mention’ diploma are preserved in the Manuscripts and Archives Research Library, Trinity College, Dublin.",

In the final of ABA Championships that year, he lost to Henry Carpenter. Both Carpenter and Keenan were selected for the London Olympics, but Keenan was a non-starter. He then turned professional and made his début against Al Hutt at Glasgow’s Kelvin Hall on 17 September 1948. Keenan went on to win 54 of his 66 professional bouts, 23 by knockouts. In his 11-year career, he won the British, Commonwealth and European bantamweight titles, and was one of a handful of men to win two Lonsdale Belts outright. At the time of his death, he was the only Scot to do so. Keenan had only one world title fight, losing on points to Vic Toweel in Johannesburg in 1952. It was Keenan’s first defeat in 33 bouts. Many regard Keenan as the best British boxer never to win a world title. After losing his British and Commonwealth bantamweight titles to Freddie Gilroy in 1959, Keenan immediately announced his retirement in the ring in front of 15,000 fans, who spontaneously sang Auld Lang Syne.

He was mainly known as an architect in the large Italian cities of Milano, Napoli and Roma. He was considered as one of those who evolved from the Art Nouveau style in the direction of Nationalism. During this period, he was responsible for the restoration of the historic center of Bologna, the building of the new hospital in Milano, and the design of the stadium of Bologna. In the 1930s he was noticed less and less, as he was considered one of the architects of the older generation and then became a writer and professor in Parma. Arata designed the “Multisport Stadium” of Bologna, originally called “Stadio Littoriale”. Much of the planning is attributed to engineer Umberto Costanzini. The stadium was built from 1925-27 as a combined football and athletics stadium. In addition, there were also two swimming pools, an open 50 m pool and an indoor pool, as well as tennis courts. On the day of the opening by Mussolini, an assassination attempt on the Duce was unsuccessful. In 1929, the Marathon Tower was added as well as an equestrian statue of Mussolini. In 1990, the stadium was converted into a football stadium for the World Cup. In the catalog of the Olympic art exhibition, 1933 is given as the date of completion of the submitted contribution. However, further major stadium projects by Arata are not known.",
69468,Angus Scott,Male,16 August 1927,183.0,70, Great Britain,GBR,"Sheffield-born Angus Scott was the son of one of the Government’s Inspector of Mines. Educated at Sedbergh public school before going up to St. John’s College, Cambridge, Angus went on to become a double rugby and athletics Blue. On the track, Scott was originally a quarter- and half-miler, but switched to hurdling. In 1949, he ran a memorable last leg in the 4x440 yards relay and pipped international sprinter John Wilkinson to clinch the race and that year’s inter-varsity relay match 4-3. Scott was appointed president of the Cambridge University Athletic Club in 1949 and he made the decision to take time out from rugby to concentrate on his own, and his team-mates’, athletics form. In the 1950 AAA 440 yards hurdles, Scott ran second to the multi-winner Harry Whittle and that same year Scott was a member of the winning 4x400 metres relay squad, along with Martin Pike, Les Lewis, and Derek Pugh, at the Bruxelles European Championships. Scott also reached the semi-final of the individual 400 hurdles. Scott was runner up again to Whittle at the AAA championships in 1951 and 1952 and in the latter year went to the Helsinki Olympics and reached the quarter-final of the hurdles. Scott was scheduled to be part of the England team for the 1954 British and Empire Commonwealth Games at Vancouver but withdrew because he was worried about the possible recurrence of an old Achilles tendon injury. His place was taken by Peter Higgins in what was the gold medal-winning relay team. As a rugby player, Scott was a running three-quarter and won his Blue in 1945, with a second one in 1948. That year, Scott played one of his most memorable matches for Cambridge, at the Cardiff Arms Park, when he scored a famous winning try for the University in beating the seemingly invincible Cardiff XV 8-6.

She did not begin to compete, however, until she was a student at Carleton University in the 1960s, but quickly grew in skill and won her first of six consecutive Canadian pistol championships in 1970. She also participated in that year’s World Championships, placing sixth and ninth in the air and match pistol events respectively, and later took part in the 1974 edition. In 1975, the year of her final national championship, she graduated from a Le Cordon Bleu school in Paris, retired from active competition, and began running a cooking school. Upon hearing that women’s pistol shooting was to become an Olympic sport, however, she resumed training and regained her Canadian title in 1982, appearing in another edition of the World Championships later that year. She defended her national crown in 1983 and took her talents to that year’s Pan American Games, where she won silver in the 25 metre pistol and bronze in the 10 metre air pistol. She then achieved her goal of attending the 1984 Summer Olympics, where she won the 25 m pistol event, earning a number of distinctions. Aside from becoming the first woman to win an Olympic shooting event (hers was the first ever women’s shooting event at the Games), she was the first Canadian Olympic gold medalist since 1968, the first individual gold medalist since 1956, and the first female Canadian summer gold medalist since 1928. She was awarded the Velma Springstead Trophy as Canada’s top female athlete of 1984 and made a member of the Order of Canada in 1985, the same year that she won her final national championship. Citing neck and shoulder injuries, she retired in 1987 and returned to her cooking business, later becoming involved in real estate and, on occasion, coaching. In 1995 she attempted to run as a Conservative for a seat in Ontario’s Parliament, but was defeated by Dalton McGuinty, who later became Premier of the province.

89401,Walter Langer,Male,23 August 1899,,, Czechoslovakia,TCH,"Walter Langer was born in Přívoz, Ostrava, one of three sons of Franz Langer and Berta Messing. His family had a long history in the railroad industry; his father worked as a railway clerk and an office dispatcher at the station in Přívoz, one of his grandfathers was a train driver, and the other was a railway supervisor. His paternal family was originally from Bravantice, and his maternal family from Šunychl. Walter Langer attended primary and secondary schooling in Ostrava and later studied chemistry in Wien (Vienna) where he obtained a doctorate degree. While living in Vienna, he was also briefly married and had a daughter, though the marriage was later dissolved. By 1926, Langer first came to the United States and settled in New York where he took up figure skating, training under Austrian figure skater Willy Böckl, four-time World Champion and two-time Olympic silver medallist. He also worked as a chemist in the cosmetics industry for Marinello. A member of the Winter Sports Club and Skating Club of New York, Langer competed in domestic competitions including at the 1928 U.S. Championship in New Haven, Connecticut where he placed third. Over the next few years, he continued to perform in skating carnivals and exhibitions in New York as well as in Czechoslovakia. He also had business interests in Breslau (now Wrocław) as well as in Havana, Cuba. A resident of Brooklyn at the time, Langer represented his birth country of Czechoslovakia at the 1932 Olympic Winter Games held in Lake Placid, New York and placed 10th in men’s singles. During the Olympics, he also reported back to Europe on the events for the Ostrauer Zeitung. Langer retired from competition shortly after the Games, but continued to be active in the sport as an accredited judge. Becoming an American citizen in 1932, Langer established himself in New York City as a leading expert in cosmetics and also worked as a consultant chemist for the American Metals Company (AMCO). Marrying an Englishwoman, the former Eveline Westall Castle in 1936, Langer and his wife went on to run a successful perfume company, Evyan Perfumes in 1946, which became known for its signature scent, White Shadows. By the late 1940s, he and his wife had begun using the names Baron and Baroness von Langendorff and were prominent figures in the social scene of New York City. It does not appear, however, that Langer was from a noble family. Langer and his wife owned several properties in New York City, including the Stuysevant Fish House on Gramercy Park, a suite at the The Pierre Hotel, and two mansions in Westport, Connecticut. Following the death of his Eveline in 1968, he remarried Gabriele Lagerwall, originally from Sweden, who also became known as Baroness Langer von Langendorff. Walter Langer died in his suite at The Pierre in New York City in 1983 at the age of 84 and was interred in a prominent mausoleum at Willowbrook Cemetery in Westport.",

After the Olympics Lane traded his long-held affiliation with the Balmy Beach Canoe Club in Toronto to Ottawa’s Rideau Canoe Club and won the national championship in 1950. At the trials for the 1952 Summer Olympics, he was again selected to compete in the C1-10,000, in which he finished fifth in a field of ten competitors. By then he had earned his Ph.D. in mathematics from the University of Toronto, but he continued to paddle until the end of the decade, eventually moving back to the Toronto area and returning to Balmy Beach.

She was taking no chances of being deported so she, and all the McDonnells who came after her, accepted the name McDonald. Inspired by the feats of his countrymen John Flanagan, Matt McGrath, and Martin Sheridan, Pat McDonald initially had aspirations of becoming a hammer thrower, but he showed more aptitude as a shot putter After placing second to Ralph Rose at the AAU in 1909 and 1910, he took the title in Rose’s absence in 1911 and defeated Rose at the 1912 championships as well as the 1912 Olympics. McDonald won both the shot and the 56-lb. weight event at the AAU championships in 1914, 1919, and 1920 and competed at both events at the Antwerp Olympics. He won the weight throw and placed fourth in the shot. McDonald’s career was remarkable for its longevity. When he won his Olympic gold medal in 1920, he was aged 42, making him the oldest Olympic track & field champion ever. He is also the oldest AAU champion ever – he won the last of an amazing 16 titles in the 56-lb. weight throw in 1933, at 55 years old. McDonald spent most of his adult life in the United States as a member of the New York Police Department, working with the Traffic Squad. Personal Best: SP – 50-4½ (15.34) (1912).",

Hodge was taken to Melbourne as the Greco representative but was moved back to freestyle when Smith was declared ineligible because he had briefly been a coach, which was then against the rules of amateur status. At the Olympics, Hodge lost the gold medal when he was pinned by Bulgaria’s Nikola Stanchev with only two seconds left in the match. In 1958, Hodge embarked on a career in a new sport – boxing. He had 17 amateur bouts, culminating with a victory in the 1959 National Golden Gloves Heavyweight division. He turned professional and had nine fights as a heavyweight, winning seven before retiring in 1961.
