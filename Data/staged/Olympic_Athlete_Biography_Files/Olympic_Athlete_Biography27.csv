In each of her Olympic victories in Antwerp, she set a new world record; had there been a backstroke event on the program she almost certainly would have won a fourth gold medal because she was a world record holder in the backstroke at the time. Bleibtrey had a brief career as an amateur before turning pro in 1922, but between 1920 and 1922 she was undefeated and won an AAU title at every distance from 50y to the long distance event. She was often in the news for incidents related to swimming and in 1919 only public opinion prevented her from being jailed for swimming “nude.” She had merely removed her stockings before going for a swim at Manhattan Beach, but in 1919 this was considered “nudity.” In 1928 she did spend a night in jail after swimming in the Central Park Reservoir, but Mayor Jimmy Walker quickly intervened and New York got its first large swimming pool, which was the original object of the publicity stunt. Bleibtrey had a successful career as a pro swimmer, then became a well-known coach in New York and Atlantic City, and later was a nurse in Palm Beach.","Listed in Olympians Who Set a World Record in Long Course Swimming (100 m freestyle – 23 August 1920 - 30 June 1923: 1:14.4 (23 August 1920; Antwerpen, BEL), 1:13.6 (25 August 1920; Antwerpen, BEL); 400 m freestyle – 16 August 1919 - 29 July 1921: 6:30.2 (16 August 1919; New York City, USA); 4×100 m freestyle relay – 29 August 1920 - 20 July 1924: 5:11.6 (29 August 1920; Antwerpen, BEL))"

He assisted in the design of the Exhibition of the Fascist Revolution and was active in aeropainting. Prampolini pursued a program of abstract and quasi-abstract painting, combined with a career in stage design, after studying at the Academy of Fine Arts in Roma. There, he came into conflict with his teachers because of his Futurist views. Prampolini also spent several years in Paris and had close contacts with the representatives of the European avant-garde art, and with the Section d’Or, Dadaism, the Bauhaus, De Stijl, the Abstraction-Création group, with Pablo Picasso, Piet Mondrian, Wassily Kandinsky, and Jean Cocteau. The film Thaïs, shot in 1918 under Antonio Giulio Bragaglia, with Prampolini’s stage sets, is considered the only surviving futuristic film. Prampolini occupied a place of his own in European abstract art, characterized by his deep concern for dynamism and organicism, which manifested himself in the cosmic visions and dreams of the 1930s and 1940s. In 1927 he founded the Futurist Theatre Prampolini. One year later he conceived the Futurist Pavilion at the Esposizione del Valentino in Turin. After the futurist experiences, he produced different materials and works, sometimes influenced by the visions of the microcosm. After World War II, he devoted himself to informal painting. The painting Angeli della terra from 1936 is listed with different subtitles like Giocatori di Calcio (Football Players) and I miti dell’azione (Myths of Action), respectively. The work in oil on panel (90 x 117 cm) is in the Galleria Arte Centro in Milan. Trasfigurazione dell’Atleta could not be identified. However, there is a 1934 painting by Prampolini titled I funerali del romanticismo: trasfigurazione estetica (The funeral of romanticism: aesthetic transfiguration) (wood on chipboard, 117 x 89.5 cm) in the Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art of Trento and Rovereto. Possibly the title was here adapted to the event.",

He was a representative of the so-called Düsseldorf brick architecture and was classified as an architect of New Objectivity between World War I and the Weimar Republic. As an example, he designed the interior of the high speed steamer “Bremen”, but also department stores, mine shafts and churches. From 1928-46 Wach owned an office in Düsseldorf together with his colleague Heinrich Rosskotten. His entry in the art competitions was most likely his draft for the so-called Schlageter-Forum in Düsseldorf, developed for a competition advertised by the Hitler Youth in 1934. Around the already existing monument for Albert Leo Schlageter, a complex would be created with an open-air stage for 100,000 persons, an exhibition area and a stadium park. The Rhine stadium by Balduin Schilling was to be integrated in the latter. Although Wach won a “first prize”, the winner of the competition was Erich, Herr zu Putlitz. In the projected form, the plans were never implemented. Karl Wach had already designed a Reichsehrenmal mit Stadion (Reich cenotaph with stadium) in 1926, which was to be built on two islands in the river Rhine near Lorch.

Concurrently he attended numerous art schools, and eventually an applied arts college in Budapest, studying painting. By 1912 he had a favorable reputation in the Hungarian art world and a national championship title in the 30 kilometer walk, which led him to travel to that year’s Summer Olympic Games in Stockholm at his own expense. In the 10 kilometer walk he finished eighth in his opening heat of thirteen competitors and did not advance. He also started in the marathon, but was among the half of the runners who dropped out of the race due to the extreme heat. Ripszám served in the Austrian-Hungarian army during World War I and was deployed to the Eastern/Polish front, but was captured in 1915 and did not return home until the end of the conflict. After the war he remained active in orienteering and helped design his nation’s first stamp depicting sports, which was an effort to support the Hungarian delegation to the 1924 Summer Olympics. Ripszám’s efforts succeeding in providing sufficient funding for the Hungarian Athletics Association, who were previously unable to fully finance the journey to Paris for the track and field athletes. In 1926 he emigrated to Sweden, and then Britain, and spent the rest of his life in England as an artist specializing in paint and sculpture, although many of his works were destroying during the bombing of World War II.

He then travelled to Tokyo where he won the Pre-Olympic tournament with a knockout over Japanese fighter Tadayuki Maruyama. Although he had emerged as one of the favourites for the Olympic title, before he could represent Italy in Tokyo, he still had the matter of defeating Sauradi to gain selection. This was duly achieved. At the Olympics Pinto had a relatively straightforward path to the final but then came up against the Soviet Aleksey Kiselyov who had greatly impressed in the preliminary bouts. The fight developed into a fairly negative affair. Two judges awarded the contest to the Italian by a single point whilst the other three had the two men level at 59 points apiece. Two of the tied judges awarded their preference to Kiselyov but crucially the German judge opted for Pinto and the man from Novara was crowned Olympic champion. After the victory in Tokyo Pinto won two Italian championships (1965 and 1967) and in 1967 he was bronze medal winner at the European Championships held in Roma. Pinto decided to retire from boxing prior to the Mexico City Olympics whilst still only 25 years of age to concentrate on his career as a bank official.",Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the Mediterranean Games (1–0–0 1963 Napoli BOX gold: light-heavyweight -81 kg) Listed in Olympians Who Received the Italian Olympic Association (CONI) Gold Medal ()

In 1938, the athlete also competed at the European Championships, winning a gold medal with a world record jump of 1.67 [5-5¾]. Ratjen was eventually outed as a man, Heinrich “Heinz” Ratjen, who had disguised himself as a woman while competing in athletics events. The rumor has been for years that Ratjen later spoke out, stating that the Nazis forced him to do this in order to help win more medals for Germany at the 1936 Berlin Olympics. But more recent evidence suggests that Ratjen’s gender was mixed from birth, and his parents raised him as a girl, although he had hermaphroditic sexual characteristics. He was outed in September 1938 after the European Championships, on the train back to Köln (Cologne). A criminal investigation ensued, but no fraud was charged and the case was soon dropped. In January 1939 his father wrote to the registry officer, requesting an official change of sex and name, to Heinrich, on all official documents. Very little is known of his later life. It was originally written in a Time magazine article that he worked for a time as a waiter in Hamburg and Bremen, and in that article his name was listed as Hermann, which was copied for many years. However, it appears he returned to his native Bremen, where he ran his parent’s bar. His appearance in the Berlin Olympics and the exclusion of his teammate, the Jewish Gretel Bergmann, was the subject of the German movie Berlin ‘36 released in September 2009. Bergmann, when interviewed in 2009, still insisted that a Nazi plan to disguise Ratjen as a man to compete at the 1936 Olympics, in her stead, did exist.

Baum also designed buildings on the campus of his former university. He died of a heart attack in Times Square. Since 1909, the region of the Saratoga mineral water springs in New York has been a state park. Starting in 1928, the facility has been upgraded with new buildings. Baum designed the “Victoria Pool and Recreation Center” and the bottling plant for the mineral water. The Recreation Group is a complex of four neo-Georgian brick buildings that, with the interconnected Roman arcades, encloses an open-air courtyard with wide terraces and the pool itself.

It was not in the legal profession that the young Tincler made his name, however, but as a world-class professional runner on both sides of the Atlantic. Tincler learned his running skills at school, firstly at Quernmore School, Bromley, Kent, and then at Rathmines School in Dublin. While studying at TCD he carried off the Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA) one-mile title in both 1892 and 1893. A former Clonliffe Harrier, Tincler turned professional in 1894 under the alias “J. Craig of Inverness” (he was living in Inverness at the time) and made his professional début at Powderhall, Edinburgh. He soon became established as one of the world’s great milers, as well as an outstanding two- and three-miler. In 1897 he travelled to the USA to meet the Irish-American Tommy Conneff. Held at The Massachusetts Oval in front of a 10,000 crowd, including Theodore Roosevelt, Tincler won easily in a staggering 4:15.2. That year he won 35 of 36 races during his American tour, including the American 2-Mile Championship. He also recorded an unofficial 4:08.0 in a time trial. The year after his return from America, Tincler beat Fred Bacon in a much-awaited clash for the Professional World Mile Championship at Rochdale, winning in 4:16.4. Interestingly, at the 1899 and 1900 Waterloo Cup (coursing) meeting at Altcar, near Southport, a greyhound by the name of George Tincler was entered. Tincler (the human) was entered for the 400 and 1,500 metres professional races at the 1900 Paris Oympics but did not start either. During his racing days, Tincler was known as “The Gander” because of his unusual posture when running. He later emigrated to South Africa where he became an athletics coach. He died there in 1937",

He won his welterweight bout against Alex Ireland, the man he beat in the semi-final on his way to winning his ABA title.

In 1905 he was one of the founders of “Die Brücke” and soon one of the most important German Expressionists. His greatest strengths were landscape paintings and prints (woodcuts, lithographs, and etchings) with an idealized idea of primitive life. He was active for almost six decades. Over time his pictures became more melancholic and spiritualized in the sense of magic realism. Although in 1934 he signed the call of cultural workers in support of Adolf Hitler, he was banned from exhibiting after 1937. More than 700 of his works were removed as “Degenerated Art” from German museums. In the burning of paintings on 20 March 1939 in Berlin, the Nazis destroyed thousands of paintings, watercolors, and prints. After World War 2, Heckel was appointed professor in Karlsruhe, and in 1955 he took part in the “documenta 1” exhibition in Kassel. In his last years, he gave most of his works to the Brücke Museum in Berlin. On both his 70th and 80th birthdays, major retrospectives were held, as his works were now shown in all the great museums of the world. In 1974 his painting Sleeping Pechstein for the German Post stamp series “German Expressionism” and in 1994 his painting Landscape near Dresden were selected for another series “German paintings of the 20th century”. He was married to dancer Milda Frieda Georgi (1891-1982), also known as „Siddi Riha“. Several preliminary studies and sketches do exist of his 1928 entry Badende am Main (Bathers at the River Main). The work, which shows a scene near Würzburg, is shown in the exhibition catalog of German entries in 1928. A version from Whitsunday 1927 (oil on canvas, 96 x 120 cm) was later destroyed.

But with his bold jumps and spins, Dick Button ushered in a newer, modern era of athleticism on ice. His record clearly makes him the most dominant figure skater, male or female, of the modern era. Dick Button won the U.S. men’s title from 1946 through 1952, the world title from 1948 until 1952, and two Olympic gold medals. In 1948 he became the first American to win the European championship, and it was promptly changed to a closed event. From 1946 on, he was beaten only once, in a highly controversial decision at the 1947 world championships, where he outscored the Swiss skater Hans Gerschwiler but was relegated to second place by ordinal scores. So dominant was Button that at the 1952 Olympics, he became the first and only individual to be placed first by every Olympic judge in every phase of the competition. Button was the first skater to perform several risky jumps in competition, among them the double axel and triple toe loop. In 1949 he won the Sullivan Award, emblematic of the outstanding amateur athlete in the country – the first winter athlete to be so honored. Button graduated Harvard in 1952 and finished law school there in 1956. He became an announcer for televised figure skating events but he also formed his own company which, among other things, sponsored professional skating competitions.",Torchbearer within the Olympic Stadium at the Opening Ceremony of the 2002 Winter Olympics (Torch bearer within stadium) Bearer of the Olympic Flag at the opening ceremony of the 1980 Winter Olympics Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the European Figure Skating Championships (1–0–0 1948 Praha gold: singles) Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the World Figure Skating Championships (5–1–0 1947 Stockholm silver: singles; 1948 Davos gold: singles; 1949 Paris gold: singles; 1950 London gold: singles; 1951 Milano gold: singles; 1952 Paris gold: singles) Listed in Olympians Who Were Awarded the James E.

With the 1972 Winter Games about to be hosted by Sapporo the Japanese public looked to Yukio Kasaya to challenge for an Olympic title. Kasaya’s credentials were impressive as, two years earlier, he had become the first from his nation to win a medal at the World Nordic Skiing Championship and he arrived in Sapporo on the back of a string of victories on the European circuit. Kasaya would have been an overwhelming favourite to win the 1972 Four Hills tournament had he not missed the final event to prepare for the Olympics back home in Japan. After the disappointment of the Japanese performances in men’s 500m speed skating, the expectation of the home supporters was focussed on the home ski jumpers. Instead of crumbling under the ferocious pressure Kasaya literally flew away with the title. He led the field in both rounds and spearheaded an unprecedented 1-2-3 for the Japanese jumpers. Unsurprisingly he was feted as a national hero for his achievement.

His first assignment after graduation was as a resident and fisheries doctor on the Lofoten Islands. In 1884, he returned to Bergen and served as general physician, surgeon and gynecologist at Bergen Private Clinic and later the Red Cross Clinic. As a doctor, he was highly appreciated for his helpfulness towards the poor. He was also active as a local politician and chairman of the sailing association. Friele was a prominent sailor even prior to World War I. His first experiences, however, came in rowing, where he won 13 first prizes in local races and was known for his stamina. He joined the Bergen Seilbaadforening in 1889. During the first years he took part in local regattas as a member of the crew or in boats borrowed from other members. Friele bought his first boat in 1898 and named it Skum. With this boat, he competed internationally, sailing to the venues even in bad weather. In 1904, he won his first international races off Göteborg, Sweden. He purchased the Skum II in 1908, a technically up-to-date boat constructed by Johan Anker. With the new boat, he took first prize at the first regatta in Bergen in 1909. He then sailed to Kiel and København (Copenhagen), again winning several first places in the 10 m class. Even though he remained at the top level in Scandinavia with this boat, technical progress demanded further developments in construction. In 1914 Friele had a new 12 m yacht built for him named Skum III, designed by Charles Nicholson and again constructed by Anker. This boat, however never met expectations. World War I broke out and competitions were limited to Scandinavia, which was not involved. Because he was not successful even regionally, Friele sold the boat after only two years. With Skum IV and Skum V, both older boats he continued to compete successfully on a regional level. In 1919 Friele started preparing for the Antwerpen Olympics as helmsman on Olaf Ørvig’s 12 m yacht Heira II. After the Olympics Friele confined himself to tour sailing and founded the KNS Turseilingspokalen in 1922. The jury gave the first cup to Friele himself. His entire sailing career spanned a period of more than 30 years until Skum V was sold in 1924.",

A switch to the Finn Class followed and he went on to win the European Championship in 1998. Percy spent many months training and competing off Sydney in the years preceding the 2000 Olympics and it paid off handsomely when he won the Olympic title so comfortably that he did not even have to compete in the final race of the series. He swapped classes again in 2001 to the two-man Star boat but, although he and partner Steve Mitchell were world champions in 2002, they could not translate that success to the Athens Games.

68911,Jack Braughton,Male,22 February 1921,,, Great Britain,GBR,"At the 1948 Olympics, Jack Broughton took part in the 5,000 metres and whilst the record books show that he was eliminated in his heat, they don’t tell the true story of his appearance on the Wembley track. A building site manager, Braughton had to ask for time off work to go to the Olympics which was granted by his boss, but it meant him losing pay – there was no sponsorship or other funding in those days. Fortunately for Braughton, his heat was on a Saturday, which meant losing just half a day’s pay as he only worked on a Saturday morning, not the full day. He left his home in Peckham and made his way on public transport to Wembley Stadium, got changed, ran his heat, got changed again and returned home in time for tea with his wife, who was not interested in watching him run. This was the only time he ran in a Great Britain shirt and, because of his need to earn money, he turned down a chance to tour New Zealand with the AAAs. Jack Braughton started running when he was at Grimsby technical college and later joined Cleethorpes Harriers and, after they closed, Grimsby Harriers, and in 1939 won the Eastern-Counties Junior Cross-Country title. He carried on running during his Army days in India, but after the war he began running again seriously in his quest to compete at the London Olympics. He joined the famous Blackheath Harriers that boasted such notable members as the the young Gordon Pirie, Charles Wiard and Sydney Wooderson at that time. Braughton finished fourth in the AAA three miles in 1948 and that year won the first of four consecutive Surrey three miles titles until dethroned by Pirie in 1952. Braughton finished sixth in the 1955 Polytechnic Marathon in 2-36:04 – it was his first ever race over the distance and was the be his personal best time for the distance. Jack Braughton embodied all that was good about amateur sport in those days. A true amateur he fully believed in Baron de Coubertin’s creed and thoroughly enjoyed running, win or lose. He had no coach or mentor, trained just twice a week and was still competing until he was 80 when, as he said he: “Ran out of opponents”. He was still running socially until his 90s, when he also went ballroom dancing four times a week. Personal Best: 5000 – unknown.",

His grandfather Frederick Cavill, known as Professor of Swimming in Australia, was a professional swimmer in England, whose attempt to cross the English Channel fell just three miles short in 1876. After emigrating to Australia, Frederick Cavill became a renowned swimming instructor and owner of several baths in Sydney area. Eve’s uncles Ernest, Charles, Percy, Arthur, Sydney and Richmond all became very successful amateur and professional swimmers, who dominated the swimming scene at the end of 19th and start of 20th century. Later they all became renowned swimming instructors and stunt swimmers. Arthur is credited as the originator of Australian crawl stroke, which now predominates in freestyle swimming races, Sydney was the originator of butterfly stroke and Richmond was the first to use the crawl in competition. All three daughters of Frederick Cavill were also very good swimmers and worked as swimming instructors, including Eve’s mother Fredda. The Cavill family was jointly inducted into the International Swimming Hall of Fame in 1970. Dick Eve was taught to swim and dive at an early age by his mother and from 1915 he was with the Manly Amateur Swimming Club. Although Eve won the Australian springboard (or fancy diving as it was then called) championships every time from 1921-24, he was not considered a medal contender at the 1924 Olympics, due to his lack of international experience. At the Olympics, however, Eve won a surprising gold medal in the first diving event contested at Paris, the plain high diving. Next the springboard was contested, but Eve managed only to finish fifth due to recurrent ear trouble and his performances were below form. His medical condition forced him to withdraw from the platform. A few weeks later, Eve also won the British ASA springboard title. In 1925 Eve won both springboard and plain high diving (contested for the first time) titles at the Australian championships, but after succeeding his father as manager of Manly Swimming Baths in 1926, Eve’s amateur status was questioned and he had to retire from competition. In the 1930s, Eve managed the Pavilion at Manly and later worked as a wool classer, having studied wool classing through Sydney Technical College in 1921. During World War II, Eve enlisted with the Australian Imperial Force in March 1942, and served as a gunner in the Middle East until February 1943. Eve also remained involved in aquatics for most of his life and reportedly taught Murray Rose to swim. An examiner for the Royal Life Saving Society, Dick devised the Eve Rocker, a resuscitation device.",

Due to the world depression no Swiss team was sent to Los Angeles, but Miez elected to travel alone to compete, but also to bring home his brother, who had died in the United States some time before. At the 1932 Olympics Miez, who was only allowed to participate after a vote of the other nations competing in gymnastics, only competed in his favorite event, floor exercise, which was held for the first time at the Olympics. Disappointed and worried about the judging after winning only silver, he did not expect a fair competition, and withdrew from the Games, embarking on a trip through the US, where he also worked and held speeches at universities. In 1934 Miez competed at his only World Championships, where he won gold on floor and with the team and silver in horizontal bar. In 1936 he finally also won Olympic gold on floor and retired after the Games.

Fry and Max Woosnam as one of Britain’s greatest all-round sportsmen, but without the notoriety of Fry or Woosnam. Many times captain of the England hockey team, Borrett was also captain of the silver medal-winning Great Britain team at the 1948 London Olympics. He also captained the England squash team, and won the British Amateur Championship in the first five years after World War II, 1946-50, without dropping a set in any of the five finals. Only a bout of food poisoning prevented a possible sixth consecutive win in 1951. The son of a farmer, Borrett was educated at Framlingham College in Suffolk where he showed his talent as an all-round sportsman. By the time he left Framlingham, he had captained the cricket, squash, hockey, fives, athletics and swimming teams. He was also secretary of the debating society and was the school captain. Borrett then went to Pembroke College Cambridge in 1936, where he studied geography. He won two hockey and three squash Blues, and captained Cambridge in both sports. He won the first of his 30 full England hockey caps in 1939. During his time at Cambridge, Barrett played First Class cricket for Essex, but strangely never played for the university. He played one more game for Essex after the War and then played in the Minor Counties with Devon from 1947-59 His sporting abilities extended beyond hockey, squash and cricket. He played golf off a handicap of 4, and won enough tennis tournament ranking events to qualify for Wimbledon, but was too busy to take part. He was also invited by a friend to be his co-driver in the Le Mans 24-hour race, but declined. After service in the Army during World War II, Borrett became a schoolteacher in Devon between 1945-50, and then at his old school Framlingham from 1950-80. He held some important posts over the years including president of both the Squash Racquets Association and Hockey Association, and was chairman of the England hockey selectors. He also wrote two instructional books on how to play hockey: “Improving Your Hockey” (1950) and “Hockey for Men and Women” (1955). Borrett was also the subject of Richard Sayer’s 2011 book “Master Sportsman: The Story of Norman Borrett.” The sporting career of Norman Borrett was remarkable, but when one thinks of how much better it could have been had the war years not deprived him from competing between the ages of 22 and 29. Despite being diagnosed with arthritis in both hips at the age of 35, he continued playing international squash until the age of 38 and cricket for Devon until he was 42.",Listed in Olympians Who Played First-Class Cricket (Played 3 First Class matches (Essex))

It commemorated the missing aviators and was built in 1928 in Étretat on the Normandy coast. Here, the plane had left French territory never to appear again. Rey was the architect, while the sculptural part was designed by Alexandre Joseph Descatoire (1874–1949) and Gaston Petit (1890-84).

The novel portrays the life of Boetius, the son of an impoverished nobleman, finding confirmation in the taming of his stallion Cyrus. Later he goes back to his hometown of Bruxelles (Brussels) and accepts “proletarian work” in a turbine factory. Only the chapters with reference to sports (riding, fencing, swimming in a boarding school) were submitted. It took a great effort to prepare the four required copies for the jury in Amsterdam. The story was again published after 1930, mostly under the title The Aristocrat. Until today, numerous new editions have been released, even as an e-book. Weiß was an Austrian-born Jew. He studied medicine and first worked as a ship’s doctor. He began publishing novels after he met famous Czech writer Franz Kafka in 1913. After World War I Weiß settled in Praha (Prague) as a physician, but in 1921 he moved to Berlin as a freelance writer. In 1933 Weiß immigrated again to Praha and then to Paris. Since he could not work further as a doctor, he mainly wrote books and articles for immigrant journals. When the German Nazi troops entered Paris, he took his own life by cutting his wrists and also swallowing poison.","Listed in Olympians Who Were Killed or Missing in Action or Died as a Result of War (†15 June 1940.

Unfortunately, at the Berlin Games, Middleton finished fifth in his 100 metres heat, and failed to qualify for the final.

9773,Frank Prout,Male,7 July 1921,,, Great Britain,GBR,"Frank Prout was the son of a Plymouth children’s book author. In 1922 the family moved by motorbike and sidecar to Canvey Island and built a bungalow on a plot of land they had bought. Frank and his older brother Roland enjoyed the outdoor-life at their new home, and when the two siblings were barely five-years-of-age, their father built them a canoe in which to traverse a local creek. Their father started a boat-building business in 1935 and Frank and Roland helped out in the business whenever they could. The business eventually became very successful as G. Prout & Sons. In 1964, one of their catamarans was the first multihull vessel to circumnavigate the earth, and in 1989 they won a Queen’s Award for Industry. During World War II, Frank wanted to join the Royal Navy but couldn’t, because his mother was Swiss. Instead he became a fitter with the Royal Air Force in the Middle East. He later obtained his wings and became a flying instructor. In 1948 he married his wife Erica, who was also a keen sailor, and the newlyweds’ “honeymoon” consisted of a 140-mile cruise in a Prout canoe around the south-east coast of England from Eastbourne to Canvey Island. In addition to sailing and canoeing, Frank was also a keen boxer and badminton player, and played rugby for the Southend first XV. Frank and Erica were both also fine golfers. To relax, Frank enjoyed playing the clarinet and harmonica, painting, calligraphy, and wood carving. For his 80th birthday he flew a Tiger Month, one of the first planes he flew after obtaining his wings. In the early 1950s, Prouts made the world’s first production catamaran, the Shearwater, and with it came the Shearwater class of racing. Prouts catamarans became well known all over the world, and in 1963 they launched the 77ft (23.5m) Tsulamaran at Canvey Island. It was the largest European-built catamaran at the time. Frank and Roland Prout were no newcomers to canoe racing in the post-war era and won seven prizes at the Chertsey regatta in 1949, An outdated amateur status rule, however, forbade them from competing in National Championships because they were professional boat builders. This rule changed, however, and in 1951 they made up for their long absence by winning the K-2 1,000 and 10,000 metres titles at the 1951 National Championships. They added the K-2 500 in 1952, had a clean sweep of all three kayak pairs titles in 1953, and rounded off their career by capturing the K-2 1,000 and 10,000 in 1954. Prior to the 1952 Olympics, the siblings spent some weeks in Sweden training with the 1948 Olympic gold medallist Hans Berglund, but they disappointed at Helsinki by finishing seventh and last in their opening heat in the K-2 1,000 metres.",Brother of Roland Prout

He took part in his first race at the age of 17 and three years later was established as the top rider in the country. Southall would often win time trials so easily that cycling magazines coined the term “Southall margin” to describe an overwhelming race victory. In 1925 he broke the national hour record and was chosen for his first World Championship road race in Amsterdam. At the 1928 Olympic Games Southall won silver medals individually and as part of the British road race team but was convinced that he had been unfairly treated and cheated out of two Olympic titles. British officials protested that the Danish gold medalist Henry Hansen had taken a short cut in one of the wooded sections of the course but no evidence was found and the appeal was rejected. Southall added another Olympic medal, a bronze, in the team pursuit at the 1932 Olympics before electing to leave his job as a plasterer to ride professionally for Hercules Bicycles. He focused on point-to-point and 24-hour record attempts during his time as a pro before gradually ending his career to focus on an executive job with Hercules which involved managing the career his employer’s female cyclists.",Brother of Monty Southall

His father was sickly, they lived under harsh material conditions and he had to contribute to the family’s budget by forestry work in the winter. When he showed his talent a local merchant let him run in the forests between small villages and isolated places with an order block from the sports and hardware store where customers could sign up for deliveries. After some time his native village became too small and he changed clubs to train and run more professionally. He competed for Åsele NS 1945-49, Skellefteå SK 1950-54 and Östersund SK 1955-57. Even though Josefsson had only a few top results in 1950 before he traveled to the World Championships in Lake Placid and Rumford, he did extremely well, winning three medals, with individual silvers in he 18 and 50 km. Therefore, he was sometimes called “the eternal runner-up,” before he won World Championship gold in the relay, running the last leg for Sweden. At the next Winter Olympics in Oslo, Sweden again won the bronze medal with three skiiers returning from the 1950 World team, Josefsson now on third leg. In the same season, Josefsson was the best Swedish skier in the 18 km at the Swedish Ski Games in Falun as runner-up behind the winner Viljo Vellonen of Finland. He was back in Falun during the 1954 World Ski Championship, participating in all three individual events with the best result being ninth place in two events. Josefsson’s only individual Swedish Championship came in 1952 in the 30 km, when he also placed second in 15 and 50 km events. Here, he received the trophy “for best performance” from Princess Sibylla’s hands.

920923,Paolo Vietti Violi,Male,20 June 1882,,, Italy,ITA,"Italian architect Paolo Vietti Violi was born in Switzerland to Italian parents, and first studied in Geneva, before moving to Paris. In 1914, he settled in Milano where he founded his own architectural studio. He then became well-known as a designer of sports facilities like stadiums and race tracks. He also focused on the infrastructure around sports fields like railways, footways, road links and parking facilities. Vietti Violi worked internationally, with projects in Addis Ababa, Ankara, Istanbul, Adana, Izmir, Belgrade, Sofia, and Valencia. Among his well-known works were the racecourses of Milano (San Siro Racecourse), Monza (Mirabello Racecourse), Napoli (Agnano Racecourse) and Rimini, as well as trotting racecourses in Milano, Bologna and Firenze. He also designed stadiums in Ankara, Istanbul, Genoa, L’Aquila, Merano, and Saronno. He worked repeatedly over a period of 30 years, especially in Turkey. Vietti Violi’s other projects included hospitals, factories, theaters, basilicas, public facilities, and workers’ villages. His 1928 entries included, amongst others, the Palazzo dello Sport (today Palazzo delle Scintille), designed in 1922 as a multi-functional building with a huge dome of iron and glass for exhibitions, shows and sporting events an opened in April 1923 with a motor show, the horse race tracks of San Siro, designed in 1912 with neo-classical buildings grandstands but only inaugurated in 1920, of Mirabello, designed according to the English cottage style or a Norman farmhouse and opened in 1925, and of Capannelle in Roma, rebuilt in 1926 inspired by the style of Art Deco, as well as the NAFTA Stadium, designed in 1912 but only inaugurated in 1927 with heavily overhanging bleachers made of reinforced concrete, which is now, after a complete reconstruction in 1980s called Stadio Giacomo Carlini. The Cavallerizza in Milan (1929) remained a plan as well as the Centro polisportivo” for Rome, a competition design from 1926. S.I.R.E. (Società Incremento Razze Equine) was founded in 1919 as a society for the promotion of horse breeding. In 1921, this company and S.I.A.S., the Association for the Promotion of Automobile and Sports, were granted right of use in a large part of the former Royal Park. Construction began in 1922 for a 14 km long racetrack with four curves and three straights. The course was changed again shortly thereafter to preserve the trees of the park. Nevertheless, the first races were held in 1922. In 1938, the route was modified again. The leaders behind the construction of the track were Arturo Mercanti and Silvio Crespi, both former presidents of the Milan Automobile Club. The architect was Alfredo Rosselli in collaboration with the civil engineer Piero Puricelli. At the same time (1922-24), the Hippodrome was commissioned by S.I.R.E. adjacent to the race track. It is unclear why the entry was associated with S.I.R.E. and not with S.I.A.S. The Hippodrome was one of the projects submitted by Paolo Vietti Violi. However, the catalog of the art exhibition clearly refers to the Autodrome de Monza.",

At the 1968 Olympics, Forbes ran the 4×100 for Jamaica, equaling the world record of 38.6 in the opening round, and then bettering it in the semi-finals with 38.3, before finishing fourth in the final. Forbes later competed at the 1970 Commonwealth Games, where he finished seventh in the 400. After his retirement from competition, Forbes served as a manager for Jamaican teams at the Olympic Games, Commonwealth Games, Central America and Caribbean Games, and Pan American Games, and was also a trainer for the national netball team. In business, Forbes worked as an administrator for Cable And Wireless (later LIME), a telecommunication company, and also consulted with the Jamaica Olympic Committee.

Taylor turned professional shortly after the Olympics. Taylor won all his early fights and in 1988 defeated Buddy McGirt by TKO in the 12th to win the IBF light-welterweight title. In March 1990, Taylor fought a unification bout against WBA light-welterweight champion Julio César Chávez. The fight had a huge media presence, as both fighters were undefeated (Taylor at 24-0-1, and Chávez 68-0), and Chávez was usually considered the best boxer in the world, pound-for-pound. Taylor controlled the fight in the early rounds, and although Chávez began wearing him down in the later rounds, Taylor led by wide margins on two of the three judges’ cards going into the final 12th round. With 17 seconds left Chávez floored Taylor. With two seconds remaining, referee Richard Steele asked Taylor if he was OK, and when he looked blankly at his corner, Steele stopped the fight, giving Chávez victory by TKO. Feeling he was weak in that fight because he had to drop weight, Taylor moved up in class and in 1991 defeated Aaron Davis for the IBF welterweight title. In 1992 he moved up to junior-middleweight but was knocked out in the fourth round by Terry Norris in a fight for the WBC title. This marked the beginning of the end for Taylor’s career. He fought Chávez again in 1994 but, well past his prime, lost by a TKO in eight. Taylor retired in 2002 with a career record of 38 wins, 8 losses, and 1 draw.",Listed in Olympic Boxers Who Won a Professional World Championship (Olympics - 1984 Featherweight (Gold); Professional World Champion - IBF Super-Lightweight (1988-1990); WBA Welterweight (1991-1992).)

Birch competed in the Isle of Man TT three times, with his best finish being 16th in the 1927 Senior TT.

That same year he was pipped for third place in the junior GP by two seconds. He competed in the Manx GP eight times, finishing in the top eight on four occasions. It was with a touch of irony that in 1922, Birch had been fined ten shillings (50 pence), by the Morecambe Borough Court, for riding a motor cycle - without a driving licence! The same year that Birch enjoyed his best Isle of Man finish, 1928, he teamed up with Henry Martineau, Eddie Hall, John Gee and John, Earl of Stair in the Great Britain II bobsleigh at the St. Moritz Olympics.

Costa began bowling in the mid-1970s taking up the sport seriously in 1979 when he took part in the Tournament of the Americas in Miami, Florida. Costa’s best success came at the 1985 Tournament of the Americas where he won all the events he competed in. Costa represented Brazil at the 1988 Seoul Olympics when bowling was a demonstration sport. He was one of just 12 men who competed in the tournament finishing in ninth place. The Brazilian Olympic Committee (BOC) were ill-prepared for bowling at the Olympics, not realizing it was a sport, and not even having a uniform for Costa to wear for the Opening Ceremony. Costa’s own experience of the Olympics was a disappointment due to losing his job to attend the Games and the scheduling of the event taking place in a single day. Despite the initial let down from the BOC at the 1988 Olympics, bowling eventually made its way onto the program for the Pan American Games in 1991. Costa represented Brazil at the 2003 Pan American Games in the Dominican Republic. He also took part at the 2010 South American Games in Colombia where he won two bronze medals.",

FIG concluded its investigations a month after the Games, reporting that it was unable to find fault with any of the officially reported birth dates of the Chinese gymnasts. This meant that Yang was allowed to keep the three medals she won in Beijing. After having earned the gold in the team all-around, she had added bronze in the individual all-around. She led after the qualification for the uneven bars, but dropped to third in the final, behind He Kexin, who was also suspected of being underage.

He turned professional in 1993 with the Belgian Lotto team and won 51 races over the next six years, with his major palmares including Paris-Bruxelles in 1995, Paris-Nice and Ghent-Wevelgem in 1998, and in his best year of 1999, he won the Omloop Het Volk, Liège-Bastogne-Liège and two stages at the Vuelta a España, while also winning the Points Jersey in Spain. But he never won another major race. Vandenbroucke had several troubled relationships notably a 2000 marriage to former model Sarah Pinacci, which deteriorated into constant fighting. They finally divorced in 2006. Vandenbroucke also began to have difficulty with drugs in 1999, when he was first arrested and released by Paris police. In 2001 he was stopped in a speeding car in Belgium, riding with Dr. Bernard Sainz. Their car was found to be loaded with drugs such as clenbuterol, morphone, and EPO (erythropoietin). He was banned for six months by the Belgian cycling federation, and in 2004, he would admit to taking growth hormone, EPO, steroids, and morphine. He was found guilty in a Belgian court in 2005 and sentenced to 200 hours of community service, which was later commuted to a fine of €250,000. In his 2007 autobiography, Je ne suis pas Dieu, Vandenbroucke admitted to taking performance-enhancing drugs, stating, “Everybody did it [used dope], and so did I. It is the truth and it does not diminish the value of my victories.” He also admitted in the book to using multiple recreational drugs. Vandenbroucke also began to suffer from depression, diagnosed for the first time in 2004, and in June 2007, he injected himself with a series of drugs in an unsuccessful suicide attempt, leaving a farewell letter. Knee problems, which hampered his riding ability after 2000, also contributed to his depression. He died while on holiday in Senegal, the official cause listed as a pulmonary embolism.",

Graf von Salm-Hoogstraeten lost in the singles quarter-finals at the 1912 Olympics. Born to wealthy German nobility, he inherited a fortune because he was the oldest child. Graf von Salm-Hoogstraeten, or Ludi, as he was known, was primarily known as a doubles player. In 1914 he reached the mixed doubles final at the French Championships and the doubles final at the World Hard Court Championships. He played Wimbledon once, prior to the war, losing in the second round of singles, but did better by reaching the All-Comers final of the 1914 French Championships. After the war, Ludi won the 1920 German doubles title alongside Oskar Kreuzer. He then fell victim to his own attitude and bad behavior on the court. In 1924 he was banned from all French Riviera clubs. In 1925 the Austrian Tennis Federation suspended his playing license. These bans were usually transient, but over the next few years, he had similar McEnrovian run-ins with the tennis authorities. Ludi was a dragoon officer in the Austrian Army and was a military aide to the Governor of Vienna during World War I. He lost much of his fortune in card games in the military. Ludi settled in Budapest where he became a wine merchant, and ironically, he gave tennis etiquette and fair-play lessons to Viennese children. He was married twice, and married well, the first time to Maria von Kramsta, a member of the wealthy Kramsta business family, and the second time to Mary Millicent Abigail Rogers, a socialite, fashion icon, and art collector, who was the granddaughter of Standard Oil tycoon Hennry Huttleston Rogers, and an heiress to his fortune. On 23 July 1944 Graf von Salm-Hoogstraeten jumped from the Hotel Dunapalota-Ritz balcony onto the Danube Promenade, killing himself instantly. Various reasons are given for his suicide. It is said he was escaping the Nazi SS, who were coming after him because he was Jewish. A friend, Sidney Wood, claimed the Nazis had asked him to become a spy, which he refused, and caused them to pursue him. Others said he was actually an anti-Semite and a Nazi collaborator, choosing suicide to avoid post-war reprisals.",Listed in Olympians Who Committed Suicide (Committed suicide by jumping to avoid capture by Nazis.)

In 1932, he also clocked a remarkable 16:46.4 in the 10,000 m, which was not recognized as a World Record because it was skated in a North American packstyle race. At home, Ballangrud won five Norwegian titles between 1926 and 1939. Retiring in 1939, Ballangrud attempted a comeback for the 1948 Olympics, but failed. Ballangrud was born as Ivar Eriksen, but received a new surname when his mother remarried after his father’s death. He worked in his own sporting good store in Drammen, and later Trondheim.

She split her sporting priorities between netball, where she was a member of the England junior team, and athletics, until she won a bronze medal at the 2003 European Junior Championships and decided to concentrate fully on the track. This move proved extremely beneficial and she duly won a place on the Olympic team after running a personal best to the win the British trials. She narrowly missed qualifying for the final of the 400 at both the Athens Olympics and the 2005 World Championships but was rewarded with her first major medal, a bronze in the 4×400 relay, at the latter championships. Ohuruogu started 2006 in sensational fashion as she defeated reigning World and Olympic champion Tonique Williams-Darling for the Commonwealth Games gold medal but ended ignominiously as she began a twelve-month ban for missing three out-of-competition doping tests. The ban ended in early August 2007 and she still had time to run a qualifying time for the 2007 World Championships. At those championships she impressively moved through the rounds and then produced a wholely unexpected performance to run past fading opponents and cross the line in first place, having broken 50 seconds for the first time ever. Though the field for the final of the Beijing Olympic 400 was stronger than the year before, the race developed as a carbon copy of the 2007 world final as once more Ohurougu kept her form as others faltered and powered home to become her nation’s first Olympic champion in the event. Since Beijing her form dipped and, although she was a finalist at the 2009 World Championships, her momentum was checked by a series of niggling injuries. She made the British team for the 2011 Worlds but, in a rare occurrence for a 400 metre runner, was disqualified for a false start. However, she returned to form to take the silver medal at the London Olympics in 2012, and then won her second 400m world title in 2013 before being part of the England team that won the bronze medal at the Commonweath Games in 2014. Ohuruogu won another relay bronze at Rio 2016 as she became only the second British track and field athlete after Steve Backley to win medals at three consecutive Olympics.","Sister of Victoria Ohuruogu Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the European Athletics Indoor Championships (1–0–0 2013 Göteborg gold: 4×400 m relay) Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the World Athletics Championships (2–1–5 2005 Helsinki bronze: 4×400 m relay; 2007 Osaka gold: 400 m, bronze: 4×400 m relay; 2009 Berlin bronze: 4×400 m relay; 2011 Daegu bronze: 4×400 m relay; 2013 Moskva gold: 400 m, silver: 4×400 m relay; 2015 Beijing bronze: 4×400 m relay) Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the World Athletics Indoor Championships (1–0–1 2012 İstanbul gold: 4×400 m relay; 2014 Sopot bronze: 4×400 m relay) Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the British Empire/Commonwealth Games (1–0–1 2006 Melbourne ATH gold: 400 m (competed for England); 2014 Glasgow ATH bronze: 4×400 m relay (competed for England))"

As a diver, he focused almost exclusively on the platform, but had the bad luck to dive in the same era as Greg Louganis, the greatest diver ever. Competing against Louganis, he won almost no major championships but was a frequent visitor to the podium. In addition to his Olympic silver, he was bronze medalist on the platform at the 1982 and 1986 World Championships and silver medalist at the 1983 Pan-American Games. The 1982 World Championship marked a great comeback for Kimball. In 1981, he was hit by a drunk driver. Fortunate to be alive, most of the bones in his face were broken, his left femur was broken, he sustained torn knee ligaments, a liver laceration, and he had to have his spleen removed. It was not certain if he could return to world-class diving, but he did so nine months after the accident. In August 1988, Kimball was on the other end of a drunk driving accident. Driving while inebriated, he plowed into a crowd of teenagers outside a popular night spot, killing two boys and injuring six others. The accident occurred just before the Olympic Trials, and there was great controversy over whether he should be allowed to compete in the Trials. Eventually he did compete but failed to make the 1988 Olympic team. He was sentenced to 17 years in prison after pleading guilty to vehicular manslaughter. He was released in 1993 after serving five years, but as part of his sentence his driving privileges were permanently revoked.

536,Lottie Dod,Female,24 September 1871,,, Great Britain,GBR,"Born the youngest of four children into an affluent family whose fortune was made in the cotton trade, Charlotte “Lottie” Dod benefitted from the construction of tennis courts on the family estate in Cheshire. Lottie joined the Rock Ferry Tennis Club in Birkenhead at the age of 11 and soon began to partner her sister in senior tournaments. At the age of 13 Dod reached the final of the Northern Championships where she seriously troubled Wimbledon champion Maud Watson before falling to defeat. The following year she ended Watson’s run of 55 consecutive victories when she beat her in the final of the West of England Championships. This emboldened Dod to enter Wimbledon for the first time in 1887, which proved a wise decision as the now 15-year-old, helped by a more relaxed dress code for players under the age of 18, dominated proceedings and won the title with a comfortable victory over Blanche Bingley. She retained her title in 1888 but played only one tournament in 1889 and 1890 before returning to win a further Wimbledon title in 1891. She retained her title in 1892 and 1893 and only lost five matches during her, admittedly brief, career. Her last tennis season as a competitive player was 1893 and she moved on to other pursuits. Although this was the end of her tennis career it was not the end of her sporting exploits. In winter she would decamp to Sankt Moritz where she perfected her skating well enough to become only the second woman to pass the Sankt Moritz Men’s Skating Test. She also became an accomplished curler and mountaineer and went down the Cresta Run on a toboggan. Autumn and spring were spent on the hockey pitch. After helping to set up the Spital Hockey club she became the team’s centre forward, went on to play county hockey for Cheshire and finally, in 1899 made her début for the England team in a victory over Ireland. She played against the same opponents the following year – this time scoring both of England’s goals in a 2-1 victory. In the summers she turned her attention to golf and helped to found a ladies golf club at Moreton on the Wirral Peninsular. In 1894 she entered the British Ladies Amateur Championship for the first time but had to wait four years to make an impact on the competition when she reached the first of her three semi-finals. She was absent from competitive play from 1901 to 1903 but returned in 1904 to record her one and only national title victory on the links at Troon. In 1905 the Dod family sold their Cheshire estate and moved south to Berkshire. Having occasionally competed in the sport, they joined the Welford Park Archery Club. Living up to the family tradition (their ancestor was reputed to have commanded the English archers at the Battle of Agincourt), Lottie and her brother William soon became proficient and in 1906 she finished fifth in the Grand National tournament. Lottie led the Olympic competition at the White City Stadium at the halfway stage but was overtaken by Queenie Newall on the second day of competition. For once her silver medal was overshadowed by her brother William Dod who unexpectedly won the Olympic title in the men’s event. In 1910 both brother and sister finished as runners-up in the Grand National Archery Meeting though this was to be their final hurrah as far as the sport was concerned. The Welford Archers disbanded in 1911 and the pair drifted away from the sport. Lottie volunteered as a nurse during World War I, serving in hospitals in London and Berkshire. Dod was a regular visitor to Wimbledon for the rest of her life and died peacefully in 1960 listening to radio commentary of The Championships. She was elected to the Tennis Hall of Fame in 1983.",Sister of William Dod

The war interrupted his career, however, and cancelled the 1940 Olympics, although later, in 1952, Kotkas did won an Olympic gold. As a youth Kotkas participated in weightlifting and took up wrestling only in 1935, when he was already 20-years-old. Soon, however, Kotkas rose to be the second best Estonian heavyweight wrestler behind Palusalu. Kotkas first took part in the Estonian Championships in 1936, where he won silver in freestyle heavyweight behind Palusalu. In 1937, in Palusalu’s absence, Kotkas won the Estonian freestyle heavyweight title but, at the 1937 Estonian Greco-Roman championships, Kotkas was again second behind Palusalu. In 1938 Kotkas again placed second behind Palusalu at the Estonian Greco-Roman Championships but, as Palusalu ended his career soon after due to a severe shoulder injury, Kotkas won his second Estonian freestyle title. That year Kotkas also participated at the European Greco-Roman Wrestling Championships, winning the heavyweight title, which he repeated in 1939. Before the World War II, Kotkas won both Estonian Greco-Roman and freestyle heavyweight titles in 1939. In 1940 the Soviet Union annexed Estonia and Kotkas continued his career by representing the Soviet Union. As the Soviet Union did not participate regularly at major international tournaments before the 1950s, Kotkas was not seen much in the international arena, but he won the 1947 European Greco-Roman heavyweight title, the 1953 World Greco-Roman heavyweight silver, and the 1956 World Cup. The high point of Kotkas’ career was at the 1952 Olympics, where he won the Greco-Roman heavyweight title in 13 minutes and 36 seconds, defeating all four of his opponents by fall. Domestically, Kotkas was nearly unbeatable, winning Soviet Greco-Roman heavyweight titles in 1940, 1943-46, 1948, 1950-53 and 1955-56, the 1947 Soviet freestyle heavyweight title, and the 1943 Soviet hammer throw title (with 53.88). Kotkas also won Soviet championships silver medals in freestyle heavyweight in 1946 and 1948, Greco-Roman heavyweight silver in 1949 and 1954, a sambo (a Soviet wrestling style similar to judo) heavyweight silver in 1951, hammer throw silver in 1946, hammer throw bronze in 1945 and 1947, and a shot put bronze in 1943. Kotkas was also Estonian SSR champion in Greco-Roman heavyweight in 1945-46, 1948-52 and 1954-59, Estonian SSR freestyle heavyweight champion in 1945, 1947-49 and 1951, Estonian SSR champion in heavyweight weightlifting in 1946 and Estonian SSR champion in the hammer throw in 1950. Kotkas finished his sporting career in 1960 and later worked as a wrestling coach and referee. From 1961-76 he was the head coach of the Estonian SSR wrestling team and, from 1976 until his retirement in the middle of 1980s, he worked as a wrestling coach with Dynamo Tallinn.

7107, Chicho,Male,3 October 1958,203.0,92, Spain,ESP,"Cándido Sibilio, better known as “Chicho”, was one of the stars of the successful Barcelona basketball team in the 1980s. Chicho, Epi (Juan Antonio San Epifanio) and Nacho (Ignacio Solozábal), were the star trio of the team that displaced Real Madrid as Spain’s leading club side. Born in the Dominican Republic, Sibilio was the youngest of seven children. He started playing basketball as a youngster but gave it up saying: “It was a girl’s sport”. He then turned to his first love, and the Dominican Republic’s number one sport, baseball. He was talked into returning to basketball, however, and American colleges soon had him in their sights, but Barcelona convinced Sibilio’s family to let him move to Spain, which he did in February 1976. Difficulties getting his citizenship, however, meant he could play only with the Barcelona juniors, until 1977, when he finally obtained his Spanish nationality. During Sibilio’s 13-years with the club, Barcelona won everything, except the European Cup (beaten by PV Roma in the 1984 final being the closest they came). Barcelona won the Spanish League five times, however, in 1981, 1983, 1987-89, and the Spanish Cup (Copa del Rey) on eight occasions, in 1978-83, 1987-88. Sibilio also won the European Cup-winners’ Cup twice, the Korac Cup, the Prince of Asturias Cup, and the Club World Cup. Personally, he averaged 18.8 points per game, and was the first player to make 650 “3-pointers” in the ACB (Asociación de Clubes de Baloncesto). Internationally, Sibilio won 87 Spanish caps, and scored 1,324 points, between 1980-87, and was the first black player to represent Spain. He made his début at the 1980 Moskva Olympics, scoring 17 points against the USSR. The highlight of his international career was in winning a silver medal at the 1983 European Championships (Eurobasket).

They continued to compete in championships in 1972 with a very successful series in the International Gold Cup in København (Copenhagen) in which they secured fifth place out of 72 dragons competing. With this excellent result, the 3 crew members Byrne, Robin Hennessy, and Eoin Delaney were heralded as potential medal winners in the upcoming Olympics; Byrne later described the opening ceremony as a moment to remember for a lifetime. The sailing events were held in Kiehl, where the Irish team’s luck ran out in such a competitive fleet when crew member Eoin Delaney became so ill that he was obliged to stand down and was flown home to Ireland. He was replaced by boat owner Joe McMenamin. According to Byrne, this change just before the Olympics upset the balance of the team, and the crew would go on to finish 16th in a field of 23 countries. Later that year, Byrne was also a member of the crew that competed in the European Championships held in Hyères, France. Byrne has remained active in sailing all his life.

He then joined the Under-23 British Olympic Academy and moved to Manchester where he shared a house with Ed Clancy and Mark Cavendish. Unfortunately, a serious training crash in Australia at the start of 2005 necessitated the removal of his spleen and ruined his year, but he returned in 2006 and won a bronze medal in the points race at the Commonwealth Games, representing Wales. Thomas won his first world senior title in the team pursuit at the World Championships in Palma de Mallorca in 2007, and, at 21, was the youngest rider in that year’s Tour de France. The British team, with Thomas as an important part of their success, retained the world title in 2008 and then put in a world record-breaking performance to take Olympic gold in Beijing. Thomas became a founder member of Sky Pro Cycling team (now Team Sky) at the end of 2009 and concentrated on road racing. He won his first national road race title in 2010 and then had an excellent 2011 season where he won his first stage race (the Bayern-Rundfahrt) and finished a creditable 31st in the Tour de France. Thomas won a gold medal with the four-man British pursuit team at the 2012 World Championships. The new foursome of Thomas, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Peter Kennaugh were favourites to retain the Olympic gold medal on home soil, and they set the fastest time in qualifying with a world record, and then broke it again in the final against their old rivals Australia as they won by nearly three seconds. Thomas won the gold medal in the road race at the 2014 Glasgow Commonwealth Games, and also won bronze in the individual time trial. He competed in his third Olympics in 2016, finishing 11th in the road race and 9th in the individual time trial. In 2018, Thomas reached the peak of his road career when he won the Tour de France, while riding for Team Sky.","Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the British Empire/Commonwealth Games (1–0–2 2006 Melbourne CYC bronze: points race (competed for Wales); 2014 Glasgow CYC gold: road race, bronze: individual time trial (competed for Wales)) Listed in Olympic Cycling Medalists and Tour de France Champions (2008 & 2012 Team Pursuit (Gold); 2018 Tour de France Champion)"

He had taken up running at the age of 15 and made his international debut at the 1962 British Empire and Commonwealth Games, coming in sixth in the 4x440 yards relay (with Don Bertoia, Lynn Eves, and George Shepherd). The following year he was awarded the Lou Marsh Trophy as Canada’s best athlete after posting the two fastest 880 yard times of the year and winning national tournaments in Canada, Great Britain, and the United States. He also graduated from the University of Toronto’s pharmacy school that year, but decided to continue his pursuit of amateur sports before beginning a career. He was selected for the 1964 Summer Olympics and won silver in the 800 metres, behind Peter Snell of New Zealand, and was also eliminated in the semifinals of the 400 metres. For this achievement he received the Lou Conacher Award as Canada’s top male athlete of the year. His best days coming to an end, Crothers continued to compete for several years and won the 800 m at the 1965 Summer Universiade. He then captured silver in the 4x440 yards relay (alongside Don Domansky, Ross MacKenzie, and Brian MacLaren) at the 1966 British Empire and Commonwealth Games. His final major international medals, silver, came in 800 m and the 4x400 m relay (with Mackenzie, MacLaren, and Robert McLaren) at the 1967 Pan American Games.

His ceiling decoration in the auditorium of the National Theater in Warszawa burned in 1939 during the German attack on Poland. In 1927 Kamiński created the Polish Coat of Arms, which is basically still in use today. He also created numerous works in collaboration with his wife, artist and sculptress Zofia Trzcińska-Kamińska (1890-1977). From 1915 Kamiński taught at the Warsaw Technical University, then became a professor and dean, a position he held again after World War II. In 1926 he was a founding member of the “Ryt” group of graphic artists.

After a brief excursion into cycling, he enlisted in the Guardia di Finanza and devoted himself entirely to skiing. He had his début at the 1960 Italian Championships, winning a relay title. Another 15 Italian titles followed during his career for a total of six in the relay and ten in individual events between 1960-71. His international career started at the 1964 Winter Olympics. Prior to the implementation of the World Cup, he scored several victories and top placements in Scandinavia, including a third place in Lahti and a fourth place at Holmenkollen. At the 1966 World Championships Nones won a relay bronze medal and was sixth in the 30 km. Two years later, he won gold in the 30 km race at the 1968 Winter Olympics in Grenoble leading from start-to-finish, thus becoming the first Italian Olympic cross-country champion, and the first Olympic cross-country champion from other than a Scandinavian country or the Soviet Union. Nones developed cold- and exericse-induced asthma, and as a result planned to retire prior to the 1972 Winter Olympics. But due to public pressure, he gave in and went to Sapporo, where he took part in only one event with a poor result. After retiring Nones continued to serve in the Guardia di Finanza with the rank of sergeant and coached local cross-country skiers. In 1970, he started a family business importing ski equipment, and a sport equipment line for cross-country skiing and cycling bears his name. With the death of skeleton racer Nino Bibbia in May 2013, Nones became the oldest living Italian Winter Olympics gold medalist.",Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the World Nordic Ski Championships (1–0–1 1966 Oslo CCS bronze: 4×10 km relay; 1968 Grenoble (Olympics) CCS gold: 30 km)

45262,Kevin O'Halloran,Male,3 March 1937,,, Australia,AUS,"Kevin O’Halloran was the first Western Australian to win an Olympic gold medal. Back in the middle of 20th century, competitive swimming was not well developed in Western Australia, there were few public pools, and races were held in muddy river pools. O’Halloran grew up in Kojonup, some 40 km west of Katanning, where his family lived on a 9,000-acre sheep farm established by his grandfather in 1900. But after his father enlisted during WW2, O’Halloran’s mother could no longer run the farm and raise the children by herself, so the family moved to Katanning, which was one of the few country towns in Western Australia that had a public swimming pool, where O’Halloran learned to swim. O’Halloran soon rose to be the best swimmer in the area and was Western Australian junior champion in 110 yds freestyle and 220 yds freestyle in 1952-53 and 110 yds butterfly champion in 1952. Moving up to the senior level, O’Halloran was the Western Australian champion in 110 yds freestyle and 220 yds freestyle in 1954-55 and 440 yds individual medley champion in 1955. In 1955 he also made his début at the Australian championships, finishing fifth in 110 yds freestyle. In late 1955, O’Halloran moved to Sydney in an attempt to qualify to the 1956 Olympics, and was successful. O’Halloran won his only medal at the Australian championships, a bronze in 440 yds freestyle, to earn an individual berth in the 400 free at the Melbourne Olympics, where, after finishing fourth in the 220 yds freestyle trial, he was also included on the Australian 4x200 m freestyle relay team. At the Olympics, O’Halloran first led the Australian relay team as a first leg swimmer to an Olympic gold with a world record of 8:23.6 and then finished fourth in the 400 free final. O’Halloran’s entire career was hampered by recurring ear infections and he retired from sports after failing to qualify for the Australian 1958 British Empire and Commonwealth Games team. O’Halloran returned to the family farm in Kojonup, taking over managing the farm from his father in the mid-1960s. In July 1976, O’Halloran’s body was discovered next to his rifle near a fence on his property. The investigation ruled the death accidental, as apparently O’Halloran had tripped as he climbed the fence and accidentally shot himself.","Listed in Olympians Who Set a World Record in Long Course Swimming (4×200 m freestyle relay – 3 December 1956 - 22 July 1959: 8:23.6 (3 December 1956; Melbourne, AUS))"

Richards has in fact played competitive rugby in four countries, quite unusual in his time. He started in his native Australia, playing for the Queensland representative team. After moving to South Africa with his family, he was selected for the Transvaal team. Moving to England, he played for Bristol and was selected for Glouchestershire. He then returned to Australia, again playing for Queensland. This position earned him a position in the Australian team that toured England in 1908, a trip that included the London Olympics. Scoring a try in the tournament’s only match against Cornwall, he took home the gold medal. In 1910, Richards was back in South Africa when the Lions were touring there. With much of the team injured, former Bristol player Richards was asked to help them out in a match against the host nation. After briefly playing for a French team in 1913, he volunteered for the Australian Imperial Force during World War I. He was at the original Gallipoli landing, fought on both the Eastern and Western front, and was awarded the Military Cross in 1917.

He also ran in the 3,000 metres team event where the United States beat the Finnish team in the first heat in what was described as a major upset.

At that time she was pregnant with her second child, and no one thought that she ever would be able to compete on horseback again. But through her determination and strong will she gradually regained function in most of her muscles, although she remained paralyzed below her knees for the rest of her life. In 1947 she started to compete in dressage again, and she improved her dressage skill together with her excellent horse Jubilee and was selected for the Danish team in the 1952 games. Although she needed help to get on and off her horse, she surprised everybody by winning the silver medal in the dressage competition in Helsinki. Four years later she won another dressage silver medal at the Equestrian Games in Stockholm, also this time together with her favorite horse Jubilee. She won the unofficial world championships in dressage in 1954, and was Danish champion in dressage in 1952, 1953, 1954, 1956 and 1959, the last time with a new horse, Limelight. Lis Hartel’s equestrian achievements caught interest among ordinary sport interested people in Scandinavia, where equestrian among many was regarded as an upper-class sport. She was a charming and charismatic woman, extremely popular not only among followers of equestrians, but also among people outside the horse circles. She also became a role model of other victims of polio, showing what was possible to achieve through training and determination. She was invited to do dressage exhibitions in several countries in Western Europe, and raised funds for treatment of polio victims. In Doorn in the Netherlands, a center for disabled was named after her, the Lis Hartel Foundation.",Listed in Olympians With a Disability (Paralyzed below her knees after struck by polio.)

He was the third of eight children, but only three of his siblings survived into adulthood. His older brothers died while part of the Canadian Indian residential school system, a tragedy that caused his family to move from Balcarres to Regina, Saskatchewan. It was there that he began playing hockey and, at a young age, he won the Eilers’ Medal, given annually to the player in the Regina Junior Hockey League who puts on the best display of sportsmanship. In addition to hockey, he also played baseball, lacrosse, rugby, and basketball. He eventually attended Campion and Regina Colleges on athletic scholarships and captained their hockey and rugby teams. He was a member of the 1929-1930 Regina Pats that won that year’s Memorial Cup, given to the Canada junior men’s ice hockey champions and scored the winning goal with 40 seconds left in the match. The following season he joined the Winnipeg Hockey Club and won that year’s Allan Cup, the senior-level version of the Memorial Cup, and was therefore invited to represent Canada at the following year’s Olympic ice hockey tournament. He played in one game, in the match against Poland, and scored one of Canada’s 10 goals in the shutout, helping his team win that year’s gold medal. The Olympics, however, were not the end of Moore’s career. He was a member of the Kimberley Dynamiters in 1936 when they won the Allan Cup and he was invited to tour with them for the 1937 World Championships. Before he could leave, however, he was dropped as a member of the team for unknown reasons. He then shifted to coaching, first the St. Boniface Athletics of the Manitoba Amateur Hockey Association, then the St. James Canadians. As a member of the 1931 Winnipegs, he was inducted into the Manitoba Sports Hall of Fame in 2004. As a member of the 1936 Dynamiters, he was inducted into the British Columbia Sports Hall of Fame in 1976. Despite being the first First Nations indivudal to both attend the Winter Olympics and win an Olympic gold medal in any sport, petitions from his descendants to induct Moore into Canada’s Sports Hall of Fame have, as of 2015, been unsuccessful. Renewed attention was given to his application, however, after Sharon and Shirley Firth were inducted into the Hall in 2015 and erroneously listed as the nation’s first indigenous Winter Olympians.",Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the World Ice Hockey Championships (1–0–0 1932 Lake Placid (Olympics) gold)

The 100-mile race set off from New Brighton in Merseyside and raced along Shropshire roads before finishing at Shawbury, near Shrewsbury. Marsh, who finished 12th in the first official UCI World Championship in Denmark the previous year, headed home a British 1-2-3 with Bill Burkill second and Charlie Davey third. Only one other Briton won the Amateur World Road Race title, and that was Graham Webb in 1967. Marsh appeared in just one more World Championship, in 1925, when he hoped to retain his title, but finished 25th, and more than half-an-hour behind the winner Libero Ferrario of Italy. Marsh’s only other performance of note was in breaking the 50-mile tandem record of 1-54:0 in 1921 with F. H. Dredge, who finished fifth behind Marsh at the 1922 World Championship.

Breckinridge won only one AFLA national individual championship, that in outdoor épée in 1924, but he was a member of nine national championship teams, while representing either the Washington Fencers Club or the New York Fencers Club. Breckinridge achieved prominence early in life. At 27 he was asked to join President Wilson’s first cabinet as the Assistant Secretary of War, and he served in that post from 1913 until 1916. He then fought in World War I, commanding a battalion and seeing action at Vosges, St. Mihiel, and the Meuse Argonne, leaving the service as a lieutenant colonel. Breckinridge, a Princeton grad who went on to Harvard Law, then took up the practice of law in New York. His most famous client was Charles Lindbergh and when Lindbergh’s infant son was kidnapped in 1932, Breckinridge, acting as both friend and counsel, was responsible for the conduct of the lengthy and futile ransom negotiations and the widespread attempts to make contact with the kidnapper. In 1934 Breckinridge ran for the U.S. Senate from New York but was defeated. In 1936 he entered several Democratic Presidential primaries, but with little success and he dropped out of contention for the nomination. He then returned to his law practice.",Brother of Scott Breckinridge

She was also an advocate of women’s rights and equal rights. Although she moved early in her life to New York, she frequently visited her family in Alabama and almost exclusively painted local motifs and portraits of African-Americans from the deep South. Goldthwaite studied in New York and went to Paris in 1906-13, where she joined the circle around Gertrude Stein (1874-1946) and explored new styles such as Cubism and Fauvism. She then opened a studio in New York but continued to search for motifs of her expressionist landscapes in the American South. She also produced murals and worked as a sculptor. From 1922 until her death, she taught at the Art Students League. More conservative than her paintings was her graphic oeuvre, which she also presented in Los Angeles in 1932. The work titled Polo I, is one of a series of at least two etchings showing scenes of the sport. It could not be confirmed whether this was her entry. The same applies to Skating in Central Park, which may correspond to Skaters. The Finish, however, could be identified and showed the finale of a horse race. At least the latter can also be found in a colored version. All etchings or prints were from the period 1922-24. The Finish is 10 x 12.5 cm in size somewhat smaller than the other two potential entries (15.1 x 17.5 cm).",

An outstanding junior career brought him Olympic selection for Barcelona 1992 at the age of eighteen and, after qualifying a lowly 20th in the qualifying round of the individual event, went on a run of upset victories that brought him an unexpected bronze medal. In partnership with Steven Hallard and Richard Priestman he repeated the feat in the team event. By the end of 1993 he had walked away disillusioned with the sport and the toll it had taken of his finances. Unemployed at the time of the Barcelona Games he had famously been refused government unemployment benefit for the time spent competing for his country. After 13 years away from the sport, and inspired by the thought of a home Olympics, he picked up his bow again in 2006 and on his return to international competition helped his national team to a silver medal at the Archery World Cup in Turkey. Selected for a second Olympic Games in 2008 he rose to a career high of second in the world rankings in mid-2009 when he won the individual silver medal at the World Cup. He won a second silver in the team event the following year, when it was held in Terry’s native Scotland, at Edinburgh.

Tysall, who was a gymnastics teacher by profession, also taught synchronised swimming to youngsters, despite being a non-swimmer himself. A life-long bachelor, Tysall was due to marry his fiancé, but she tragically died of tuberculosis shortly before they were due to get married. Tysall applied to join the Royal Engineers in World War I, but was declined on medical grounds, with it being recorded that he was not likely to become an efficient soldier.

The son of wealthy parents, he was supposed to become a physician. Zamora originally played the Basque game of pelota, but made his début as a goalkeeper in soccer at the age of 15 for the Real Club Deportivo Español Barcelona and in 1917-18 they became Champions of Catalonia.

In 1928 he earned his 26th cap in Spain’s 26th international match but as a professional he was unable to compete at the 1928 Olympics. In 1930-36 Zamora played for Real Madrid, becoming Spanish Champion 1931-32 and 1932-33 and was twice a Cup winner, in 1934 and 1936. At the 1934 World Cup he was injured in the quarter-finals and Spain lost the replay. In 1936 he played his 46th and final international match against Germany, including 24 as captain. Due to the Civil War in Spain Zamora went to France after having been briefly detained by the Republicans. Zamora was player-coach at Olympique Gymnaste Club de Nice in his last active season, 1938-39. At the end of the Civil War he returned to Spain and coached different clubs, and was twice Spanish Champion with Atletico Madrid (1939-40, 1940-41). In 1948 Zamora was technical director at Español Barcelona and coached the Spanish national team for two games in 1952. He later worked as a coach in Venezuela, returned in 1955 and was for some years engaged at Español Barcelona.

This was the beginning of a lengthy gymnastics career for Ghonaim, which culminated in multiple national and international accolades. Most notable among these were the six medals he earned at the 1959 Mediterranean Games: gold in the parallel bars and team all-around, silver in the floor exercises, horse vault, and rings, and bronze in the all-around. He then travelled to the 1960 Summer Olympics, where he was 15th with the team from Egypt (then known as the United Arab Republic due to its union with Syria) and had his best individual finish of joint-63rd in the horse vault. Ghonaim continued competing internationally for another two years, and was then recruited to star in a Russian-operated circus in Cairo, a position that he held until 1965. In 1967 he was then lured to Lebanon, where he was hired to build up the country’s national gymnastics program. Starting essentially from scratch, he developed a team that was competitive internationally, but had to leave in 1974 as the nation’s fifteen-year civil war loomed on the horizon. He was quickly snatched up by Saudi Arabia, who employed him through 1996 to establish a program in a country where gymnastics were practically unknown. By performing demonstrations during the halftime of football matches, he attracted enough attention to build a team that soon rose to be among the best in the Arab world. After his retirement, the Saudi government granted him the distinction of being the “founder of the sport of gymnastics in Saudi Arabia”.","Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the Mediterranean Games (2–3–1 1959 Beirut GYM gold: parallel bars and team, silver: floor, horse vault, and rings, bronze: all-around)"

He represented his school successfully in nation-wide tournaments and was introduced to the Kodokan in 1921. In 1923, he moved to Tokyo to attend the Tokyo Higher Normal School. The intensive training during this time earned him the necessary physical skills and technique and he competed in the Meiji Jingu Games for the first time. After graduating in 1927, Kotani was transferred as an assistant professor to Kumamoto Prefecture to teach judo. By this time, he had reached the 5th Dan and competed in a legendary tournament between the neighboring prefectures of Kumamoto and Fukuoka. In 1929, he joined the South Manchuria Railway and continued to teach judo there. He represented Manchuria in regional and national tournaments and acted as the director of the physical education section of the Manchurian government. While traveling to Europe and the US for his employer, he was asked to compete in wrestling at the 1932 Los Angeles Olympics. Because Japan was already represented in the lightweight class he had to move up to middleweight. However, he was the most successful Japanese wrestler in Los Angeles, losing only to the eventual medalists Ivar Johansson and József Tunyogi. He later accompanied Japan’s IOC member Jigoro Kano, promoting judo and Tokyo’s bid for the 1940 Olympics. After having received the 7th Dan from Kodokan he traveled various South American countries in 1939 as a judo instructor. After World War II Kotani returned to Japan and established the Osaka Judo Club. Serving in the Kodokan since 1949, he held important positions. In order to popularize his sport he frequently traveled to Europe, North America, and Asia. He also worked for the Japanese government and acted as Vice-Chairman and Advisor of the All Japan Judo Federation. In 1968, he was appointed a professor at Tokai University. At the age of 80, he received the 10th Dan during a ceremony on the Kodokan’s 100th anniversary to become the oldest holder of this rank.

In 1979 he was runner-up at the European Amateur Championship, losing the final against Viktor Demyanenko from the USSR. At the end of 1981 Weller turned professional and won the German pro title in the lightweight class. With a professional record of 51 wins (24 by KO), 1 loss, and 2 draws, he lost his only pro bout due to an injury against Danish non-Olympian Gerd Bo Jacobsen. In 1983 and 1988 Weller won the European lightweight title, but he fought mostly in Europe and never had a world title bout. Beside the boxing ring he was called “Der schöne René” (The beautiful René) and played some roles in minor successful German boxing movies like Macho Man and Ebbies Bluff. He also produced a belt and jewellery collection named “Rewell” and posed naked in several magazines. In 1999 he was sentenced to seven years imprisonment due to cocaine dealing, dealing in stolen goods and forgery, but was released in 2003. Weller took part in several trash TV formats in Germany like Big Brother, Promi Frauentausch (Exchange of prominent men/women), Das perfekte Promi-Dinner and others. He also started a minor successful career as a singer and entertainer. He also founded a boxing gym in his hometown Pforzheim. In 2014 he fell ill with dementia - also aggravated by his many hits to his head - and had to be cared for by his wife. He died in 2023 after a long illness.","Listed in Olympians Who Were Sent to Prison (In 1999 he was sentenced to seven years imprisonment due to cocaine dealing, dealing in stolen goods and forgery, but was released in 2003.)"

He played for České Sportovni in Bohemia prior to World War I. Playing the now defunct position of rover, he was known for his skating speed as a youth. After the war he returned to České Sportovni, until the club folded, and then joined ČKD Praha, playing with them from 1921-28. Hartman competed at the 1920 Olympics, winning a bronze medal, and at the 1923 and 1927 European Championships, also winning a bronze medal in 1923. An attorney by profession, he also worked as a sports journalist for many years and was a Vice-President of ČKD Praha. Hartmann also served as the Vice-President of the Ligue Internationale de Hockey sur Glace (LIHG) in 1922-23. Hartmann never practiced the Jewish religion and, as an accomplished singer, it was thought that his wish to sing in a church choir was the inspiration for him to convert to Catholicism rather than any religious revelation. The fact that he had converted to Christianity made no difference to the Nazi occupiers of Czechoslovakia and the entire family were deported to Theresienstadt concentration camp in July 1942. On October 16, 1944 they were moved to Auschwitz where he and his wife were probably put to death on the same day.

The firm follower of the Church of England published his first book of poems, called The Silver Stair, in 1912. In the following decades, he wrote and published untiringly anthologies, prefaces, reviews, poetry, plays (Thomas Cranmer of Canterbury), literary criticism, fiction (The Place of the Lion, Descent into Hell), biographies (Bacon, James I, Elizabeth I), and theological disputes. Romantic love and the coinherence of humans were to become the main foci of his work. By coining his own terminology, however, this made him somewhat difficult to read. With the outbreak of World War II, he had to follow the Oxford University Press from London to Oxford. In 1943, the Oxford University awarded him an honorary MA for his lectures. Williams was a member of the Fellowship of the Rosy Cross and - together with J. R. R. Tolkien – of the literary circle Inklings. He was also a close friend of C. S. Lewis, author of the Chronicles of Narnia. In his Williams biography The Third Inkling, Grevel Lindop reports that he submitted his Ceremonial Ode for the Opening of the Olympic Games without really knowing the procedures of the competition. Later, he received a diploma and a “bronze” medal, probably the participant’s medal. He was obviously not amused, when he found out that this was not really a unique award of appreciation.",

His victory at the Holmenkollen in ski jumping was the first by a non-Norwegian. For this he was awarded the Holmenkollen medal together with Lars Bergendahl and Trygve Brodahl, the first of only nine Swedes to receive this thru 2013. He was also honored in 1939 by the Swedish newspaper Svenska Dagbladet with a gold medal for his Holmenkollen victory. In alpine skiing, Eriksson/Selånger won the 1938 Swedish Championship. In Nordic combined he won three Swedish titles, winning eight ski jumping national championships between 1928-41. As early as the 1920s he was also a keen bandy player at home in Sundsvall.

He was encouraged to travel to London and, on the basis that in law all South African citizens were also British citizens, try for a place on the British Olympic team. He won the British title and was chosen for the 1948 Olympic Games in the lightweight category. At his best he might have been considered a medal contender but a bout of appendicitis ruined his chances and he placed outside the top ten. He also competed in bodybuilding and was 3rd in the 1948 Mr. Universe competition. Eland later became a coach for the British and Canadian weightlifting teams. He was a teacher for most of his working life and, after emigrating to Canada, obtained degrees in sociology and education from York University and the University of Toronto respectively.

81308,Sue Holloway,Female,19 May 1955,,, Canada,CAN,"From a young age, Sue Holloway’s ambition was to compete at both the Summer and Winter Olympics, a dream that she achieved in 1976, when she was only 21 years old. Her primary sport was canoeing and, having joined the national team in 1973, she had finished seventh in the K1-500 and the K2-500 at the 1974 World Championships, also failing to medal the following year. She was, however, the Canadian champion in the K1-500, the K2-500, and the K4-500 in 1975 and was selected to represent her nation at the 1976 Summer Olympics. Her first stop, however, was the Winter edition, where she placed 32nd in the 10 kilometer cross country race and 7th (alongside Joan Groothuysen, Sharon Firth, and Shirley Firth) in the 4 x 5 kilometer relay. At the Summer Games she was eliminated in the opening round of the K1-500 and finished eighth in the K2-500 with Anne Dodge. In the latter, Dodge was a last-minute replacement for the non-Olympian Karen Tippett, who had helped Holloway win four consecutive national championships in the K2-500. Holloway focused on canoeing after 1976, with the intent of making the 1980 Olympic team, but her hopes were shattered when Canada joined the boycott of these Games (although, prior to this announcement, she had been selected as the nation’s flag bearer in the Opening Ceremony). Refusing to give up hope, she continued to train and made Canada’s delegation to the 1984 Summer Olympics, where she captured bronze in the K4-500, alongside Alexandra Barré, Lucie Guay, and Barb Olmsted, and silver in the K2-500 with Barré. Holloway retired shortly after the Games and, with degrees in teaching and physical education from the University of British Columbia, Simon Fraser University, and George Brown College, she took up coaching, sports management, human resources, and motivational speaking. She also spent many years working with the Canadian Olympic Committee and has been inducted into the Canadian Olympic (1986), Ottawa Sports (1986), and Brookfield High School Sports (2008) Halls of Fame.",Wife of Greg Joy

As a young apprentice in a machine factory, he was adopted by the Li family and changed his name accordingly. Li joined the South China Athletic Association (SCAA) with the famous Li Huitang. He stayed with the team when most of the players left in 1926 and was promoted to become the A-team’s left-back. Two years later he moved to the right-back position. In 1930 he was one of the players who joined the Guangzhou Police on the China mainland opposite of Hong Kong. On the weekend Li continued to play for the SCAA, which dominated Hong Kong’s football for the next decade. For the national team, Li played in the 1930 and 1934 Far Eastern Games, winning both tournaments, and the 1936 Olympics. Even though he was considered the best defender in the first half of the 20th century, his shortness and, therefore, lack of heading ability, were clear disadvantages. When the system was changed in 1938, he was not able to adapt and his star began to decline. For the 1940-41 season Li left the SCAA to join the newly founded Sing Tao club. During this time, Li owned a rice shop and worked part time as a mechanic. After the fall of Hong Kong, in August 1942, he went to Shanghai to participate in the last season of the Western Division. After the war he returned to Hong Kong in 1947 and played one more season, at the age of 41, for Kowloon Motor Bus and subsequently retired. Li also worked as the stationmaster in Kowloon City for KMB before he retired in 1964. His son also became a decent football player.",

Snaffles specialized in water colors and drawings sold as prints which, at least initially, were hand colored by the artist and his sisters. His subject matter was invariably military, racing, hunting, and equestrian scenes. Many of his most famous pictures contrast military life with the peacetime pursuits of racing and hunting. Payne joined the Royal Garrison Artillery at the age of 18 as a gunner but in 1906 was forced to leave because of illness. However, his time in the Army was influential, as his first recorded works of semi-caricature date from this time. Invalided out of World War I, Payne took a job as a war artist for The Graphic and it was during these years that he produced some of his finest military work. His drawing is simply listed as County Galway in the catalog. One of his well-known drawings is titled The Sort for County Galway, published as a print around 1935. However, since Snaffles depicted scenes from Ireland quite frequently, particularly County Galway, and a number of his works were lost in the War, it is unclear whether his entry was really this drawing.",

He also designed articles of daily use such as lamps, bookends and radiator figures. In particular demand were his figures combining bronze and ivory. The bronze figures often have silvered, patinated or hammered surfaces. Stylistically, he is assigned to realism and Art Deco. He sometimes worked under the pseudonyms Marcel-André Derenne and Briand. Of the total of 13 entered bronze figures, several could be identified with great likelihood.

After winning gold and silver at the 1984 and 1986 European Junior Championships respectively, Duquçiyev made the Soviet national team in 1988. Duquçiyev, who wrestled in the Greco-Roman lightweight class most of his career, was considered the world’s best lightweight Greco-Roman wrestler in the early 1990s, although he never won the highest prize available, an Olympic gold medal. A World Champion in 1990-91 and European Champion in 1990, Duquçiyev went to the 1992 Olympics as the favorite for the Olympic Greco-Roman lightweight title, but an unexpected loss by decision in the gold medal match against Hungarian Attila Repka left him with silver. Representing Russia, Duquçiyev won the 1993 and 1994 World Championships and the 1993 European Championships, while taking bronze at the 1994 European Championships, but a serious cervical disc injury sustained during the 1995 World Championships prevented him from qualifying to the 1996 Olympics, leading Duquçiyev to retire from sports. He also won the World Cup in 1989 and was the Soviet Champion in 1988 and 1989. After his forced retirement, Duquçiyev worked as a wrestling coach, but staged a comeback to compete at the 2000 Olympics. He was not selected for the Russian team, but was invited by the Azerbaijani Wrestling Federation to compete under their flag. Duquçiyev finished sixth at his second appearance in the Olympic arena in the Greco-Roman lightweight division. He retired from wrestling again after the Olympics and resumed his work as a wrestling coach, being the head coach of Russian national Greco-Roman wrestling cadets team. He was elected to the FILA International Wrestling Hall of Fame in 2006.",

Improving steadily she recorded her first FIS World Cup top 10 finish in 1996 and in December 1997 in Park City, Utah, USA she posted her first victory which was the first World Cup victory by any Australian. Her form over the previous few races meant she was amongst the favourites for the Olympic slalom title and she did indeed become the first Australian to win an Olympic skiing medal placing third on Mount Yakebitai. The highlight of her career came in 1999 when she won the slalom at the World Championships in Vail, Colarado but her performances dipped in subsequent seasons and she retired after a disappointing 2002 Olympic Games.

Mancioli was a keen pilot and tennis player, so he was particularly interested in these two sports. In 1932 he presented two graphic works, Boxing, probably a charcoal drawing, and Hurdler from 1928.

He improved steadily over the next two years, but was unable to win any of the big senior championships, his best finish internationally being his silver at Grenoble. In 1969, however, Tim Wood reached the heights by winning both the U.S. and World Championships, both of which he would defend in the next year. With two years to go, he was now the top skater in the world, but he had had a long career and Sapporo seemed so far away. Wood decided to forego any more amateur competition and turned pro with the Ice Capades. After finishing his professional skating career, Wood went to graduate school in accounting with plans to enter the world of finance. In 1996 he formed a limited liability company (LLC), TLW Sports, planning to develop sports complexes as part of a healthy living / lifestyle community. Many investors ponied up money but that soon disappeared and no sports complex or lifestyle community ever appeared. In 2012 Wood filed for bankruptcy at US Bankruptcy Court in Santa Barbara, California. Multiple lawsuits were filed against Wood and TLW Sports, and the state of California suspended the LLC.",Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the World Figure Skating Championships (2–1–0 1968 Genève silver: singles; 1969 Colorado Springs gold: singles; 1970 Ljubljana gold: singles)

As a youngster, his track and field successes were restricted to school events. After Kingston, Sandstrom went to Hull University, and in 1951 was second in both the 100y and 220y at the Yorkshire Championships, behind the European champion Brian Shenton. Sandstrom also reached the 100 metres semi-final at the 1951 Summer International University Sports Week in Luxembourg. He failed to make much progress in the 1952 and 1953 seasons while he was studying physical education at Carnegie College, Leeds. After Carnegie, Sandstrom joined a physical fitness unit of the RAF in January 1954, and this helped develop his fitness. As a result, he won the Yorkshire and RAF 100 yard titles in 1954. He also played as wing three-quarter for the RAF rugby team. Sandstrom won the AAA 100y title in 1955, and was second in the 220, with the same time as winner George Ellis. Sandstrom also made the first of his 13 Great Britain international appearances that year. The following year, he was selected for the Melbourne Olympics and vindicated his selection before the Games when, on 19 August 1956, he broke the British 100 metre record with a time of 10.3, breaking the old record 10.4 set by Arthur Sweeney back in 1937. Sandstrom failed to retain his AAAs title before the Olympics, finishing third. Sandstrom’s final season was in 1958, and it ended on a high, when he was a member of the England team, with Peter Radford, David Segal and Adrian Breacker, that won the British Empire and Commonwealth Games 4 x 110 yards relay in a British record 40.72.

The high point of her career was probably at the 1998 Olympics, where she won golds in relay and 15 km classical style and silver in pursuit. At the World Championships, besides her 1995 medals, Danilova won relay golds in 1997, 1999 and 2001, four silvers (5 km classical and 30 km classical in 1999, 10 km classical and 30 km classical in 2001) and two bronzes (5 km classical in 1997 and in pursuit in 2001).

Danilova also competed at the 2002 Winter Olympics, where she was considered one of the favorites in classical events. After finishing first in pursuit and second in 10 km classical at the 2002 Olympics, Danilova was one of three cross-country skiers (together with Johann Mühlegg and Larisa Lazutina) who was disqualified after blood tests indicated the use of darbepoetin, a drug intended to boost red blood cell production. Danilova received a two-year ban, which also ended her competitive career, and was stripped of her 2002 medals. Although later, in 2005, it was proven that the blood test WADA used during the 2002 Olympics, was seriously flawed, resulting in many false positives, her 2002 standings were not reinstated by IOC.","Listed in Doping Irregularities at the Olympics (2002 Salt Lake City – 10 km. / Pursuit / 30 km.

McNeece grew up in Florida after his family moved from Nebraska. He played for the semi-pro Fort Lauderdale Tarpons, but retained his amateur status as the family worked out a deal whereby the Tarpons paid his father, and not Les. In 1935 McNeece was chosen to play with the USA on a Japanese tour, sponsored by General Foods and Wheaties. Shortly after his return from the Berlin Olympics he was signed by the Brooklyn Dodgers and was assigned to their farm club, the Louisville Colonels, turning down a basketball scholarship to LSU. In his first season he was hit in the head with a pitch, and in his second season, with Daytona Beach of the Florida State League, he broke his leg sliding into second, and his baseball career was over. McNeece settled in Fort Lauderdale, Florida where he married Wynona Gross. They started a dry cleaning business, Wynona’s Cleaners, and ran it for 40 years.",

4001,John McNally,Male,3 November 1932,175.0,54, Ireland,IRL,"John McNally started boxing as a youngster at the Immaculata club near to his home in the Pound Loney district of Belfast. Following a move to the St. Mary’s club, he won his first Ulster Juvenile title. Little did he know it at the time, but that was the first step towards him going on to make Irish boxing history because, when he won the bantamweight silver medal at the 1952 Helsinki Olympics, McNally became the first Irishman to win an Olympic boxing medal. In Helsinki, McNally reached the quarter-final where he came up against the experienced, and much fancied, Italian Vincenzo Dall’Osso, but the Irishman ran out the unanimous points winner. Dall’Osso had won the bantamweight title at the European Championships the previous year. After disposing of his Korean opponent in the semi-final, McNally then came up against the local favourite Pentti Hamalainen, who was searching for Finland’s first boxing gold medal of the Games. McNally did what he thought was enough to win the gold medal, particularly after the Finn had been cautioned at least eight times during the contest, but two of the three judges voted for the home favourite much to the Irishman’s disbelief. Nevertheless, McNally won silver, which was Ireland’s first Olympic medal in any sport since 1932. After he got over the bitter disappointment of the defeat in the Olympic final, McNally won a bronze medal at the 1953 European Championships, and represented Europe against the United Sates in the Golden Gloves in Chicago before turning professional in 1954. In his seven-year professional career McNally had 25 fights with a 14-9-2 record. He maintained that turning professional was the worst decision he made as he stopped enjoying the sport as he did when an amateur. After quitting the ring, McNally turned to his love of banjo playing and he toured Ireland and Europe in the 1970s with the popular folk band, The Freemen, of which he was a founder member. McNally was inducted into the Irish Boxing Hall of Fame in 2008.",

Having won both the 1983 European and World Championships, Mirzoyan was the favorite for the 1984 bantamweight gold, but missed the Olympics due to the Soviet boycott. After his great 1983 year, Mirzoyan was under the shadow of two great Bulgarian bantamweights Mitko Grablev and Neno Terziyski but, as Terziyski had a doping positive before the 1988 Olympics and Grablev during the 1988 Olympics, Mirzoyan won the 1988 Olympic gold despite being somewhat past his prime. His other medals at major international tournaments were bantamweight World Championships silvers in 1982 and 1985, bantamweight World Championships bronze in 1986 and featherweight bronze in 1987, and bantamweight European Championships silvers in 1982, 1985 and 1986. Mirzoyan was also the Soviet bantamweight champion in 1982-83, 1988 and 1991, taking silver in 1987 and bronze in 1990. Mirzoyan won the Soviet Cup in 1981, 1982 and 1985 and set 14 world records: four in the snatch, snatch in the clean & jerk, and four in the total. Mirzoyan finished his sporting career after the fall of the Soviet Union and began working as a weightlifting coach and sports official. From 1998-2004 he was president of the Armenian Weightlifting Federation as well as head coach of the Armenian national weightlifting team. In 2004 Mirzoyan became vice-president of the Armenian Olympic Committee and coached his son Arakel (2009 European lightweight champion) and nephew Araik Mirzoyan (2008 and 2009 European Junior lightweight champion) among others.",Father of Arakel Mirzoyan

84379,Ken Broderick,Male,16 February 1942,180.0,79, Canada,CAN,"Allowing five goals in two periods of play is not normally the sign of a promising new ice hockey goaltender, but although that was Kenneth “Ken” Broderick’s experience in the only game that he played during his first season with Toronto Marlboros of the Junior Ontario Hockey Association in 1958-1959, he went on to have a long and successful career in the sport. He left the Marlboros in 1961 to play one final season as a junior with the Metro Toronto Junior Hockey League’s Brampton 7-Ups prior to enrolling at the University of British Columbia and suiting up for one year with their hockey team, the Thunderbirds. In 1963 he decided instead to play with the Canadian men’s national ice hockey team, which had been founded that year, and accompanied them to the 1964 Winter Olympics. He minded the net for seven matches, but went home without a medal after the team lost to the Soviet Union in the final and the tiebreaking rules relegated them to fourth place. The rules for the World Championships were different, however, and Canada is credited with World Championship bronze that season. He played exclusively for Team Canada until 1968, with the exception of several games for the Vancouver Canucks of the Western Hockey League and the Hull Nationals of the Quebec Senior Hockey League, and collected bronze medals from the 1966 and 1967 World Championships, as well as the 1968 Winter Olympics. At the latter tournament he minded the net for five games and was named the best goaltender of the event. The Toronto Maple Leafs of the National Hockey League picked up Broderick in 1967, but they sold him to the league’s Minnesota North Stars that year and, after some time with the Western Hockey League’s Phoenix Roadrunners and the Central Professional Hockey League from 1968 through 1970, he suited up for his first NHL games with the team during the 1969-1970 season. After only seven games, however, he was back in Canada with the Senior Ontario’s Hockey League’s Oakville Oaks and Galt Hornets. His next stop was two years with the San Diego Gulls of the Western Hockey League and, in 1973, he won the Leading Goaltender Award and the Leader Cup as league MVP. His success paved the way for a busy 1973-1974 season, as he played with the Gulls, the Boston Bruins of the NHL, and the Boston Braves of the American Hockey League. The following season was no less busy, split between the Bruins, the Rochester Americans of the AHL, and the Binghamton Dusters of the short-lived North American Hockey League. It would be his last stint in the NHL, as he spent the following year with the Americans and, from 1976 until his 1978 retirement, he was signed with the Edmonton Oilers and the Quebec Nordiques when they were part of the Western Hockey Association. Later Broderick spent his time volunteering for charitable organizations and remained athletically active by playing golf. His older brother Len was also a goaltender and played one game in the NHL with the Montreal Canadiens.",Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the World Ice Hockey Championships (0–0–2 1966 Ljubljana bronze; 1968 Grenoble (Olympics) bronze)

The stadium is considered the cradle of Colombian football and was declared a National Monument in 1995. Molther then worked in Ancon, Panama for 17 years serving in the Engineering Division of the Panama Canal as architect designer and structural engineer.

Italy’s best junior of his day, Ottoz started hurdling in 1964, ranking third behind seniors Giovanni Cornacchia and Giorgio Mazza. He ran 13.9 in Berlin that year, the first of a long series of Italian records (19 in total) in the 110 metre hurdles. At the 1964 Olympic Games in Tokyo, Ottoz placed fourth, leading home two other Italian hurdlers, Giovanni Cornacchia in seventh and Giorgio Mazza in eighth place, both in 14.1. Considered a top technician, in 1965, he lowered his personal best time to 13.6, defeating the silver medallist from Tokyo 1964, Blaine Lindgren, and then winning the Summer Universiade in Budapest, beating the world number one, American Willie Davenport. In the following season Ottoz obtained the first of his three consecutive wins at the European Indoor Championships in the 60 metre and 50 metre hurdles; dominated the continental championship in Budapest in the summer (winning in 13.7 ahead of the German Hinrich John and the Frenchman Marcel Duriez); and ended the season undefeated, with the exception of a race where he crashed while in the lead ahead of Davenport. In the winter of 1967, Ottoz set three personal best world indoor performances and went on tour in the United States. Outdoors he dropped his personal best to 13.5 and remained clearly the best hurdler in Europe. Ottoz then lost to Davenport during the Italy-USA-Spain match in Viareggio, as well as in the America vs. Europe dual meet at Montréal where Ottoz captured the bronze medal in 13.46 behind Americans Davenport (13.33) and Ervin Hall (13.42). It was 26 years before the Italian national high hurdles record was broken – by his son Laurent Ottoz who ran 13.42 in Berlin on 30 August 1994. In his last competitive season in 1969, Ottoz trained less but stayed in good shape, managing to run 13.5 at the European Championships where he beat the 400 metre hurdles champion Dave Hemery of Britain.

He created a connection between the symbol of the city Berlin, the Brandenburg Gate and the symbol of the Olympic Games, the five intertwined rings. The design for the visitor badge was also designed by Raemisch, who again used the symbols of Berlin and the Olympics for this, but in the reverse order as the Olympic badges. The same badge in enlarged form was a car-use plaque that went on sale in a limited extent. The official bronze medal for the 9th IOC congress in Berlin 1930 came in the size 9.5 x 8.9 cm with a weight of 245 grams.

After an injury ruined season in 1985 she returned to competition and won four medals (1 gold, 2 silver, 1 bronze) at the Commonwealth Games which would be the last major championship of her career.

63904,Jim Thompson,Male,21 March 1906,,, United States,USA,"Jim Thompson’s Olympic sailing career was but a footnote to an exotic, mysterious life. He was born to wealth in Delaware, and studied at St. Paul’s School in New Hampshire and Princeton. He later studied architecture at the University of Pennsylvania and practiced architecture in New York in the 1930s. His politics in the late 30s became rather liberal, alienating him from his family and he joined the US Army in 1940. During World War II Thompson served with the Office of Strategic Services (OSS), using his fluency in French to help fight with the French resistance movement, and with the French in North Africa. Shortly after the end of the war, he was transferred to the OSS Bangkok Office. He returned to the USA after leaving the Army in 1946 and tried to get his wife to join him in Thailand, but she refused and they divorced. But Thompson returned to Bangkok on his own. He started a large syndicate that renovated the Oriental Hotel, turning it into one of the world’s best known hotels. Although officially no longer in intelligence services, there are suspicions that he continued to work undercover for the CIA while in Thailand. Thompson’s main effort in Bangkok was re-establishing the Thai silk industry. He organized a group of investors to form the Thai Silk Company and hired local weavers to renovate what had been a dying industry in Thailand. Thompson became a wealthy man in Thailand, but also made many of the weavers rich as well, giving them shares of the company. He used his wealth to collect Southeast Asian Art, and had an envied collection of Buddhist and secular art from Thailand, Burma, Cambodia, and Laos. In 1958, Thompson used his architectural skills to build his dream home, which was formed from parts of six antique Thai houses, and sat on a canal across from Bangkrua, where his weavers worked. The home, now called The Jim Thompson House, became the second most popular tourist attraction in Bangkok, surpassed only by the Grand Palace. On Easter Sunday, 26 March 1967, Thompson was staying in Pahang, Malaysia, in the Cameron Highlands while on a holiday with friends. He went for a walk that afternoon and was never seen again. His disappearance remains a puzzle, despite extensive efforts to discover the reasons behind it, and several books have been written about Thompson’s life and its mysterious end.",

She flew airplanes with him as his co-pilot, and wrote more than 10 books of memories, fiction, poetry and essays. In 1932 the world was shocked by the “Lindbergh kidnapping” of their baby Charles Augustus, Jr. by Bruno Richard Hauptmann, who was later sentenced to death for this crime. Only one year after the kidnapping, Charles and Anne Lindbergh succeeded in 1933 in becoming the first to fly the North Atlantic and South Atlantic route. They also became the first to fly from Africa to South America, and explored polar air routes from North America to Asia and Europe. Anne Lindbergh’s writings reflected her views of the role women should play in the world. Her 1956 book, Gift from the Sea, topped the best-seller list for months and continued to sell steadily through the coming decades. In the book, she presented eight inspirational essays concerning the meaning of a woman’s life. Her most controversial published work was her 1940 book The Wave of the Future, in which she appeared to share her husband’s favorable opinions regarding Nazi Germany. Anne Lindbergh has been inducted into the National Women’s Hall of Fame and the National Aviation Hall of Fame. Her 1936 entry, the book North to the Orient, was published in 1935 and describes her flight from the US via the North Route to the Far East across Canada, Alaska and Siberia in 1931.
