Gregory appeared in his second Olympic sprint relay final in 1952, finishing fourth.

He played professional Rugby League for a brief spell after that, which resulted him being banned from playing the Union code until the start of the 1948-49 season, when he re-joined Blackheath.

Throughout his life Antal remained attached to the mountains – especially the Alps – where he hiked and climbed again and again. Antal studied from 1925 first at a School of Arts and Crafts and then at the Academy of Fine Arts in Budapest. From 1931 he worked as an assistant in the studio of Béla Ohmann (1890–1968), who significantly influenced the style of the neoclassical Roman School. Antal made study trips to Italy while on scholarship (1934/35), as well as to Austria, Germany, Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria, and Romania. From 1935 he lived and worked in an artists’ colony in Budapest. From 1950-59 he was a teacher in stone restoration at the Academy of Fine Arts. Antal regularly participated in exhibitions from 1932 on. His favorite subject was the human figure with a preference for monumentality, including works for the Fisherman’s Bastion in Budapest. In his later sculptures the realistic and neoclassical tendencies prevailed, which allowed him to continue his career under the socialist regime. In 1945 he created the first Soviet heroic monuments. Beginning in the 1950s, Antal was regularly commissioned to create sculptures for public spaces and to restore buildings. In the early 1970s, he went to the Kemenesalja region and produced more than 30 works for local villages. Antal was also the secretary of the Hungarian Workers’ Tourist Association. In the years before his death, he was awarded the Order of Merit of the Republic of Hungary and the Kossuth Prize. In 1952 in Helsinki he exhibited his plaster sculpture Ice Hockey Player.",

49321,Willy den Ouden,Female,1 January 1918,,, Netherlands,NED,"The talents of Willy den Ouden were discovered in 1930, when she was still a junior. She won her first Dutch title the next year, still only aged 13. At the European Championships later that year, she claimed a silver medal in the 100 m freestyle, and helped the Dutch relay team earn a gold medal. A year later, Den Ouden added two Olympic silver medals to her prize cabinet, again in the 100 m freestyle and 4 x 100 m freestyle. In 1933, Den Ouden broke her first World Record, setting a 2:28.6 mark in the 200 m freestyle. She would eventually set 15 World Records, although this included some distances no longer recognized. Her 100 m mark set on 27 February 1936, 1:04.6, would remain a World Record for almost 20 years, as it was only broken by Dawn Fraser on 21 February 1956. Den Ouden was one of the stars of the 1934 European Championships, earning gold in the 100 m freestyle and the 4 x 100 m relay. The 400 m ended in a dead heat with compatriot Rie Mastenbroek. As Den Ouden refused a re-swim to break the tie, she was handed only a silver medal. By the time of Den Ouden’s second Olympics, Berlin 1936, she had been eclipsed by Mastenbroek, who won the 100 m freestyle final while Den Ouden finished fourth. They did combine to earn a gold medal in the relay, however. At her last major event, the 1938 European Championships, Willy den Ouden won her ninth and final international medal: a silver in the relay. Ending her career with five Dutch titles (100 m freestyle, 1931-35), Den Ouden fled abroad at the outbreak of World Ward II. Marrying a Swedish shipping manager, she moved to Saltsjöbaden, but returned to Rotterdam upon their separation. Little is known of her life after that, except that she married (and divorced) twice more, and worked in a fur shop.","Listed in Olympians Who Set a European Record in Long Course Swimming (100 m freestyle – 7 August 1932 - 3 March 1956: 1:07.6 (7 August 1932; Los Angeles, USA), 1:06.0 (9 July 1933; Antwerpen, BEL), 1:05.4 (24 February 1934; Amsterdam, NED), 1:04.8 (15 April 1934; Rotterdam, GBR), 1:04.6 (27 February 1936; Amsterdam, NED); 200 m freestyle – 3 May 1933 - 26 February 1938: 2:28.6 (3 May 1933; Dundee, GBR), 2:27.6 (5 May 1934; Rotterdam, NED), 2:25.3 (8 September 1935; København, DEN); 400 m freestyle – 12 July 1934 - 10 February 1937: 5:16.0 (12 July 1934; Rotterdam, NED); 4×100 m freestyle relay – 12 August 1932 - 8 February 1938: 4:47.5 (12 August 1932; Los Angeles, USA), 4:43.0 (12 November 1933; Amsterdam, NED), 4:41.2 (28 March 1934; Rotterdam, NED), 4:33.3 (14 April 1934; Rotterdam, NED), 4:32.8 (24 May 1936; Rotterdam, NED)) Listed in Olympians Who Set a World Record in Long Course Swimming (100 m freestyle – 9 July 1933 - 21 February 1956: 1:06.0 (9 July 1933; Antwerpen, BEL), 1:05.4 (24 February 1934; Amsterdam, NED), 1:04.8 (15 April 1934; Rotterdam, NED), 1:04.6 (27 February 1936; Amsterdam, NED); 200 m freestyle – 3 May 1933 - 26 February 1938: 2:28.6 (3 May 1933; Rotterdam, NED), 2:27.6 (5 May 1934; Dundee, GBR), 2:25.3 (8 September 1935; København, DEN); 400 m freestyle – 12 July 1934 - 10 February 1937: 5:16.0 (12 July 1934; Rotterdam, NED); 4×100 m freestyle relay – 14 April 1934 - 8 February 1938: 4:33.3 (14 April 1934; Rotterdam, NED), 4:32.8 (24 May 1936; Rotterdam, NED)) Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the European Aquatics Championships (3–3–0 1931 Paris SWM gold: 4×100 m freestyle relay, silver: 100 m freestyle; 1934 Magdeburg SWM gold: 100 m freestyle and 4×100 m freestyle relay, silver: 400 m freestyle; 1938 London SWM silver: 4×100 m freestyle relay)"

13661,Jackie Bone,Male,17 September 1914,173.0,56, Great Britain,GBR,"The son of a disabled ex-serviceman, Jackie Bone started riding a bicycle when he got a job as a delivery boy for a local shopkeeper in his home-town of Milngavie in Scotland. He took up racing seriously at the age of 19, and in March 1934 won his first race, a Novices 25-mile race, which he won with the fastest time of the year by a novice. Just over two years later Bone was competing in the Olympic Games. A virtual unknown the previous year, Bone hit the headlines in 1935 when he won the West of Scotland 12-hour time trial with a Scottish and British record of just over 244 miles (393 km) but, more significantly, he was the first man in Scotland to cover 12 hours at an average of 20 mph. Bone was also the Scottish Best All-rounder for 1935, when he covered the requisite 50-mile, 100-mile, and 12-hour events in a combined average speed of 21.561 mph. He was also the Scottish road race champion that year. Bone twice had podium finishes in the Manx International on the Isle of Man, finishing third in 1936, and second in 1937. He took part in the Olympic road race at Berlin in the first of those years, but without success. In 1938, Bone came closest to his only National title when he finished third in the NCU Road Race Championship at Donington Park. He also took part in the World Championships that year. However, Bone’s greatest success was probably in June 1937, when he beat fellow Olympian Alick Bevan by nearly three minutes in the 17½-mile Sunday Pictorial race at Alexandra Palace.

He spent a few years working as a bouncer in Montréal, but then turned professional and became best known as “Mad Dog” Vachon. To succeed professionally, Vachon bulked up, shaved his head, grew a goatee, and became known as a reckless rule breaker. Vachon would use foreign objects, filed fingernails, his teeth, and a punishing finishing move, the Piledriver, all of which made him notorious and caused him to be banned in three US states. It also made him very popular, however, among the fans of pro wrestling. In 1961 Vachon was recruited to the American Wrestling Alliance (AWA) by Vern Gagne, who he had met at the 1948 Olympics in London, where Gagne was an alternate for the US. In 1964 Vachon upset Gagne to win the AWA heavyweight title, although Gagne quickly regained it. Between 1964-67, however, Vachon won the AWA title five times, usually losing it rather quickly. In 1968 he returned to Montréal, where he wrestled for the International Wrestling Association (IWA), winning that title, before returning to the AWA in 1969. In the late 1970s he turned more to tag team matches, eventually teaming up with his old nemesis, Gagne, and they held the AWA tag team championship for one year, before losing it to Jesse Ventura and Adrian Adonis. Vachon continued to wrestle into the 1980s, joining the Worldwide Wrestling Federation (WWF) in 1984. He retired from competition in 1986, with a retirement show in Montréal, after 30 years as one of the most beloved villains in professional wrestling. He and his wife later settled in and near Omaha, Nebraska, where Vachon lost a leg when he was struck by a car while jogging.

Previously this move, which entails the man pivoting with one toe on the ice while the woman circles him with her body almost parallel to the ice, had been performed professionally with two hands, and thus the female was not lowered entirely to the ice. The pair had also taken the same medal at the 1948 World Championships. He and Morrow were the North American pairs champions in 1947, and the Canadian champions in 1947 and 1948. Diestelmeyer also had a previous pairs title with the non-Olympian Joyce Perkins in 1946. He also competed occasionally in singles events, but did not perform remarkably at the international level, placing 9th at the 1948 World Championships and 12th at that year’s Olympic Games.

He initially studied in Liège, then later in Paris at the Academie des Beaux-Arts and the Academie Julian. He was later appointed professor in Liège. Daxhalet painted figurative and expressionistic works, but was also a big sports fan, and was a boxer himself. He traveled several times to Africa but also to India, the Middle East, South America, and Polynesia. Influenced by these experiences, he turned to Oriental scenes and surrealism in the 1960s. The works submitted in 1936 cannot be precisely identified, as Daxhelet created numerous works showing boxing and wrestling scenes using different techniques. The corresponding techniques are not listed in the catalogue, nor are the times of origin known for most of these works. These were mainly charcoal drawings and watercolors, but also including ink drawings and an oil painting. According to the catalogue, the works entered in 1948 were paintings. An oil painting of 60 x 79 cm titled “Fotbol” was created as early as 1925, but there seems to be more than one picture with this subject that could be considered.",

There he founded the artist group Vita Nova. At first he was close to verismo and made small sculptures and portraits. He was professor for plastic figures at the Academy of Fine Arts of Carrara from 1915-29, mostly executing classicist head-high sculptures and big monuments, such as the monument to the fallen of the First World War in Tivoli, and a marble and bronze monument to the fallen in the Piazza Matteotti in Sarzana. In addition, he also worked as a medalist, draftsman and art critic. In 1908 he won the competition for what would be his most famous work, a colossal group, the Quadriga of Unity, to be realized in bronze, designed to crown the porch of the national monument for King Viktor Emmanuel II in Roma, the analogous counterpart to Quadriga of Freedom by Paolo Bartolini. The work engaged Fontana for 20 years, and was only installed in 1928, the year he took part in the Olympic Art Competition “hors concours”. The building was designed by Giuseppe Sacconi.",

Dickey played in college at the University of Tennessee. He had been drafted in the 10th round of the 1993 Major League Baseball draft but did not sign, instead playing with the Volunteers for three seasons. In 1996 was again drafted in the MLB draft, this time in the first round by the Texas Rangers. Dickey had a long MLB career, playing from 2001-17, after starting out in the minors for a few seasons. He was not a power pitcher, relying on a forkball and later in his career a knuckleball, but he was effective. Dickey played for the Rangers from 2001-06, but later bounced around a bit. He played for the Seattle Mariners (2008), Minnesota Twins (2009), New York Mets (2010-12), Toronto Blue Jays (2013-16), and finished up with the Atlanta Braves in 2017. Dickey’s best year by far was 2012 when he won the NL Cy Young Award, led the National League in strikeouts, and made the All-Star team. That year he threw two consecutive one-hitters, striking out 12 or more in both games, becoming only the third MLB pitcher, after Sandy Koufax and Nolan Ryan, to do that in one season, but the only pitcher in Major League history to do that consecutively. He also had a streak of 32 2/3 scoreless innings in 2012. R. A. Dickey was a studious type who had majored in English literature at Tennessee, read voluminously, and said if he had not played major league ball, he would have wanted to be an English professor. In the off-season between 2011-12 he climbed Mount Kilimanjaro as a charitable effort, raising moneys for victims of human trafficking in India, a charity named the Bombay Teen Challenge. He also started the Honoring the Father Ministries in Florida that brings medical supplies, food, and baseball equipment to impoverished Latin American children.",

Despite the handicap of a late start in the sport he moved quickly through the ranks of the middleweight division to become British champion and in 1971 won a bronze medal at the World Championships. Starbrook originally planned to compete at the Munich Olympics as a middleweight but failed to make the weight at the preceding European Championship and opted to move to the 93 kg class instead. Starbrook had defeated [Shota Chochishvili] in the early rounds in Munich but the Soviet came back into the competition via the repechage and when the two men fought again in the final it was Chochishvili who had the upper hand. The Briton was runner-up at the European Championship in 1973 and won another world bronze the same year.

Before the outbreak of World War I he had won many local and county swimming honours. Having finished third in the Southern Counties 100 yards and 220 yards freestyle in 1911, both races being won by Rob Derbyshire, Hunt competed in the 100 yards at the ASA Championships at Brighton that year. The following year, he came close to Olympic selection after three excellent performances in the 100 and 200 metres at the trials at Southport, Hyde and Tooting. Unfortunately he did not get on the team for the Stockholm Games. Having played for Middlesex in the 1913 County Water Polo final, Hunt decided to concentrate more on polo after World War I. An inspector in the City of London police, he was the mainstay of their water polo team and made his international début for England in 1921. He had the honour of captaining the side against Ireland at Belfast in 1922. Hunt’s most memorable season was in 1924 when, not only did he appear at the Olympic Games, but he was also Great Britain’s flagbearer at the Opening Ceremony. A couple of months after the Games Hunt helped the City of London police team win both the London Senior Water Polo and Middlesex County Championship titles. He also played his last International that year and would then serve on the committee of the Surrey County Water Polo Association, becoming president in 1929. During World War II, Hunt was bombed out of his house and moved to Bridgewater in Somerset, where he remained for the rest for his life.",

The following day a “consolation” event was held, which Horton won at 11-3¾ (3.45) with Dvorak second at 11-1¾ (3.39). Four years later in St. Louis, under more organized circumstances, Dvorak won the gold medal with a new Olympic record of 11-6 (3.50) and had three failures at a new world record height of 12-2 (3.71).

Together with other proponents of the “English” variant of the game, he managed to make the switch and the first international game was played in 1926, against Belgium. The switch worked out great, and De Waal captained the Dutch to a silver medal at the 1928 Olympics, and later a bronze in 1936. After the war, he became head coach of the Dutch national team.

Reynolds first studied shipbuilding at Cornell University, then marine painting in Long Island. He was an impressionist and his brother encouraged him to study in Europe. Their father was the landscape painter William Reynolds Beal (1838-1912), while their niece, Marjorie Acker, was also a famous painter, who was married to the renowned art critic and collector, Duncan Phillips (1886-1966). Reynolds studied in Madrid and his love of the sea brought him to predominantly maritime motifs. He lived in Rockport, Massachusetts and painted mainly scenes from the Caribbean, Central America, Portugal, and the U.S. West Coast. All his three submitted works were etchings. Marblehead - Yachts Racing was a 20 x 30 cm drypoint etching from 1929. His second entry was Fisherman’s Race – The “Henry Ford”. The Henry Ford was launched in 1922 and competed in the International Fisherman’s Race that year but lost to the legendary Canadian yacht “Bluenose”. It did, however, win an All-American Fisherman’s Race in 1923 off Gloucester, Massachusetts. The ship sank off Rocky Harbor, Newfoundland in 1928. There is an etching titled Gloucester Fisherman’s Races – Henry Ford (1928, 20 x 33 cm), probably the work presented in 1932. Becalmed – Marblehead was also from 1929 and was also a 20 x 30 cm etching.",Brother of Gifford Beal Uncle of Marjorie Phillips

He was raised in Taipei before returning to Japan. There, he attended the Kagoshima Higher Agriculture and Forestry School and joined the local judo and sumo clubs. During his third year at Kagoshima he won a martial arts contest in Kyoto and was promoted to 2nd Dan of Kōdōkan. After graduation, he advanced three further Dans in Tokyo. Later, he enrolled in the Department of Agriculture at Penn State University and majored in horticulture. During this time, he discovered the Western style of wrestling. Naito became the national student champion and was nicknamed “Tiger Naito”. According to US immigration law in force, he was not allowed to represent the United States in international competitions. Probably on advice of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, he was included on the Japanese Olympic team to reduce the political friction between Japan and the United States. Although he was never defeated before by the two Americans Robin Reed and Chet Newton, he had to settle for the bronze medal due to a hand injury acquired during the passage to Europe. After the Olympics, Naito returned to Japan and introduced wrestling at the Kōdōkan for the first time, but wrestling in Japan was only fully established in 1929. Naito moved to Taiwan again, working for a sugar company, before emigrating to Brazil in 1928. In São Paulo, he became one of the founders of the first organization promoting judo and kendo. Although it was closed when Japan was at war with Brazil, it was revived in 1948 and he later became chairman of the Judo Federation. In 1964, Naito was invited by the Japanese Wrestling Association to visit the 1964 Tokyo Olympics. In 1969, he received the Kōdōkan’s 7th Dan.

He was selected for the 1924 Paris Olympics after winning two road race trials. Ten days after the Games, Pilcher took part in the World Road Race Championships, also in France, and was the highest placed British rider in 10th place, albeit nearly 28 minutes behind the French winner André Leducq. Also in 1924, Pilcher had three memorable second placings. He was runner-up in the Polytechnic 100-mile Championship (the week after the Worlds), and also came second in the prestigious Anfield “100” and in the North Road Club’s 24-hour race, when covering a distance of 373 miles (600.3km) in wet and windy conditions. Pilcher took to tandem racing in 1925, partnering R F Wells, and two years later won the Southern Roads 50-mile tandem handicap with a new partner, fellow Poly rider W Effner. Also in 1927, Pilcher finished second in the tandem-paced Marlboro “100” at Herne Hill, despite being 10 laps behind after 75 miles. He made up ground and was beaten at the line by yards. The first tandem-paced 24-hour track race in Britain since 1910 took place at Herne Hill in June 1927 and Pilcher was one of the fancied riders.

51217,Jenny Thompson,Female,26 February 1973,177.0,69, United States,USA,"With 12 medals and eight gold medals, Jenny Thompson has won more swimming medals and gold medals than any woman in Olympic history. But all eight of her gold medals came in relays, and this immensely talented swimmer was frustrated in her attempt to win an individual Olympic gold medal. Her only individual medals were a silver in the 1992 100 freestyle and a bronze in the same event in 2000. While attending Columbia Medical School, Thompson came out of retirement and made the 2004 Olympic team, and won two relay silver medals in Athens. Twenty-three times a national champion, she was more successful individually at the World Championships, winning the 100 free and 100 fly at the 1998 worlds. At the other major international event, the Pan-Pacifics, Thompson also won the 50 free four times (1989, 1991, 1993, 1999), the 100 free four times (1993-99), and the 100 fly three times (1993, 1997-1999). Among all female Olympians, Thompson’s eight gold medals are surpassed only by Larysa Latynina’s nine in gymnastics, and equaled by Birgit Fischer-Schmidt in canoeing.

He was educated as an architect at the Academy of Fine Arts in St. Petersburg from 1886-94 and then traveled in Italy and Greece on a scholarship. After rejecting a proposal to take the chair for architecture at the Warsaw Technical University, he lived in Moskva until 1918. There he worked as a curator and lecturer at the Museum of Industrial Art. In 1906, he was appointed professor at the Moscow School of Painting, Sculpture and Architecture. After the October Revolution, Noakowski became a member of the Council of Performing Arts of the People’s Commissariat for National Education but returned to Warszawa before the end of 1918 to become an architecture professor at Polytechnical University, and for some time held the post of a dean. As a draftsman and watercolorist he mainly produced large cycles of architectural drawings depicting Old Russian architecture, French palaces, classic antique architecture, and buildings and art treasures destroyed in World War I in Poland. During his lectures Noakowski drew pictures with chalk on the blackboard, of which only a few have survived. He died in 1928, the year of the Amsterdam Olympics. At the 1928 Amsterdam Olympics Noakowski participated in the Art Competitions in the category Drawing and Water Colors with a series of 18 drawings under the title Free Architectural Designs of a Painter. Most of them, except for the tournament drawings, came from the cycles Olimpiada I (1924, created in connection with the Olympic Games in Paris) and Olimpiada II (1928, in connection with the Amsterdam Olympics). Like his other drawings, Noakowski produced them in ink and sepia. Many of these works are now in the National Museum in Warsaw. The formats are about 48 x 52-62 cm.",

920023,Edwin Grienauer,Male,7 March 1893,,, Austria,AUT,"Austrian Edwin Grienauer was the son of cellist Karl Grienauer (1868-1915) and opera singer Helene Schott (1871-1910) but grew up temporarily in an orphanage. After an apprenticeship he studied at the School of Applied Arts in Wien (Vienna). From 1912 he worked as a freelancer, but from 1920-33 he was a member of the Künstlerhaus. He was known primarily for his design of official Austrian and Liechtenstein coins. He was also an outstanding rower, winning the 1927 Austrian Championships in double sculls. He created large sculptures, busts, medals and coins, was awarded the title of an honorary professor in 1935 and taught from 1945 at the Academy of Fine Arts in Wien. His large-scale sculptures and architectural decorations can be found particularly in the Wien area. Grienauer also created numerous medals and plaques on sports topics, including the 50 Schilling coin on the occasion of the Olympic Winter Games in Innsbruck 1964. In 1928 Grienauer submitted four medals to the art competitions in the category Medals and Reliefs, one of them winning the gold medal. Two of the medals were created for a concrete reason. One medal was created for the award ceremony in rowing in Wien (three-cities-eights-rowing Berlin-Vienna-Budapest) on 27 June 1927, in which Nike presents three athletes an olive branch. Another medal 60th anniversary was also dedicated to the rowing club Donauhort (1927). In the background, a coxed eight can be seen, and in the foreground an athlete (the winner) is waving a flag. Both medals were one-sided and had a diameter of 60 mm. The third medal showed a naked athlete and the inscription “Kunsthistorisches Museum”. It was a model of a badge for museum guides (60 x 37 mm) created in the Olympic year. The fourth medal was a work from 1926 for the Künstlerhaus. It is a one-sided AE-medal with a diameter of 70 mm as an annual premium of the Medailleurs’ Association of the Cooperative of the Fine Arts in Wien titled “Dragon fight”. Grienauer’s medals were listed in the catalog under three categories, each with the neutral designation “medal”. However, four medals are shown in the Official Report. Possibly the badge, which was only created in 1928, was subsequently submitted. Whether the gold medal was awarded in 1928 for his overall presentation or only for one of the works is still unclear. In 1932 he took part with eight works and in 1948 he earned another Olympic bronze medal for his Prize Rowing Trophy. In 1932 Grienauer submitted 8 medals in a frame with glass: Medal of the Austrian Automobile Club (1930, prize medal, one-sided, 60 mm), Eckart-Bund medal (1929, one-sided, 60 mm), Nike (pentathlon medal) (1931 for the Austrian Federation of Physical Sport, winner’s medal, 50 mm), Neptune (watersport medal) (1929, one-sided, 50 mm, 48 g), Sprinter in the final spurt (1928), European Championship Medal in Women’s Figure Skating (1929 for the International Skating Federation, prize medal, 40 mm), Badge for Certified Ski Instructor (1928, one-sided, octagonal, 40 mm), and Rowers (sports medal) (1929, one-sided, 35 mm). With the bronze medal in 1948 for his Plaque for Rowing, he was one of the very few Olympians who won more than one art medal. In the same year he also participated in the painting category. In 1952 Grienauer once again exhibited a collection of bronze medals. In 1950, a medal was created with a Mercury running left on the obverse and three naked men pulling a rope to the left on the dedication side. It was awarded as a premium medal “for loyal service” by the Chamber of Commerce in Wien in large numbers over the years. The bronze medal had a diameter of 50 mm with a weight of 49 g. A one-sided pewter plaque showed a torch runner in front of the coat of arms of the City of Wien. It was awarded by the city for “For Services to Sport”. The diameter was 59.8 mm, the weight 46.2 g. However, it is impossible to prove whether these were among those issued in Helsinki.",

He primarily was a cross country skier, winning three Austrian titles and taking part in the 1936 Winter Olympics, where he placed 8th as the starter of the Austrian 4 × 10 km relay team. The following year, he was the first person ever to cross the Caucasus on skis, and together with Friedl Wolfgang the first to conquer the north side of the Eiskögel mountain peak. He kept mountaineering and hiking through the mountains all his life, even past his 90th birthday. As a trainer, Rössner was also an all-rounder, and he had more success as well. He started out as a trainer of the Austrian cross country team, achieving 4th and 5th places for the relay team at the 1948 and 1952 Olympics. In 1950, he also took up the management of the Austrian male alpine skiers, which had been relatively unsuccessful at the 1948 Olympics. Having obtained a university degree in physical education, he introduced training methods that were rather unorthodox for the time, including a summer program, heavy conditional training and development of explosive strength. His approach proved very successful, and the Austrian men won 5 medals at the 1952 Winter Olympics. The “White Miracle Team” grabbed all podium spots in the downhill race at the 1954 World Championships, and won 6 medals in Cortina d’Ampezzo, including 3 gold medals for Toni Sailer and a clean sweep of the giant slalom. After the 1956 season Rössner stepped down following an internal quarrel in the Austrian Skiing Federation, although he did not give up his position as cross country coach. “Fred” Rössner, changed his focus towards the summer sports. Already in 1956, he coached Austrian kayakers Max Raub and Herbert Wiedermann to a bronze medal in the 1000 m K2 event. He coached the Austrian rowers and kayakers at the next four Olympics as well, coaching another bronze medal boat in 1968. During this period, he was also the president of the Austrian wrestling federation. In 1958, he was assigned director of the Elite section of the Austrian Federal Institute for Physical Education. From 1969 to 1987, Rössner was a member of the council of the Fédération Internationale de Ski (FIS), uniquely serving in subcommittees for cross country skiing, alpine skiing and ski jumping. From 1987 on, he was an honorary member of the FIS.

At the World Championships his best performance came in 1966 when he won the individual title and helped the West Germans to the team dressage title. Neckermann was the father of Eva-Maria Pracht and the grandfather of Martina Pracht. He made his fortune as the owner of one of Europe’s largest department stores. His business made him director of a very successful mail-order company under the slogan Neckermann macht’s möglich (Neckermann makes it possible). The company began with the Aryanization of Jewish property, among others of Karl Amson Joel, the grandfather of the US singer and composer Billy Joel. Karl Joel was forced to sell his company to Neckermann for an unrealistic purchase price in 1938, with the original agreement of 2.3 million marks further reduced by Neckermann to 1.1 million marks. In 1957 Joel received a compensation of 2 million German marks from Neckermann for his former company. After World War II Neckermann was condemned by the USA and was imprisoned until 1946 near Bamberg. After his release, he founded Neckermann Textil-Versand KG in 1950, which made him a synonym for the West German economic miracle. In 1972, Neckermann was the oldest German Olympic medalist with 60 years and 96 days. In 1967, on the advice of Willi Daume, he founded the foundation Deutsche Sporthilfe, which still promotes high-performance athletes, becoming president of this organization. In the 1970s, his company went bankrupt and was bought up by Karstadt AG. In 1992 his autobiography Im starken Trab (In Strong Trot) was published.

The following year, 1954, he took up judo at the Budokwai as one of the youngest pupils under the great coach Trevor Leggett. At the age of 16, Hoare became the youngest person in the United Kingdom to obtain a Dan grade and later became the youngest British black belt. At 17 he was a member of the Great Britain team. Hoare’s favourite technique was the osoto-gari, which he developed by practicing uchikoma in a swimming pool against the resistance of the water. He trained at the Kodokan in Japan for the three years leading up to the 1964 Tokyo Olympics, when he was a member of the first British Olympic judo squad. The following year he travelled with the squad to Madrid for the European Championships, where Hoare won an open weight silver medal, despite being only a middleweight. He lost to the 6ft 7in (2.01m) West German Alfred Meier. Hoare went on to become a national coach and examiner, and between 1985-87 replaced the former British Olympic Association Chairman Charles Palmer as chairman of the British Judo Association. Hoare ran his own club, the London Judo Society, at Stockwell for 11 years, before the building was acquired by developers, and Hoare returned to the Budokwai. A fluent Japanese speaker, he obtained an honours degree in Japanese history, language, literature and religion from London University, and with his Japanese influence, founded the British Sumo Association. In 1992 he sent a British team to the first Amateur Sumo World Championships. A man of many talents, Sydney Hoare wrote several books on judo and self-defence, including the very popular A Slow Boat to Yokohama.

As a freshman he stroked the Cornell freshman eight to a victory at the IRAs, and repeated that victory with the varsity in both 1961 and 1962. In 1963 he had an unusual club affiliation, rowing for the Club de Nautique de Saigon at the Hong Kong Regatta, while a lieutenant in the Navy on tour in Vietnam. Upon returning home in 1963 he joined the Vesper BC and again was the stroke oar for their Olympic eight in 1964. At the 1967 PanAmerican Games he also won a gold medal, this time in the fours. Two of his teammates in that boat were from the 1964 Vesper Olympic eight, Hugh Foley and coxswain Bob Zimonyi). Stowe later became crew coach at Columbia University from 1967-71, where he was known for leading US federal marshalls through underground tunnels to help them take back the campus, after it had been taken over by SDS (Students for a Dissident Society). After Columbia, Stowe established the rowing program at the US Coast Guard Academy, helping them dominate the Dad Vails Regatta for several years. He was a rowing commentator for ABC Television at the 1968 and 1972 Olympics. In 2011, Stowe received the Jack Kelly Award, “which recognizes superior achievements in rowing, service to amateur athletics, and success in their chosen profession, thereby serving as an inspiration to American rowers.”",Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the Summer Pan American Games (1–0–0 1967 Winnipeg ROW gold: coxed fours)

He set seven world records and six European records. From 1950-58, he earned 14 international caps. In 1951, in Berlin, he won the World College Championships in the 100 and 200 butterfly and the 3x100 metre medley relay. He would have contended for medals at the 1952 Helsinki Olympics, but due to negative comments about Soviet competitors, he was not selected. In 1954, Tumpek won the European Championship in the 200 metre butterfly in Torino, and the 100 and 200 butterflys and medley relay at the World College Championships in Budapest. He finished third in the 200 butterfly at the 1956 Melbourne Olympics. At the 1958 European Championships in Budapest, he won a silver medal in the relay and was eighth in the 200 butterfly. Tumpek retired from competitive sports in 1958. He was already a member of the Sports Squadron since 1949, and then became a professional soldier. In 1971, he obtained a professional coaching certificate. He was the coach of Honvéd for 20 years and head of the methodology sub-department.

921117,Willy Sluiter,Male,24 May 1873,,, Netherlands,NED,"Willy Sluiter was a painter, draftsman, and graphic artist. He studied at the Art Academy in Rotterdam from 1891-94 and then at the Art Academy in Den Haag. He was mainly influenced by impressionism and especially by the works of Toulouse-Lautrec. Sluiter found his subjects on the beach and in the life of fishermen, but he was also a successful portrait painter. He also produced lithographs, caricatures, and advertising posters. He participated in four consecutive Olympic Games in the Art Competitions in the category paintings (1924-36). In 1928 he was also a member of the jury in this section. Easily identified is Sluiter’s drawing De bokswedstrijd van Joe Beckett tegen Tommy Burns, Londen 1920 in charcoal and pastel on paper on cardboard (74.3 x 99.0 cm), dated 1920. The fight against Joe Beckett (1892–1965) on 16 July 1920, in London, was former world champion’s Tommy Burns (1881-1955) last professional fight, which he lost by knockout in the 7th round. An example of Sluiter’s numerous drawings of the Swiss winter sports resorts of Davos and St. Moritz is the graphic of a bobsled launch published in the magazine Jugend in 1903. The attribution of the painting showing a soccer scene in the possession of the Dutch Football Association KNVB from the 1920s is uncertain, as well. Most of the drawings exhibited in 1928, however, could be identified with a high degree of certainty: the caricature of tennis player Bill Tilden, who played in Nordwijk, among other places, was reproduced in “Sport in Beeld” in 1928 as one of the most highly regarded at the art exhibition. The drawing of a tennis player (The Tennis Player, ink, chalk and watercolor, 27 x 21 cm) shows the Japanese Davis Cup finalist Zenzo Shimizu (1891–1977), who often played with a hat. The soccer cartoon Voetballers co(a)lisie is shown in the catalog and thus clearly identifiable. The tennis caricature Mixed double bij tennissen is probably identical with the submitted Tennis Cartoon. In 1932, Sluiter shifted again more to paintings like Sky-sprong in Davos, which was also reproduced in the report on the art exhibition in “Sport in Beeld”. Candidates for Yachting are Zeilen op de Hollandsche plassen (Sailing on the Dutch lakes) and Zeilen op de Olympische Spelen. The latter was created in 1928 as a watercolor in the format 31 x 22 cm (as an illustration). Of Cresta Run, St. Moritz only a 1910 drawing is preserved (colored pencil and pencil, 9 x 12 cm). Horse Jumping Competition, submitted in 1936, could refer to De klassieke hurdle-sprong or Springruiter op de Olympische Spelen 1928 (illustration, watercolor on paper, 31 x 22 cm). The deviating, almost cubistic style of the drawing Cricket is striking.",

He came to prominence in 1922 after joining his father John’s club, the Hull Thursday RC and that same year he was the National 50 mile champion and winner of the prestigious Anfield ‘100’. In the four Anfield races he contested between 1922-25 he won twice, once off scratch, and in 1925 established a course record. Like his father before him, Andy became an Olympian in 1924 but, despite being one of the favourites for the road race he was a disappointing 22nd albeit the highest placed British rider. Great Britain finished seventh in the team competition. He represented England in the 1923, 1924 and 1925 UCI World Championships, finishing 18th, 13th and 21st respectively. Andy was a very popular person on and off the bike because of his good nature and great sportsmanship. He was a chemist for the Terry’s chocolate factory in York but his desire was to constantly break road cycling records and over Easter 1926 he knocked a staggering 52 minutes off the unpaced record time for the 189 3/4-mile York to Edinburgh trip. A week after that he set the fastest time in the Yorkshire RC ‘25’ handicap but shortly after that he had a cold which developed into pleurisy which was to kill him within a week. Wilson died at the age of 23 on 21 April 1926, the same day that Queen Elizabeth II was born.

The War years then interrupted his skating career, and in 1941 he joined the RAF, being demobilised five years later with the rank of flying officer. During the War, he had established a partnership with his younger sister Winnie and in 1946 they uniquely twice won the British pairs title after it was held in May and December that same year. Unfortunately, they could not defend their title in 1947, because Winnie fractured her leg in practice just one week before the Championships. Dennis entered the men’s singles, however, and finished a creditable second to the former world champion Graham Sharp. Dennis and Winnie won the pairs silver medal at the 1947 European Championships at Davos, and were fourth in the Worlds. The following year, at the St. Moritz Winter Olympics, they finished fifth, one place better than their performance at the Worlds that year. Shortly after the Olympics, the pair turned professional and took part in ice spectaculars, originally in their home-town Brighton, but then all over the United Kingdom and across Europe. Dennis went to live in Canada in the early 1950s, and devoted a large part of his time to developing the sport of figure skating in his adopted “home”, where he ran the Silverthorne Skating School for over 40 years. Being a leading coach, he also served on the board of the Figure Skating Coaches of Canada, and various advisory committees and training seminars. One of the many skaters Silverthorne was responsible for coaching was Donald McPherson who, in 1963, became the first man to win the Canadian, North American and World Men’s titles in the same season. He also became the youngest men’s world champion. The legacy of Dennis Silverthorne went beyond coaching skaters, as he also trained many skating coaches and judges.

After his retirement, Mongush worked as a wrestling coach and referee. On 9 June 2013, after officiating a local khuresh tournament in Kyzyl, Republic of Tyva, Mongush did not return home and a missing person case was opened by the police.

By the time of the 1982 Commonwealth Games, where he won silver medals for Canada in the 100 and the 4×100 relay, his star on the international athletics scene was rising rapidly. Although he failed to reach the podium at the 1983 World Championships and Pan American Games (5th), he was a member of Canada’s delegation to the 1984 Summer Olympics, where he received bronze medals in 100 and the 4×100. He finally captured gold in these events at the 1986 Commonwealth Games, where he also took home bronze in the 200 m competition. Already a world record-holder in the indoor 60 metres, Johnson was made a member of the Order of Canada in 1987, the same year that he won gold in the 100 metre event at the World Championships with a world record of 9.83 seconds. His achievements earned him a Lou Marsh Trophy as Canada’s top sportsperson of the year and the title of Associated Press Athlete of the Year for 1987. At the 1988 Summer Olympics he again captured gold in the 100 m, this time besting his own world record with a run of 9.79 seconds, a mark that would not be seen again until Maurice Greene achieved it in 1999. Johnson would be the Canadian Press’ Newsmaker of the Year for 1988, but not for laudable reasons. He was disqualified from the event three days later after testing positive for steroids. Forced to return his gold medal and stricken from the record books, he eventually admitted to having taken steroids since 1981, although he was stripped of none of his achievements that had occurred prior to 1987. He attempted a comeback after his suspension ended in 1991, even making the Canadian national squad for the 1992 Summer Olympics, but he performed poorly and within a year had received a lifetime ban for another doping incident.

58160,Louis Bruce,Male,17 December 1875,,, Great Britain,GBR,"Louis Bruce was born as Louis Bruce McAvoy Mortimore Doney in Edinburgh, Scotland in December of 1875, the son of Jane Elizabeth Doney (née Mortimore), a widowed nurse. Her husband, Henry Doney, who was a cab proprietor, died in 1870; the couple had three daughters prior to Louis’ birth. The identity of Bruce’s father is unclear, though he is stated to have been William King Bruce, a medical practitioner. Further research into this has not yielded any results as of yet. Louis Bruce was raised for the first decade of his life in Plympton, Devon. There, he lived at Frogmore Cottage with his grandmother Elizabeth Mortimore and two aunts. His mother, who lived nearby, eventually remarried in 1879 to Richard Dingley Hobbs, a victualler. With him, she had another son, William Kendle Hobbs, in 1880. Louis Bruce relocated to Hammersmith, London by the early 1900s where he took up work as a tram driver for London United Tramways (LUT), based at Fulwell Depot. Initially granted a tram license in 1900, he was later noted to have been one of the first, and perhaps only Black tram drivers in London at the time. Active in the social life of his profession, he frequently performed in entertainment acts as a dancer, ragtime singer and comedian in tramway social events and concerts. On 1 March 1906, as presumably one of the most trusted and senior motormen in London, Bruce was present at the side of Councilor Henry Charles Minnitt, mayor of Kingston-upon-Thames, as the mayor ceremonially took the controls of the first London United Tramways electric tram (car no. 320) to cross the Kingston Bridge over the River Thames as a part of a new route to Tolworth and Surbiton. A week prior, Bruce also was in charge of driving government officials and inspectors on a test run of the new route, held on 21 February. Photos from these events are the only known photos of Bruce that we have been able to discover thus far. Held in high regard within his profession, he was also the personal tram driver for Sir J. Clifton Robinson, the Managing Director of the Imperial Tramways Company. As a member of the Hammersmith Amateur Wrestling Club and Grove House Athletic Club, Louis Bruce featured in heavyweight wrestling matches around the London area starting from at least 1905. During this time, his skin color predictably led him to be frequently referred to by various ethnic epithets by the press, such as “Darkey” or as “coloured”. One of the highlights of his athletic career would come in 1908, when he was one of 14 members of the Hammersmith AWC to feature at the Olympic Games in London; there, he defeated Alfred Banbrook of London Amateur Wrestling Society in the first round, but lost his next matchup to frequent opponent, fellow countryman and clubmate Ernest Nixson. At 32 years old, he was the oldest British competitor to participate in the wrestling events. He later joined a club based in Shepherd’s Bush by 1909. Bruce was also actively involved in sporting affairs of the London United Tramways Club and Institute throughout the 1900s and 1910s. There he participated in events such as race walking and heavyweight boxing, winning a championship title in the latter in January 1913. In 1914, at the age of 38, he also won the LUT one mile walking handicap at Griffin Park. Bruce later rose through the ranks and was working as an inspector of trams by 1911. That same year, he married Ethel Elizabeth Dunn at St Peter & St Paul Church in Teddington with whom he had a son, Dennis, in September of 1917. He continued to work with LUT until at least 1921. By the late 1930s, Bruce, now in his mid-sixties, was working as a shopkeeper of a news and confectionery shop in Sutton, Surrey. He died there on 31 March 1958 at the age of 82. At the time of his death, he was survived by his wife and left an estate valued at £5,897. Though his Olympic result might arguably have been insignificant, Louis Bruce holds the distinction of being the first, and earliest known Black person to have represented Great Britain at the Olympic Games. This was previously thought to have been sprinter Harry Edward (Antwerpen 1920), until research conducted by Olympic historians uncovered Bruce’s story. He had been previously listed in records under the inaccurate name of “Lawrence Bruce” for many years, until his entry form was rediscovered in December 2021.",

However, he was probably the most interesting of the Great Britain squad. A double Oxford football Blue, he won two FA Amateur Cup winners’ medals with the crack Pegasus team in 1951, in the first final to attract a 100,000 spectators to Wembley, and again in 1953. He also won eight England amateur caps and played two games in the Football League for Charlton Athletic and scored the winner on his début against Tottenham Hotspur. But, whilst that is impressive, it was at cricket where Pawson established himself. Also a cricket double Blue, he was a right-handed batsman and played First Class cricket for Oxford University and Kent, from 1946-53, and scored nearly 4,000 First Class runs. Whilst at Winchester College he once scored 237 runs at Lord’s as a 15-year-old. During World War II Pawson attained the rank of Major in the Rifle Brigade and saw active service in the North African campaign. After the War he was a personnel director at Reed International and also became a distinguished football and cricket writer for the Observer in 1968 and was chairman of the Cricket Writers’ Club in 1980 and 1981. He joined the England fly-fishing team in 1978 and on the River Tormes at Salamanca, Spain in 1984 caught 23 trout to became the first Englishman to win the world fly-fishing title. He was awarded the OBE in 1988 for his services to angling after he campaigned for better access for disabled anglers. His autobiography in 1980 embraced the love of his three sports and he entitled it Runs and Catches. Pawson died in 2012, after his wife Hilarie died the previous year, and his son Anthony, a well known Canadian scientist, died of unspecified causes less than a year after Tony’s death .",

With Fyodorov, she won the bronze medal at the 1993 World Championships and was sixth at the 1994 Winter Olympics, but their partnership was short-lived.

He received his artistic education first in Iceland and from 1919 in København and München. In his time Einarsson was controversial in Iceland, but later interest in his work grew. Because of his versatility, he left 1000s of works, many in public spaces. These include oil paintings, sculptures, glasswork, watercolors, prints and ceramics, drawings, furniture based on his designs, jewelry, brass and silverware, gardens, individual houses, and wall decorations. His style was eclectic and influenced by Romanticism. With the advent of modernism in Iceland, he also developed a tendency toward abstraction. Einarsson was also one of the pioneers of mountaineering in Iceland. He was an explorer, active conservationist, hunter, and traveler, activities which resulted in books, photographs, and films. His son Guðmundur “Erró” (born 1932) also became a well-known visual artist, and his half-brother Ari Trausti (born 1948) a well-known geologist and writer. In 1952 Guðmundur Einarsson was represented in the art exhibition with the plaster sculpture Hinn eilífi Ólympíueldur (Eternal Olympic Flame).

920626,Walter Gropius,Male,18 May 1883,,, Germany,GER,"Walter Gropius was the grandnephew of architect Martin Gropius, and the son of Walter Gropius, Sr. In 1910 Walter Gropius began an affair with Alma Mahler, the wife of composer Gustav Mahler and married her in 1915 after the composer’s death, but the marriage, however, ended in divorce in 1920. Three years later he married the journalist and writer Ilse Frank. In 1910, after working for two years with the firm of Peter Behrens, Gropius started his own business as a designer and architect without having achieved a degree, bringing with him fellow Behrens employee Adolf Meyer. In the 1920s his idiosyncratic style was called “New Construction / New Objectivity”. Like no one else, he influenced the design of industrial goods and is considered one of the pioneers of modern architecture. After the 1st World War, Gropius took over the Grand-Ducal Saxon School of Arts and Crafts in Weimar (later Dessau), which became the Bauhaus School. He acted as its director from 1919-28, and is considered the leader of the Bauhaus Movement. Subsequently, he designed numerous residential projects like the Siemensstadt in Berlin. In 1934 Gropius escaped from the Nazis, first to Great Britain, and then in 1937 to the United States, living in a suburb of Boston – Lincoln, Massachusetts. His ideas were later the basis for prefabricated housing in satellite towns of many major cities. Gropius taught at the Harvard Graduate School of Design and became a naturalized US citizen in 1944. In 1945 he co-founded The Architects’ Collaborative in Cambridge, Massachusetts, which became one of the most respected architectural firms in the world for the next 50 years, although the firm dissolved in bankruptcy in 1995. In 1967 Gropius became an Associate Member of the National Academy of Design and was elected a full member in 1968. After World War II Gropius returned to Berlin and planned, amongst others, the so-called Gropiusstadt. Both the West and East German Post Offices issued stamps showing buildings that he designed during the Bauhaus era. In 1927, the Municipal Authority of Halle advertised an architectural competition for a cultural center on the Lehmann’s rock with a town hall, a museum and sports facilities. Gropius’ “Hanging Gardens” design arranged the buildings in a way to best exploit the topography of the terrain. His design was probably too abstract for the local jury. Eventually none of the designs was realized.",

69547,Alfred Tysoe,Male,21 March 1874,175.0,70, Great Britain,GBR,"Educated at Brooklands School, Sale near Manchester, Alfred Tysoe, a Lancashire farm worker, achieved his first championship successes in 1896 when he won the Northern Counties 1,000 yards and mile titles. They were to be the first of his 22 National and local titles. The following year he established a national reputation by winning the AAA mile and 10 miles championships, and in 1898 he was a member of the Salford Harriers team that won the National cross-country team championship. In view of his obvious talent as a distance runner, it came as a surprise when Tysoe returned to the shorter distances but the decision was soon justified. He won the Northern Counties mile in 1898 with a time time that stood as a record for 38 years. He won the AAA 880 yards title in 1899 and retained the title in 1900 in 1:57.8, which topped the world rankings that year. One week after his AAA victory Tysoe won the Olympic 800 metres title in Paris in a slow 2:01.2 and he later won a gold medal in the 5,000 metre team race in which he himself finished seventh. After his disappointing time in the 800 metres, Tysoe was anxious to give the French a better indication of his true abilities, and he entered for the handicap events which concluded the Games. Although he was eliminated after finishing only fifth in his heat in the 800 metre handicap race, his time of 1:57.8, off scratch, was a new French All-Comers record. Tysoe concluded the 1900 season by defeating the new Olympic 1,500 metre champion, Charles Bennett of Finchley Harriers, in a challenge match over 1320 yards. The contest, at Belle Vue, Manchester, attracted a large crowd and Bennett led for most of the race until Tysoe overtook him on the final turn and pulled away to win by 12 yards. Tragically, this was to be the last race of his career. Early in 1901 he contracted pleurisy and died later that year at his father’s home at the age of 27.

38165,Miltiades Manno,Male,19 February 1879,,, Hungary,HUN,"Miltiades Manno was a 1912 Olympian in rowing, becoming one of the few athletes who also took part in the art competitions. He came from a family of Greek immigrants and was successful in many sports, including swimming, cycling, football, rowing, and speed skating. In football, he was the top scorer of the Budapesti TC, who won the first two Hungarian Championships in 1901 and 1902, and Manno twice played in friendlies with the national team. In speed skating, Manno placed in the top three at the 1903 and 1905 European Championships and the 1903 World Championships. In rowing, he won a total of 11 national championships and also achieved international success, particularly in the singles. After graduating from the Academy of Fine Arts in München in 1907, Manno became a graphic artist, painter and sculptor, but he was also known as a caricaturist and portrait painter. In World War I, he was wounded several times while fighting in Galicia and subsequently had to retire from sports. As a civilian, he returned to the Galician theatre and depicted the battlefield in numerous pictures, which he later used to create sculptures showing horse attacks, some of which are still offered at auctions. Sport continued to be one of his favorite topics as an artist. His sculptures are still sold at auctions today. After the end of the short-lived Hungarian Republic of Councils in 1920, Manno supported the autocratic Hungarian Regent Miklós Horthy. Until his death in 1935, Manno also supported the spread of European anti-Semitism. Because of this, after World War II, a veil of silence was drawn over his life. Manno competed in Los Angeles with a total of 27 works in the categories of drawings and watercolors (10), graphic art (7) and sculpture (10), and won the silver medal in Sculpturing with his work Wrestling. The original of this sculpture is now on display in the Sports Museum in Budapest. This bronze version is 80 x 80 x 70 cm in size. His models were the well-known Hungarian wrestlers Béla Varga and László Papp. The sculpture, initially made in ceramics, was cast in bronze for the 1932 art competition. The Start of the sprinter (also titled Short distance runner at the start) was a bronze figure in the format 43 x 25 cm. The bronze medal For the anniversary of the Hungarian Football Association was designed on the occasion of the 25th anniversary of the Hungarian Football Association in 1926 with a diameter of 8 cm. The Military Sports Medal was awarded in the 1930s on various occasions, which were engraved on the back respectively. The identification of the University Sports Medal from 1930 is less clear. One type was created for the Péter Pázmány University (now Loránd Eötvös University) in Budapest with a diameter of 38 mm. In 1928 Manno designed the Turul bird emblem for the football department of the Ferencvaros TC, which had just started professional operation. The motif of the Turul, a mythical creature that is today used mainly by the right-wing groups, may also have been produced as a medal. What survived of his paintings and graphic works are mainly the posters, such as one for the opening of a sports exhibition at the National Museum in 1926 and another one for a soccer match between the city teams of Budapest and Berlin in 1923. Whether these were among the submitted works is unknown.",Brother of Leonidasz Manno

The medals and plaques show military subjects but also portraits of well-known personalities.

Stevenson traveled through the British Isles and on the Continent, and trained in Spain under the master Joaquin Sorolla (1863-1923), whose influence can be noted in Stevenson’s rich use of color, beauty of design, and the quality of romance. As a student of John Singer Sargent, Stevenson also benefited from critiques of Sargent that warned him against some of the common pitfalls in portraiture, especially the tendency of many to make the head too large or the figure too dominant for its surroundings. Stevenson later became a prolific magazine illustrator for prominent publications, notably the New York Times Book Review. He also made a series of portraits for the covers of Time magazine (1923-24). In 1932, Stevenson entered three graphics, On the Willowemoc, Hung Up, and Sunset. The Willowemoc is a creek in New York State that is popular for trout fishing. The other two prints were acquired by the Brooklyn Museum immediately after the 1932 art show.

To save costs, the building was reduced by one floor. Construction began in 1938. In 1941, the German occupiers completed the complex in order to use it as a sports center and SS hospital. In 1991, the building, an example of the functionalism in the time between the world wars, was returned to the Sokol. It is still one of the largest of its kind and houses a large hall, two small pitches with artificial turf, a swimming pool and other smaller halls. Marek was initially trained as a mason and later studied at the Praha Academy of Fine Arts from 1922-26. His most famous work was the War Memorial in Lidiče, where in 1942, after the assassination of the head of the Reich Security Main Office Reinhard Heydrich, all male residents were shot by the SS in retaliation, and the village was razed to the ground.

Following the outbreak of World War I, he went overseas with the British Expeditionary Force, but was injured in the early part of the war and returned to England. Campbell eventually returned to France, and in 1916 set up what later became the School of Physical, Bayonet, and Recreational Training. This new school incorporated competitive and combative games into training, and this would serve as the basis for Army training for many years to follow. Campbell retired from the Army in 1924 with the rank of Colonel. He was awarded the DSO (Distinguished Service Order) in 1917, was three times mentioned in dispatches, and in 1923 was honoured with the OBE. At the time of his retirement he was Inspector of Army Physical Training.

He then transferred again, this time to the Slade School of Fine Art and completed his studies with a two-year stay (1926-1928) in Paris. There he met dancer Rupert Doone (1903-1966) and he lived with him for the rest of his life. In the 1930s Medley worked in various avant-garde styles and had his first solo exhibition in 1931. In the same year he also started teaching at the Chelsea Art School. In the years that followed, he did mostly design work for the theater. In 1932 he founded the Group Theatre together with his partner Doone and became its artistic director. Both invited Auden to write plays for the group. In 1936, Medley exhibited at the International Surrealist Exhibition in London and one year later he founded the Artists’ International Association (AIA) promoting socialist and avant-garde art. During World War II, Medley was initially deployed as an air raid warden. A contract as a war painter in France was blocked by the secret service MI5 because of his alleged closeness to communism. He then served in England before going to Egypt as a camouflage officer. After the war he lived in London and taught for several years at the Chelsea Art School (now part of Chelsea College of Art and Design). Medley was also a visiting lecturer at the Slade School of Art and later became head of the Department of Theater Design. As an artist, he turned to abstraction in the 1960s, but later returned to figurative painting. The latter paintings received special attention. In 1966 he became chairman of the faculty of painting at the British School in Rome. In 1982 he was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire and in 1985 was elected as a member of the Royal Academy. Cyclists against a Blue Background, one of the paintings in his Summer Eclogue No. 1 series created between 1950 and 1952, won a prize at the Festival of Britain “60 Paintings for 51”. Cyclists from 1950 (oil on canvas, 129.5 x 160 cm), also from this series, was purchased by the Tate Gallery in 1992. In Helsinki in 1952 he also showed a painting titled Cyclists, which is likely to be this work.",

Harrop represented Dalziel High School in local galas, and then went on to compete at a national level. A dental student in 1948, Harrop finished third behind Ron Stedman and Pat Kendall in the 100 metres freestyle at the Olympic trial at Scarborough, and got the call-up to join the Great Britain squad.

Harrop also returned to Canada, in 1950, and obtained a degree from Dalhousie University in Halifax before setting up a dental practice in Campbell River. Harrop later helped set up the dental school at the University of British Columbia, where he worked for 25 years.

In the 1957-58 season Stiegler won seven races, adding several more in 1958-59. In January 1960 he won his most important title to date with a victory at Wengen, winning the Lauberhorn. This set him up for the 1960 Winter Olympics, where he won a silver medal in the giant slalom. Over the next few years Stiegler continued to win international races, including four Austrian Championships with slalom titles in 1960 and 1961, giant slalom in 1963 and a combined victory in 1961. At Innsbruck in 1964 Stiegler won Olympic gold in the slalom with a bronze medal in the giant slalom, and in 1964 Stiegler was Austrian Sportsman of the Year. Stiegler moved to the United States in 1965 where he became the ski school director at Jackson Hole, Wyoming, a post he held for 29 years. He was then named ambassador of skiing at Jackson Hole, finally retiring in 2002, after 37 years with the resort. In 1996 Stiegler was given a gold decoration for services to the Austrian Republic. In 2001 Stiegler was inducted into the US Skiing Hall of Fame. His daughter, Resi Stiegler, raced in Alpine skiing at the 2006 and 2014 Winter Olympics for the United States, as she was raised a US citizen. Stiegler himself went back to school and in May 2003 earned a bachelor’s degree from Montana State University in English literature. Sadly, in 1993 he was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis, and in a rare coincidence, so was American skiier Jimmy Heuga, who had finished third behind Stiegler in the slalom at the 1964 Winter Olympics.","Father of Resi Stiegler Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the World Alpine Ski Championships (1–1–1 1960 Squaw Valley (Olympics) silver: giant slalom; 1964 Innsbruck (Olympics) gold: slalom, bronze: giant slalom)"

After breaking 6,000 points in the heptathlon for the first time in 2003 she made a considerable improvement in the early part of 2004 and started the Athens Olympics in the new found position of British number one heptathlete. After a solid first day of Olympic competition she produced a very poor performance in the javelin and it was only an inspired 800 metre run that allowed her to win the bronze medal. Her weakness in the javelin was to cost her dearly at both the 2005 World Championships and the 2006 European Championships, where medal winning positions were lost due to disastrous performances in the discipline, although she did triumph in the less rarified atmosphere of the Commonwealth Games. Her javelin weakness was mitigated by another barnstorming run in the 800 at the 2007 World Championships and she was able to add a World Championship bronze to her collection. A second Olympic medal was beyond her reach in 2008 and, after losing most of 2009 and 2010 due to injury, she decided to retire as a heptathlete with a view to continuing as a 400 metre specialist. After moderate success she announced that, as of late 2011, she would be returning to the heptathlon with a view to competing at the 2012 Olympics. A forthright and opinionated character, she had a bitter rivalry with Liudmyla Blonska after the latter’s return to athletics after a doping ban.

920724,Max Slevogt,Male,8 October 1868,,, Germany,GER,"German painter Max Slevogt stands alongside Max Liebermann and Lovis Corinth as the most important German Impressionists. Slevogt is considered one of the last open-air painters. He studied from 1884-89 in München and then moved to Paris for further training, where he turned to French Impressionism. In 1901 he settled in Berlin and became a member of the Berlin Secession. In the early years of the 20th century, Slevogt played with the idea to become an opera singer for a long period, especially as he was extremely fascinated by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart’s “Don Giovanni” and he had a very beautiful voice. In 1914 he traveled to Egypt, where he reached the peak of his career. During World War I he worked as an official war artist and was severely shocked by the suffering of the soldiers. Towards the end of the war, he joined the Royal Academy of Arts in Berlin. In the 1920s, Slevogt painted numerous stage sets, leaving behind a rich oeuvre. In the Villa Ludwigshöhe in Edenkoben, the Max Slevogt Gallery has been scientifically supervised by the Landesmuseum Mainz since 1980. Since 1972, a Max-Slevogt-Medal has been awarded to artists or their sponsors by the Prime Minister of Rhineland-Palatinate. In 1978, the German Federal Post devoted a stamp to Slevogt in the series on German Expressionism. Max Slevogt came from an art-oriented family, some of his relatives included: Adolf Slevogt (1819–1885), a court theater painter, and Hugo Slevogt (1857-1926), a famous architect. One more relative was Marquard Slevogt, an ice hockey player participating at the 1928 and 1932 Winter Olympics in St. Moritz respectively Lake Placid. Slevogt’s painting Piqueur is shown in the German exhibition catalog. It was proposed for the first prize at the 1928 Amsterdam Art Competitions by the German jury members. But the other jury members agreed on “a Dutch painting to win and in second place on an English one”. Hence the third prize was given to a German artist, Walther Klemm, while Slevogt’s painting was decommissioned from the competition, which also happened to a painting by Liebermann and a sculpture by Georg Kolbe. This statement could not be verified, however. Two submitted paintings show scenes of harness racing, a frequent subject in Slevogt’s work. The artist had been attracted to this sport by his publisher Bruno Cassirer (1872-1941). An image from the international catalog shows Trabrennen (Harness Racing, oil on canvas, 35 x 59 cm.). It was painted in 1907 and was already acquired by the Berlin State Museums in 1916. Another one was painted only around 1920 and is titled Trabrennbahn in Ruhleben (Trotting Racecourse in Ruhleben). It is now in possession of the Städtische Galerie Lenbachhaus & Kunstbau München. Slevogt also exhibited lithographs on the topic of Harness Racing in Amsterdam. According to the German catalog, there were twelve of them altogether. The international catalog calls them generally Graphic Works and lists only six sub-numbers. Probably these lithographs belonged to a series of 13 sheets, which were drawn on-site on transfer paper in the format of 35 x 45 cm.",

He turned professional later in 1956 and Italian cycling fans envisioned him as the next campionissimo. However, although he won the world professional road race title and the Giro d’Italia in 1958, he was never quite as successful as a professional rider. In 1957 he broke his own world hour record. His career highlights were concentrated in three seasons – 1956-58, during which time he rode as a professional alongside Fausto Coppi. A rouleur, with the nickname of the “Electric train of Forlì”, he was always beset by weight problems, and was at his best in time trials. At the 1958 Giro he took the maglia rosa on the second stage, dominated the time trial at Viareggio, and even won a mountain finish in Verona Bosco Chiesanuova. Later that year, at the Worlds, he dropped the breakaway group, including Coppi, Louison Bobet, and Gastone Nencini, on the penultimate lap and won by over two minutes ahead of Bobet. Baldini raced through 1964, but was never able to reach those heights again, partially due to problems with his weight, but also due to complications after an appendectomy. In 2016 he was named to the Giro d’Italia Hall of Fame alongside Eddy Merckx, Felice Gimondi, Stephen Roche, and Francesco Moser.

He worked primarily as a ceramist before he immigrated to the United States in 1921. He and another Danish artist, Kai G. Götzsche, travelled around and met D. H. Lawrence and his wife, Frieda. The Lawrence’s convinced them to remain in New Mexico for the winter. During the winter of 1922-23 Merrild created a body of work relating to New Mexico and later wrote a book about his experiences with D. H. Lawrence, A Poet and Two Painters, which was first published in 1939 and made him well-known. In 1927, Merrild went to Los Angeles for the next 25 years. There he created his most significant work, an output of several hundred works in a range of styles. Merrild’s early works were cubist inspired paintings and watercolours. He later experimented with different materials in an effort to create works with three-dimensional outputs. His works were mostly described as surrealistic and were included in recent survey exhibitions dealing with Surrealism in the United States. In 1942 he developed a totally new technique of painting which he called “flux”, a process by which he alternatively poured or dripped paints onto a fluid surface. In some cases, the resulting works were entirely abstract while in others, concrete images could be recognized. In 1952 Merrild suffered a heart attack and returned to his native country seeking less expensive medical care. He did not produce any more work in Denmark and died in 1954. Only two of his submitted paintings for the Olympics could be identified: “Tennis Player”, a stencil cardboard with watercolour and gouache from 1932, sized 38 x 28 cm, and “Soccer”, an oil on canvas painting in the format 96,5 x 66 cm, created around 1928.

He served with the Machine Gun Corps in World War I, and was awarded the Military Cross for gallantry in 1918. He later served with the Suffolk Yeomanry and reached the rank of major. At the age of 14 Artis was involved in an accident that could have wiped out the family farm completely. He accidentally set fire to a cowshed, which resulted in extensive damage and a small loss of life to livestock. Upon his father’s death, Artis took over the running of the farm. A keen rifleman, Artis was a member of the Society of Miniature Rifle Clubs and in 1914 represented England in a tournament involving the four Home Countries, which England won. That same year, he represented England again, in an international match against the United States and Canada. Artis enjoyed success at Bisley in 1928 when he helped Suffolk finish second in the Queen Alexandra Cup.

He also won three other medals at the World Championships. He was elected Austrian Sportsman of the Year four consecutive times (1998-2001). Maier made two remarkable comebacks during his career. The first was after the 1998 Winter Olympics at Nagano when he had what appeared to be a near-fatal fall in the downhill, only to walk away from it. A few days later, he won the first of his two Olympic gold medals. In 2001 he had a severe motorcycle crash, with an injury to his right lower leg that some thought would necessitate an amputation. But Maier recovered, fought himself back to world’s top level and won his fourth overall World Cup title in 2004. Only four months before the Olympics 2010 in Vancouver he gave up after a knee operation in summer 2009.

Using borrowed money, he was able to start his own construction company in 1915, an enterprise at which he was eminently successful and that made him a wealthy man. Brundage continued competing in track & field athletics after college, joining the Chicago Athletic Association in 1910 and specialized in the all-around event, a 10-event competition that was a precursor to the decathlon. With his all-around talents, Brundage qualified for the 1912 US Olympic team in both the decathlon and pentathlon, and although he finished fifth in the pentathlon at Stockholm, he did not finish the decathlon. He was the first IOC President to have actually competed in the Olympic Games. Continuing to compete even after forming his own company, Brundage eventually won three US Championships in the all-around – in 1914, 1916, and 1918. When his track & field career wound down, Brundage turned to handball (the American individual version) and became one of the best players in Chicago. By the mid-1920s, Brundage had already made a fortune in the construction business, allowing him the freedom to pursue sports administration, and handball was the sport in which his avocation began. After working for several years with the Central Association of the AAU (Amateur Athletic Union), he served as chairman of the national handball committee of the AAU from 1925-27. In 1928 he was elected president of both the AAU (serving until the fall of 1935, except for 1933) and its Olympic arm, the American Olympic Association (AOA), the forerunner of the United States Olympic Committee (USOC). He continued as President of the American Olympic Association, and its successor organizations, until his election as IOC President in 1952. Brundage benefited politically from the proposed American boycott of the 1936 Olympic Games in Berlin. A staunch believer that sport should be kept apart from politics, Brundage took the pro-participation stance. One of the American IOC Members, Ernest Lee Jahncke, supported the boycott, which met with great disfavor from the IOC. In an extremely close vote of delegates at the AAU convention held at the Commodore Hotel in New York City in December 1935, Brundage’s point of view prevailed, and the Americans agreed to participate in the 1936 Berlin Olympics. In June 1936, Charles Sherrill, one of the other US IOC Members, died. Almost concurrently, Jahncke was removed from the IOC because of his stance in favor of boycotting the Berlin Olympics. Brundage was the obvious choice to move onto the IOC and he was confirmed at the 35th IOC Session in Berlin in July 1936. Within one year, Brundage was named to the Executive Board of the IOC. When IOC President Henri de Baillot-Latour died in 1942, the Swede, J. Sigfrid Edström, stood in as de facto President until the end of World War II. One of his first actions was to appoint Brundage as Vice-President. Together, Edström and Brundage kept the IOC together during the War by letters written to the members throughout the world. In 1946, at the first post-war IOC Session, Edström was chosen as IOC President by acclamation. He then appointed his friend, Avery Brundage, 1st Vice-President. In 1952, when Edström stepped down as IOC President, Avery Brundage was elected President of the IOC in a very close vote over David, Lord Burghley, of Great Britain, a former Olympic gold medalist in the 400 metre hurdles. Brundage’s term as IOC President was a difficult one politically for the IOC. The IOC was faced by the question of the two Germanies, the two Koreas, the two Chinas, the apartheid problem in sport in South Africa and Rhodesia, rising problems with professional encroachment on the Olympic Movement, political demonstrations by American blacks, and finally, in the last days of his term, by the horrible massacre of 11 Israeli athletes and coaches in München at the 1972 Olympics. These problems were addressed almost solely by Brundage, who mostly ran the IOC as a one-man show. Brundage was proud of the way in which the two Germany question was handled. Early on, the IOC was able to get the two German states to enter a combined team, and Brundage exulted, “We have succeeded where the politicians could not.” But East Germany continued to press for independent representation at the Olympics and eventually this was granted. Concerning the two Koreas, Brundage also brokered a compromise in which a combined Korean team would compete, but this never occurred as the two Korean states refused to do so. Brundage never made any inroads into solving the problem of the two Chinas, leaving that situation to his successors, Killanin and Samaranch, who were eventually able to produce a solution. South Africa vexed Brundage and the IOC throughout his term of office. South Africa was eventually evicted from the IOC and the Olympic Movement in the 1970s because of apartheid and, in particular, its use of apartheid in choosing its Olympic teams. South Africa would not return to the Olympic fold until 1991, after the fall of apartheid as a political system. Similar problems confronted Brundage in regard to Rhodesia, which led to a potential boycott of the 1972 München Olympics. Brundage was enraged by this and it later led him, during the memorial ceremony for the Israeli hostages in München, to compare the African boycott of München to the Israeli massacres, a comment that evoked outrage from many, including Lord Killanin, who was to succeed him as President in just six days. Brundage believed in amateurism, pure and simple, with no possible compromise. He was especially bothered by the Olympic Winter Games, in which the Alpine skiers openly flaunted advertising on their skis, and many of them were known to be closet professionals. Brundage even proposed canceling the Olympic Winter Games because of the creeping professionalism, or at least canceling the Alpine skiing events, often considered the highlight of the Olympic Winter program. In 1972 he succeeded in the token banning of Austria’s Karl Schranz as a professional. Schranz was a favorite to win several medals and his ouster outraged the Austrian team, who stated that many skiers were being paid by ski companies. Brundage commented that Schranz was the worst and refused to reinstate him. Avery Brundage stepped down as IOC President after the 1972 München Olympics. Shortly thereafter, he married a younger German woman whom he had met during his Olympic travels. After retirement from the IOC, he lived only a few more years, dying in Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Germany, on 7 May 1975. In the 1930s, Brundage competed twice in the literature section of the Olympic art competitions. The Significance of Amateur Sport is probably based on the text of a lecture given by Brundage in 1929 entitled In defense of the amateur code.","Listed in Olympians Who Served as President of a National Olympic Committee (USA: 1928-1952) Listed in Olympians With a Net Worth > $100M ($250M (Wikipedia, 1960 - inflation corrected)) Listed in Olympic Order Recipients (1975 (Gold) (posthumously))"

In the same year she received fellowships for the Juilliard School in New York and the Berkshire Music Centre. In 1942 she began teaching music theory and composition at the Toronto Royal Conservatory of Music. She joined the music department of the University of British Columbia in 1949. She resigned from her position in 1963 in frustration over the new structures and standards of the department. In her later life Pentland was awarded honorary doctorates from Simon Fraser University in British Columbia and the University of Manitoba, and was named a member of the Order of Canada. In her early compositions Pentland was in the tradition of the late French romantic school. Under the influence of composers such as Aaron Copland, Igor Stravinsky, and Béla Bartók her music became more and more modern in the 1930s. In the 1950s, she introduced serial techniques into her music and continued to experiment with avant-garde techniques. Her final years were spent in ill health preventing her from composing for almost 10 years. Her 1948 entry in the vocal section titled Cities was the last song from a cycle that consisted of five songs: Wheat, Forest, Tracks, Mountains, and Cities.

Her next stop was the 1976 Summer Olympics, where she won a silver medal in the 400 m individual medley, behind Ulrike Tauber, who shattered the world record by over six seconds (Gibson’s performance also broke the world record, but “only” by just under seven-tenths of a second). Tauber was later revealed to have been involved in doping for the majority of her career, and many consider Gibson to have been the true winner of the race. She also placed fifth and sixth in the 100 metre backstroke and the 200 metre butterfly respectively, in addition to being eliminated in the opening round of the 200 metre backstroke. That year she won the Velma Springstead Trophy as Canada’s outstanding female athlete. Gibson’s next major stop was the 1978 Commonwealth Games, where she won the 200 m backstroke and took bronze in the 100 m version and the 400 m individual medley. Later that month she captured bronze in both the 100 and 200 m backstroke events at the World Championships. She followed this up with three silver medals at the 1979 Pan American Games in the 100 and 200 m backstroke events and the 4x100 m medley relay (alongside Gail Amundrud, Nancy Garapick, and the non-Olympian Anne Gagnon). Her final major international tournament was the 1982 Commonwealth Games, where she earned gold in the 4x100 m medley relay (with Michelle MacPherson, Maureen New, and Anne Ottenbrite), silver in the 200 m individual medley, and bronze in the 200 m backstroke. Gibson retired from active competition in 1982, the same year that she graduated from Arizona State University. She became a chartered accountant in 1986 and earned a law degree from the University of Toronto in 1989.

98788,Herschel Walker,Male,3 March 1962,183.0,100, United States,USA,"Herschel Walker is best known for his football exploits. He starred as a running back at the University of Georgia, where he won the Heisman Trophy in 1982. Walker would later be inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1999. Walker played professional football, originally for the New Jersey Generals of the US Football League, playing there for three years (1983-85) but later moved to the NFL where he started with the Dallas Cowboys. But in 1989 he was traded to the Minnesota Vikings, who gave up five players and six draft choices for him. He later played for the Philadelphia Eagles and New York Giants. In the NFL Walker recorded 8,225 rushing yards, 4,859 receiving yards, and 5,084 kickoff-return yards. Adding in his numbers from the USFL he had 13,787 rushing yards which would place him in the top 10 among all-time NFL running backs. Despite missing time because of the USFL career, he is still ranked in the top 10 all-time in the NFL in all-purpose yardage gained. Walker was known for his training regimen and his physical fitness. It did not include lifting weights, but he would often do 1,500 push-ups and 2,500 sit-ups daily. He also competed as a track athlete at Georgia, running 100 metres in 10.22 and in high school was Georgia State Champion as a sprinter and discus thrower. In 2007 Walker announced that he was going to begin a career in mixed martial arts with his first professional competition due to occur in 2010. His US Olympic bobsled appearance was a sidelight of an otherwise stellar sports and athletic career. He was recruited to compete in the sport because of his speed and strength which made him an excellent pusher. In 2022 Walker ran for the US Senate for Georgia on the Republican ticket after being encouraged to run by former President Donald Trump.","Listed in Olympians Who Played in the NFL (Dallas Cowboys (1986-89), Minnesota Vikings (1989-91), Philadelphia Eagles (1992-94), New York Giants (1995)) Listed in Olympians Who Competed in Mixed Martial Arts (MMA) Fighting ()"

His first major tournament was the 1988 Summer Olympics, where he finished seventh in the 200 metres breaststroke. He captured bronze in the event at the 1989 Pan Pacific Championships, as well as silver in the 4x100 m medley relay, and placed fourth in the 100 metres breaststroke. He was fourth again in the 100 m at the 1990 Commonwealth Games, but took gold in the 200 m and the 4x100 m relay alongside Marcel Gery, Tom Ponting, and Mark Tewksbury. The quartet earned silver in this event at the 1991 Pan Pacific Championships (with the assistance of Stephen Clarke), but finished fourth in that year’s World Championships. Cleveland, meanwhile, was fifth in both the 100 and 200 m at the former tournament, and eleventh in the 50 m breaststroke and eighteenth in the 200 m at the latter. His individual fortunes did not improve at the 1992 Summer Olympics, where he finished 13th and 14th in the 100 and 200 m respectively, but his 4x100 m relay squad (again with Clarke) won the bronze medal. Along with Ponting, Tewksbury, and Stephen Vandermeulen, he also set a world record in the 4x100 m relay that year. Cleveland was less successful in 1993, placing sixth and eighth in the 4x100 m relay and the 200 m respectively at the World Short Course Championships, and second, fourth, and fourth in the 200 m, 100 m, and 4x100 m relay at the Pan Pacific Championships. In 1994 he was 10th, 11th, and 12th in the 4x100 m relay, the 100 m, and the 200 m at the World Championships, but captured three medals at Commonwealth Games: silver in the 4x100 m relay (alongside Clarke, Rob Braknis, and Chris Renaud) and bronze in the 100 and 200 m breaststroke. At the 1995 Pan American Games he captured silver in the 100 m, bronze in the 4x100 m relay, and finished fifth in the 200 m. In his final major international tournament, the 1996 Summer Olympics, he was 23rd in the 100 m, 15th in the 200 m, and 12th in the 4x100 m relay (with Braknis, Clarke, and Eddie Parenti).

In the lead-up to the Olympic trials he won the event at the 1948 Canadian National Championships, and his victory at the trials themselves earned him the right to represent Canada in the high jump at the 1948 Summer Olympics, where he placed 6th in a field of 27 competitors. He was victorious again at the 1949 National Championships and the trials for the British Empire Games, but finished tenth in the high jump at the 1950 edition of that tournament. Although he won the event at the 1950 National Championships, his performance was described as “mediocre” by the Ottawa Citizen, as it was three inches short of the national record at the time (and half an inch short of his winning height from the previous year).

It was a symphonic poem which was first performed during the Olympics by the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra, directed by the author. Liviabella was an Italian composer, pianist and professor. He was descended from a musical family. His paternal grandfather Livio was a pupil of Rossini, and master of the Choir of the Basilica of St. Nicholas of Tolentino. Liviabella’s father, Orestes, was a graduate of the Royal Academy of St. Cecilia in Rome, and was the organist and director of the Chapel music of the Cathedral of Macerata.

Fox studied medicine at Pembroke College, Cambridge and, although never selected for the Oxford-Cambridge race, began to gain a reputation as one of the country’s top performers. His breakthrough year was in 1951 when he completed a treble of victories in Britain’s most prestigious races, namely the Diamond Sculls at Henley, the Wingfield Cup and the London Cup as well as winning the silver medal at the European Championships behind Erik Larsen. Fox’s progress to the final of the Helsinki Olympics was impressive as he posted decisive victories in both heat and semi-final but he could not reproduce these performances in the final and placed fourth. He regained his Diamond Sculls title in 1953 but placed outside the medal positions at the European Championship and the following year took a surprise victory at Henley, in partnership with Tony Marsden, over the Soviet double sculls pairing that had won the silver medal at Helsinki. Tipped to win a medal at the 1956 Olympics he failed to reach the final and after completing his medical studies he ended his rowing career. Fox returned to his home island to join his father and brother in their medical practice on Guernsey. After thirty years as a doctor he retired in 1989.",

In his first year at the Shimane Normal School his talent was discovered by Olympian Sasago Tani. While Yoshioka attended the Tokyo Higher Normal School, in 1930 he was the first Japanese player to win the 100 metres at the Far Eastern Games. Later that year he set a national record with 10.7 in a competition in Keijo (now Seoul). Within one year, the record was bettered, first by Chuhei Nanbu and again by Yoshioka to 10.5. At the 1932 Olympics, Yoshioka reached the final in the 100 metres, the last Japanese to do so in a sprint event until 1992. A particularly fast starter, he was nicknamed “Dawn super express” as compared to winner Eddie Tolan’s “Midnight super express”. In 1933, Yoshioka improved the Japanese record to 10.4 and in June 1935 he even tied the world record of 10.3. Although he was considered one of the favorites, Yoshioka was eliminated in round two, after which he fell into a deep depression but managed to return to the track. In 1938-40 he took three more 100 metre national titles in 1931, 1932, and 1935, also winning 4x100 relay titles in 1931 and 1938. In 1941, Yoshioka was appointed professor at the Hiroshima Higher Normal School, where he was about 10 km from the epicentre of the atomic bomb blast, but he survived. After World War II, he worked for the Hiroshima Prefectural Board of Education, organized the 1950 National Athletic Meet, and acted as the first coach of the Hiroshima Carp. He returned to the track scene, coaching the athletic team of the Riccar sewing machine company with a number of Olympians. After the Tokyo Olympic Games, he became a professor at the Tokyo Women’s College of Physical Education in 1970. At the age of 70, he still recorded a time of 15 sec competing at Masters athletic meetings. Shortly after he was hospitalized in 1983 after tearing his Achilles’ tendon, stomach cancer was discovered from which he eventually died at the Tokyo Fuchu Hospital. In his home prefecture, athletic meets are still held bearing his name. Personal Bests: 100 – 10.3 (1935); 200 – 21.2s (1933).",

Richmond also had the distinction of being the first Englishman to win a Commonwealth Games wrestling gold medal, when he won the heavyweight title in 1954. He had won the bronze medal four years earlier. Richmond was brought up close to the Pinewood studios of the J. Arthur Rank Organisation; consequently movies were always in his blood, and in the mid-1940s he was an extra in two big movies of the day: Henry V and Blithe Spirit. Ironically, in the mid-1950s, Richmond became the fourth man to bang the gong at the start of the Rank films. He revealed shortly before his death that the gong was, in fact, made from papier-mâché and was only a stage prop. At school, Richmond was more interested in judo, and only took up wrestling in the late-1940s. In 1948 he lost in the heavyweight final of the Southern Area Championships to Fred Oberlander, who had been undefeated since 1939. Richmond’s performance won him selection for the Greco-Roman light-heavyweight division at the London Olympics, where he finished a commendable fifth. In 1949 Richmond won both the British and Irish freestyle heavyweight titles. He went on to win nine more British heavyweight titles, in 1950, 1952-56 and 1958-60. He was also the dual light-heavy and heavyweight champion in 1950. He competed in four Olympics, 1948-60, and three Commonwealth Games 1950-58. Despite his love of wrestling, Ken Richmond was a dedicated pacifist and towards the end of World War II, served time in prison as a conscientious objector. After the war he spent nine months in Antarctica aboard a whaling ship, and on his return to Britain, started getting walk-on parts in the movies, but his life was to change completely in the late 1960s when he became a Jehovah’s Witness. He spent two years in Malta as a missionary, and on his return, travelled around Britain as district overseer for the movement, and to make ends meet, took a variety of jobs, including window cleaning. In later life, Richmond became an excellent windsurfer, and was still winning medals and trophies into his late-sixties. He was still active in his mid-seventies, when only a bad car accident in 2001 curtailed him.",Listed in Olympians Who Acted in Movies (The Iron Petticoat; Mad About Men; Fast and Loose; Night and the City) Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the British Empire/Commonwealth Games (1–0–1 1950 Auckland WRE bronze: freestyle heavyweight +87 kg (competed for England); 1954 Vancouver WRE gold: freestyle heavyweight +87 kg (competed for England))

The pair of them both ended up playing for their father’s club. Maurice was twice the top scorer in the Belgian first division before World War I and the first time, in 1912, when he scored 33 goals, he was just 17 years of age and was the youngest top scorer in the Belgian League until 2010 when Romelu Lukaku topped the scoring list at the age of 16 years and 10 months. In just over 150 games for Racing Club, Maurice scored 150 goals. He was forced to leave Belgium dramatically in 1914 after the German occupation and Bunyan left with his father and brothers Charles and Ernest. Within 36 hours of returning to England the four men signed up to serve their country, with Maurice joining The Royal Marine Light Infantry. Whilst back in England he was on the books of Chelsea when selected for the 1920 Great Britain Olympic squad despite not having won an England amateur cap. Upon returning to the Continent, Maurice turned professional with the French club Stade Francais and played for them between 1923-27. He later became a qualified referee and coach and was manager of FC Bordeaux between 1945-47. He wrote several coaching manuals and books including Le Football Simplifié in 1934 with a foreword by Jules Rimet. Bunyan’s father was also a well known footballer who played for many English teams and after a brief spell coaching at Newcastle United he moved to the continent to become the football and cricket coach at Racing Club in 1909. He also had a spell coaching in Sweden and was responsible for preparing the Swedish national side in preparation for the 1912 Olympics before returning to Belgium when he later coached one of the country’s top sides Anderlecht He was their coach when he died in 1922. Charles senior’s greatest claim to fame was on 15 October 1887 when he played in goal for Hyde United in the FA Cup tie against Preston North End which established an English record 26-0 scoreline. Bunyan was Hyde’s man-of-the-match, and had it not been for his performance, the score would have been greater.","Son of Charlie Bunyan, Sr."

She took up the javelin at the age of 11 and was eventually adopted by Margaret Whitbread, a former javelin thrower turned national javelin coach, and her husband. Whitbread became European Junior Champion in 1979 and was chosen for the Moscow Olympics whilst still a teenager. After winning a bronze medal at the 1982 Commonwealth Games she broke through into the top echelon of throwers at the 1983 World Championships. She led the competition until the very last throw from home favourite Tiina Lillak. She had a famous, and occasionally bitter, rivalry with compatriot Tessa Sanderson and both women reached the podium at the 1984 Olympic Games. On this occasion it was Sanderson who took the Olympic title and Whitbread who had to be content with the bronze medal. After placing second behind Sanderson at the Commonwealth Games of 1986 Whitbread set a world record in qualifying for the 1986 European Championships in Athens and went on to clinch both that event and win the following year’s World Championships. Whitbread was slightly below par at the 1988 Olympics and finished in silver medal position with a throw four metres less than that of Petra Felke. A chronic shoulder injury ruined her career from that point on and, after a failed attempt at a comeback in 1992, she retired from the sport. She was married to athletics agent and promoter Andy Norman from 1997 until his death in 2007. Whitbread was voted Britain’s Sports Personality of the year in 1987.

In 1914 he sprang a surprise by finishing a close second to the American Homer Baker in the 880 yards at the AAA Championships. After serving in France as a signalman with the Royal Flying Corps, Hill won both the 880 yards and the mile at the first post-war AAA Championships in 1919 and then in August he equaled Joe Binks’ British mile record of 4:16.8 seconds when he finished second in a handicap race at Glasgow. At the 1920 AAA Championships, Hill’s Olympic aspirations received a setback when, having decided not to defend his mile title in order to concentrate on the 880 yards, he was beaten by the South African Bevil Rudd. The reaction of the British selectors was that Hill was too old to attempt the mid-distance double at the Olympics. After a vehement dispute with AAA Secretary Sir Harry Barclay, Hill won his case and with a determination to prove himself he set off for Antwerp. After a hazardous Channel Crossing, and perturbed by the inadequate accommodation, a rather bewildered Hill arrived at the stadium by lorry for the heats of the 800 metres. To add to his troubles, he found that the Belgian organizers had put all the star runners in one heat – in order, as they put it, “to give the also-rans a chance”. Despite all the problems, Hill survived the heats and the semi-finals and after a great race he won the gold medal in the final with a new British record of 1:53.4 seconds. Two days later Hill concluded a magnificent double by winning the 1,500 metres, and he then won a silver in the 3000 metres race in which he himself finished seventh. Hill, at 31, was the oldest runner to win either the Olympic 800 or 1,500 metres and his confidence and own ability was well justified. He closed his long track career at the 1921 AAA Championships when he won the mile in 4:13.8 seconds, which improved his own British record by three seconds and was less than one second outside the world record. Hill, who had been trained by Sam Mussabine and Walter George, became a coach himself on retirement and was the mentor of another outstanding miler, Sydney Wooderson. Shortly before World War II, Hill made his home in Canada, where he died some 30 years later.

67160,Paco Aritmendi,Male,17 September 1938,157.0,53, Spain,ESP,"At the Leapardstown race track, Dublin, in 1964, Paco Aritmendi made history as the first Spaniard to win the International Cross Country Championship (now the World Cross Country Championship). He crossed the line ahead of three Englishmen, Ron Hill, John Cooke and Gerry North and, at the time of his death in 2020, Aritmendi remained the only Spaniard to win the title. Aritmendi started his career as a successful junior athlete before graduating to the athletics section of Real Madrid. While doing military service in Zaragoza in 1962, he competed in his first International Cross Country Championships, finishing 33rd, but did win silver in the team competition. After completing his military service Aritmendi joined the athletic section of Barcelona FC and in 1963 was runner-up to Mariano Haro in the Spanish Cross Country Championships. The following year, however, was the greatest of Aritmendi’s career. It started with him winning the first of two consecutive Spanish cross country titles, followed by that world title and then an Olympic appearance. Unfortunately, he only finished fourth in his 5,000 metres heat in Tokyo and missed out on a place in the final. Also in 1964, at Berlin, Aritmendi became the first Spaniard to run the 5,000 in under 14 minutes (13:53.4). Aritmendi retained his national cross country title in 1965 and also set a Spanish 3,000 metres record of 8:22.2 on the wooden indoor track at Madrid. In addition to his two national cross country titles, Aritmendi won a third national title, at 10,000 metres in 1966. Disappointed with Barcelona, he then joined their rivals RCD Español in 1967 before eventually retiring from the sport at the age of 29. He represented Spain internationally on 14 occasions between 1962-68. After retiring, Aritmendi worked as a bricklayer and gardener to support his wife and family, and during a period of hardship was forced to sell his world championship gold medal. A street in Guadalajara, where Aritmendi lived for many years, was named in his honour and called Paseo de Francisco Aritmendi. Also, in 2010, his hometown of Málaga del Fresno named the municipal sports complex in his honour. In 1997 he received the gold medal for sports merit from the community board of Castiila-la Mancha and in 2007 received the bronze Order of Sports Merit, one of the highest awards in Spanish sport. After his 1964 triumph in Dublin, the Spanish National Sports Delegate José Antonio Elola-Olaso, promised Aritmendi he would be given a house following the victory. When General Franco received Aritmendi at a reception in Madrid, the athlete did not hesitate asking the dictator: “When will I get the house?” He did not get a reply.

By the time she graduated in 1985, however, she had earned a Bachelor’s Degree in Physical Education and had a provincial junior curling championship to her name that she had earned in her senior year of high school. She moved to Regina, Saskatchewan and began working at the North West Leisure Center. Two years later she had won a provincial senior curling championship and, with Joan McCusker, Jan Betker and Marcia Gudereit, took the Canadian Women’s Curling Championship (known as the Scotties Tournament of Hearts) in 1993. This earned them the right to represent Canada at that year’s World Curling Championships, where they defeated the German rink (team) to win the gold medal. She repeated this feat the following year, becoming the first Canadian rink to win consecutive World Championships. In 1997 the team pulled it off yet again, winning not only their third Canadian and World Championships, but also their third ranking as “Team of the Year” by Saskatchewan sport. Her team was also awarded honorary Doctor of Laws degrees from the University of Regina. In 1998, Schmirler’s rink edged out Shannon Kleibrink’s to earn the right to represent Canada at that year’s Winter Olympics, where curling was being officially contested for the first time since 1924. After their gold medal victory against a field of tough competitors, the rink earned the title of “Team of the Year” from the Canadian Press and its members were inducted into the Curling Hall of Fame in 1999. The team lost that year’s Canadian Championships in the semi-finals and Schmirler worked with CBC as a color analyst for the final match. After the birth of her second daughter 1999, Schmirler began experiencing severe health problems and doctors discovered a cancerous tumour near her heart. She nearly died during the operation to remove it when a dead piece broke off and released a blood clot in her lungs, stopping her heart. She was soon thereafter diagnosed with metastatic adenocarcinoma. She continued working as a commentator during her treatment, but in early 2000 it was discovered that the cancer had spread to her lungs and she died soon after, in March. Her funeral was broadcast live by TSN and CBC, the first time a Canadian athlete’s funeral had been televised live by more than one network. After her death she became the Saskatchewan Order of Merit’s first posthumous recipient and was inducted into the Canadian Sports Hall of Fame. The city of Regina renamed the South East Leisure Center in her honor, as well as the road leading up to her curling club. Biggar, Saskatchewan, the city of birth, constructed the Sandra Schmirler Olympic Gold Park and completed it in August of 2000 and, since February of 2001, the Sandra Schmirler Foundation has helped raised funds for infants with medical crises. In 2009, nearly a decade after her death, she was honored with that year’s World Curling Freytag, which recognizes exceptional achievement in the sport.",Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the World Curling Championships (3–0–0 1993 Genève gold: team; 1994 Oberstdorf gold: team; 1997 Bern gold: team)

Initially, he lived with his family in Padua and then attended the art academy in Venezia after 1922. From 1926 he studied at the Academy of Arts in Roma and in Paris with Auguste Rodin, and belonged to the modern movement of the Roman School. In 1931, he was the co-founder of the short-lived magazine “Fronte” and illustrated the famous Canti Orfici (Orphic Songs) of the poet Dino Campana. After a few years as a gravestone sculptor in his father’s company, he returned to Roma and took up a professorship. At the beginning of World War II, the expressionistic style of his small sculpture brought him into opposition against the ruling fascist regime. The experiences of war and resistance were also reflected in his works of art. While teaching at the Art Academy in Napoli, Mazzacurati received the National Prize for Sculpture in the 1960s. His sculptures are characterized by a high physical presence with a penchant for grotesque figures. He experimented with metal, stone, wood and ceramics. He also created memorials to the heroes of the resistance in Parma, Napoli, Roma and other Italian cities. His Lottatori (Wrestlers), which he submitted to the Olympic art competitions, marked the start of a new phase of his sculptural work of a crude realism in 1940. Two versions from the series with this title were exhibited in London. One 57 cm high bronze figure from 1940 is today in the Chamber of Deputies in Rome.",

They asked Mark Zuckerberg to join them and help expand the site to other colleges. Zuckerberg made this wildly successful, as ConnectU was the forerunner of Facebook. The four had an oral agreement about how they would split the profits. The Winklevosses were eventually bought out by Zuckerberg for $59 million, after they sued him for breaking their oral contract. But they filed a further suit seeking more money. In March 2011 that suit came to trial with the judge finding against the Winklevosses in April 2011. In total, the Winklevoss twins received $65 million from Zuckerberg in one of the most famous legal battles in history. They invested $11 million in Bitcoin, and as their value rose from $120 per coin to $10,000 in 2017, so did the twins’ investment, to over $1.3 billion. The twins were the subject of a 2019 book by Ben Mezrich, entitled “Bitcoin Billionaires”.","Twin brother of Tyler Winklevoss Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the Summer Pan American Games (1–1–0 2007 Rio de Janeiro ROW gold: eights, silver: coxless fours) Listed in Olympians Who Competed in the Boat Race (2010 Oxford (lost)) Listed in Olympians With a Net Worth > $100M ($0.9-1.1B (Forbes, 2018))"

69245,Eric Liddell,Male,16 January 1902,173.0,68, Great Britain,GBR,"After showing brilliant promise as an all-round sportsman at Elthiam College, Eric Liddell won international honors at rugby football and athletics when he went up to Edinburgh University. Born in China in the aftermath of the Boxer rising, Liddell first entered the Scottish Championships as a 19-year-old in 1921 and scored the first of his five successive victories in the 100 yards and the 200 yards and the 220 yards. He also won the 440 yards in 1924 and 1925. At the AAA Championships, Liddell won the 100 yards and 200 yards in 1923 and the 440 yards in 1924. His time of 9.7 seconds for 100 yards in 1923 stood as a British record for 35 years. Liddell won seven caps on the wing for Scotland, the first of which came against France at the Stade Colombes which was also the venue for his Olympic triumph, and scored four tries for his country. He gave up rugby for 1923-24 season in order to concentrate on his Olympic preparation. He opened the 1924 track season with a brief visit to America in April, where he finished second in the 200 yards and fourth in the 100 yards at the Penn Relays. When the program was announced for the Paris Olympic Games, Liddell immediately forsook any idea of running the 100 metres as the preliminaries were scheduled to be held on a Sunday. Following this decision, he naturally chose to use the AAA Championships as a final tune-up for the two events on which he had set his adjusted Olympic sights. He won the 440 yards, finished second behind the South African Howard Kinsman in the 220 yards and then went to Paris for the Olympic Games. After wining a bronze medal in the 200 metres, he improved his personal best by more than one second in the semi-finals of the 400 metres. In a classic final, Liddell, drawn in the outside lane, set a devastating pace, which with head back and arms flailing he somehow managed to maintain to the tape, coming home in 47.6 seconds for a new Olympic, European and British record. Back at Stamford Bridge after the Games for the British Empire vs. USA match, Liddell again ran inside 48 seconds as he made up six yards on the Olympic silver medalist Horatio Fitch in the 4×440 yards relay. After the 1924 track season, Liddell spent an increasing amount of time on his religious duties and after winning three events in the 1925 Scottish Championships he returned to China to join his father as a missionary. He did not give up athletics completely and in 1929 at a meeting in Tientsin, he ran 49.1 seconds to beat the celebrated German runner Otto Peltzer over 400 metres. Peltzer pressed Liddell to train for the 800 metres at the 1932 Olympic Games, but Liddell ran his last race in 1930 when he won the North China Championship. Over the next decade, Liddell devoted all his energies to the Church and became a legend in the London Missionary Society, but in March 1943 he was interned in a Japanese concentration camp. The privations suffered in camp took their toll of even the fittest and Eric Liddell died in captivity at the age of 43. Although partly fictionalized, the film Chariots of Fire is a fitting tribute to this remarkable man.

In 1953 he was awarded the Federal Republic’s Cross of Merit. In the park “Bornheimer Hang”, a slope trail is named after him.

For the 1932 Olympic Arts Competitions, he and his colleague Ernst Balser submitted their design for the stadium in Vienna. Their plan, however, was never realized, and the stadium was constructed following the plans of Otto Ernst Schweizer. Max Bromme commenced his professional training in his father’s tree-nursery in 1893. After his military service he studied at the Royal Gardening School in Wildpark near Potsdam from 1901-04.

She first became interested in gymnastics shortly before World War II and her training began at the well-known Jewish VAC Club of Budapest. She quickly became a top young gymnast, but her career was interrupted by World War II. During the war, her father was removed to Auschwitz, where he was killed by the Nazis. Ágnes Keleti and the rest of her family survived by finding refuge in a “Swedish House” administered by Raoul Wallenberg, who became quite famous for assisting Jews to escape from concentration camps. After World War II, Keleti returned to gymnastics and won her first Hungarian championship in 1946, on the uneven parallel bars. In 1947, she made her first international impact when she dominated the Central European Gymnastics Championships. After the War, she initially earned her living as a fur worker, but she was later a demonstrator at the Faculty of Gymnastics of the Budapest School for Physical Culture. Keleti was also an accomplished musician, playing the cello, and she played professionally. After serving as an alternate in 1948, Keleti competed in the 1952 and 1956 Olympic Games, at which she won 10 medals, including five gold. At the 1954 World Gymnastics Championships she won the uneven parallel bars, for her only individual world title, and also was on the winning Hungarian team in the team portable apparatus event. Keleti won four medals at the 1952 Olympics in Helsinki, including an individual gold in the floor exercises. But her greatest gymnastics effort came at the 1956 Melbourne Olympics when she won six medals, including four gold. In the individual apparatus finals, she won the balance beam, floor exercises, and the uneven parallel bars. A poor performance in the horse vault, where she finished 23rd, cost her the all-around individual gold, at which she finished second to the Soviet Union’s Larisa Latynina. Keleti also won gold as part of the Hungarian team in the portable apparatus event. But despite her success in Melbourne, politics had again interceded in her career. In late October, Israel invaded Egypt’s Sinai Peninsula, and then shortly before the 1956 Olympics, on 4 November 1956, Soviet tanks entered Budapest to quell an uprising there. The two events led to a small boycott of the Olympics. Although Hungary competed, many of its athletes defected, and Keleti was among them. She stayed in Australia and then settled in Israel, where she taught physical education at the Orde Wingate Institute and later became the national women’s gymnastics coach.","Wife (divorced) of István Sárkány Listed in Olympic Games Defectors (Did not return to Hungary after 1956 Olympics, first settling in Australia, then Israel.)

He repaid the coaches’ trust in him with an excellent performance, placing sixth in the final of the 200 breaststroke and also swam in the medley relay, which finished fifth. Lalle overtook his Italian rival Giancarlo Mauro in 1975 and was the undisputed top Italian specialist until the end of the 1970s. He won a total of 23 national titles and improved the Italian record for the 100 breaststroke eight times and the 200 metre breaststroke 11 times.

At the age of 12 Olsen attended her local fencing hall and became one Denmark’s best fencers. Olsen competed in the individual foil event at the 1932 Los Angeles Olympics, where she finished in eighth place. Olsen was the Danish champion in foil fencing from 1933–38 and was part of the team that won the European championship in 1933. Three years later Olsen competed at the 1936 Berlin Olympics reaching the quarter-finals. Following World War II Olsen won gold at the 1947 and 1948 World Fencing Championships in the team foil event. She made her third and final Olympic appearance at the 1948 London Olympics. Olsen quit fencing once electrical judging had been introduced into the sport. From 1935–39 and 1946–50 Olsen was on the board of the Academic Fencing Club. In 1931 Olsen began her studies in medicine and became a doctor from the University of København in 1939. Olsen wanted to become a plastic surgeon but the specialty did not exist in Denmark at the time. During the Finnish-Russian war in 1941 Olsen got a job in a Finnish hospital and then went to work at the Karolinska Hospital in Stockholm with a plastic surgeon. Olsen’s plan was to work in England, which was difficult after England had declared war on Finland during 1941. The following year Olsen gained permission to travel to the Faroe Islands via Scotland. On arrival in Scotland, Olsen got off the plane with no intention of leaving. She applied for a residence permit but it was initially rejected by the Danish embassy. After help from some English friends Olsen was allowed to work at a military hospital in the south of England. She worked with patients with severe burns and war injuries before having full responsibility for a department from August 1944 to December 1945. After World War II Olsen returned to Denmark and started working at Rigshospitalet teaching hospital in København. After a disappointing experience due to what Olsen perceived as a “German-inspired, male chauvinistic attitude” she set up her own clinic in København. From 1947–51 Olsen also worked as a plastic surgery consultant in a Belgian hospital. From there Olsen was employed by the Finsen Institute, which allowed her to perform reconstructive plastic surgery on cancer patients. In 1949 Olsen became the first person in Denmark to operate on a malignant mole. Within 10 years Olsen had set up the first the first plastic surgery department in a Danish hospital. Olsen’s work in skin cancer reduced the mortality rate by 40%. Olsen was the co-founder of the Scandinavian Association of Plastic Surgeons.

He finished third in the 1910 IC4A mile for Brown and, after giving track a miss in 1911, his early season form in 1912 augured well for his Olympic chances. One week after dead-heating with John Paul Jones for the 1911 IC4A mile title, Taber pushed Abel Kiviat to a world 1,500 m record at the Final Trials and, with an estimated 3:56.4, Taber was himself inside the old record. In the Olympic 1,500 m the U.S. provided seven of the 14 finalists, but none of them could match the home stretch drive of Arnold Jackson of Britain and Taber lost second place to Kiviat in a photo-finish. At the end of 1913, Taber went to Oxford on a Rhodes Scholarship, but failed to make any impact on the sport in Britain. He was, however, on the Oxford team for the 4×one-mile relay at the 1914 Penn Relays where he ran a disastrous leg, having been up the previous night getting engaged. Taber’s final year in track was 1915 and in a paced trial at Harvard he ran the 1,500 m in 3:55.0 and went on to reach the mile in 4:12.6. Both times were world records and his mile time beat Walter George’s record of 4:12¾, which had been set five years before Taber was born. Despite objections to his use of pacemakers in the race, the IAAF ratified the time as the official mile record. After graduation, Taber established himself as an expert on municipal finance and he formed his own company which specialized in this field. He assisted with the development of President Truman’s Marshall Plan. Taber later became a Life Trustee of Brown University.

69093,Cecil Griffiths,Male,18 February 1900,,, Great Britain,GBR,"Although illness forced him to withdraw from the individual 400 metres at the 1920 Olympics, he ran a brilliant opening leg in the 4×400 metre relay, handing over to Robert Lindsay well clear of the rest of the field. This enabled Britain to avoid the melee involving Sweden, South Africa, France and the USA at the first change-over and the team went on to a comfortable victory. Cecil Griffiths finished third in the AAA 440 yards three times but in 1922 he decided to concentrate on the half-mile and developed into a remarkably consistent performer. From 1922 to 1927 he never finished out of the first three at the AAA Championships, winning the title in 1923 and 1925. This record, when taken with his earlier performance at 440 yards, meant that he was placed in an AAA Championship event for nine successive years. Griffiths’ great race was at the 1926 AAA Championships when the German Otto Peltzer and Douglas Lowe both beat James “Ted” Meredith’s world record of 1:52.2 seconds. Griffiths finished a commendable but almost unnoticed third in an estimated 1:53.4 seconds which, had it not been for Lowe finishing ahead of him, would have been the fastest half-mile ever run by a British athlete.

Bertha Krupp was an heir to the well-known Krupp family business, Friedrich Krupp AG Hoesch-Krupp, the largest company in Europe before World War II. Alfried Krupp studied metallurgy at several German universities, earning a Master’s degree from the Aachener Technische Hochschule in 1934, writing a thesis on melting steel in vacuums, and then joined the family business in 1936. The Krupp company was a steel and metal producer that would eventually contribute greatly to the German war effort. In 1931 Alfried Krupp joined the German SS (Schutzstaffel) and became a member of the Nazi Party in 1938. When his father suffered a stroke, Alfried Krupp became head of the firm. Under his leadership, the company used slave labor, often removing Jews from concentration camps to help work in the factories. He worked closely with the SS to obtain slave labor from the concentration camps, and made his employees work in very brutal conditions even when it was obvious that the war was lost. Krupp was German Minister for the War Economy 1943-45. After the war ended, Krupp’s use of slave labor was investigated by the Allied Military Government, and after what was known as the Krupp Trial (technically The United States of America vs. Alfried Krupp, et al.), he was sentenced to 12 years in prison for “crimes against humanity.” He was also required to forfeit much of his property. Krupp was pardoned after three years in prison by John McCloy, America High Commissioner for Germany, and his property was restored. Alfried Krupp resumed control of his family company in 1953. He led the company until his death in 1967 together with his close friend Berthold Beitz, after which it passed to the Alfried Krupp von Bohlen und Halbach Foundation, a philanthropic organization, which remained the majority shareholder into the 21st century, with the company later known as ThyssenKrupp AG, after mergers with other firms.","Listed in Olympians With a Net Worth > $100M ($1B+ (Encyclopedia Brittannica, ""early 1960s"")) Listed in Olympians Who Were Sent to Prison (In 1948 he was sentenced to 12 years for “crimes against humanity”, but pardoned after three years in prison.)"

In 1930 he switched to the then-vacant position of left-back, playing for Guangzhou Police and the SCAA. His heading abilities earned him the nickname “Copper Head” and he became an energetic player both defensively and offensively. Tan scored two goals in the title match against Japan at the 1934 Far Eastern Games. His defensive performance in the 1936 Olympic tournament against Britain was considered as outstanding but, after the Olympics, his star was on the decline. In 1937 he was suspended for one year for repeated foul play. During the war Tan went to Yunnan and joined the Army with the rank of Lieutenant, being responsible for the transport of anti-Japanese goods on the Burma Road. In 1946 he returned to Guangzhou and later moved to Hong Kong with the new Sing Tao club, but struggled with them. One year later he switched to the Kowloon Motor Bus (KMB) club and retired in 1948.

For many years the same Henriquez de Zuberia (as it was then spelled) was considered to have competed in both rugby football and tug-of-war. From a photograph of the rugby team, he was considered to have been the first black Olympian and research traced him to Haiti as Constantin Henriquez. However, photographs of the tug-of-war team exist and no dark-skinned athlete is present. With research aided by the Spanish Olympic historian Fernando Arrechea, it is now felt that Constantin Henriquez, the Haitian, competed only in rugby football, and the tug-of-war competitor was a French national named Francis (or Francisco) Henriquez de Zubiría. Francis Henríquez de Zubiría was born in Paris to Ricardo Carlos Henríquez and Maria Ana Antonia Clemencia de Zubiría y Osse, and was a French citizen until he took Colombian citizenship in January 1917. Henríquez de Zubiría studied medicine and worked at the Colombian embassy in Paris, also serving as a French doctor during World War I.

84745,Jang U-Shik,Male,18 January 1914,,, Japan,JPN,"Korean national Jang U-Shik was a speed skater whose competitive career occurred during the Japanese occupation of Korea, which lasted from 1910 through World War II. He therefore competed internationally as Yushoku Cho, since the government forced Koreans to take on more “Japanese” names, and represented Japan. He drew attention for his performance as a student at Meiji University, placing second in the 10,000 metres and fourth in the 5,000 metres at the 1935 All Japan Speed Skating Championships, and in 1936 was selected for that year’s Winter Olympics in Garmisch-Partenkirchen. There, Jang was joint-27th (with his compatriot Lee Seong-Deok) in the 5,000 metres and 26th in the 10,000 metres. During his trip to Garmisch-Partenkirchen, he also competed at the World Championship in Davos. Further success came in the national championships, when he clinched the titles in the 5,000 metres and 10,000 metres events in 1938, and another one in the 5,000 metres in 1939. In addition, he was student champion in the 1,500 metres in 1935 and in the 5,000 metres in 1939. World War II ended his competitive career and his later life is clouded in uncertainty. Korean sources claim that he returned to Korea and died there in 1971, while Japanese sources list him as living in Tokyo into the 1980s.
