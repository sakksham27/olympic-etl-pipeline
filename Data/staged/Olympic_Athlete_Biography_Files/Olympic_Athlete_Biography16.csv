73780,Nettie Witziers-Timmer,Female,22 July 1923,,, Netherlands,NED,"Nettie Witziers was a very successful relay sprinter. She was a member of the Dutch relay team, breaking the world record in the 4×110 yard in 1944, as well as the 4×200 m record. The latter was also a political statement, as the Netherlands were still occupied by German forces at the time, and the previous record holders were Germany. After the war, Nettie Witziers ran on the relay team that won the European 4×100 m title in 1946, together with Fanny Blankers-Koen, Martha Adema and Gerda van der Kade-Koudijs. Trained by Fanny’s husband Jan Blankers, the girls trained for the 1948 Olympics. In London, they would add a second international title to their tallies, with Xenia Stad-de Jong running for Adema. Their title was notable, not just for being Blankers-Koen’s fourth gold medal, but also because the entire Dutch team consisted of married women with children - a rarity in those days. Due to the dominance of Blankers-Koen, Witziers never won a Dutch title during her career. Personal Bests: 100 – 12.3 (1944); 200 – 25.5 (1946); LJ – 5.56 (1944).",Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the European Athletics Championships (1–0–0 1946 Oslo gold: 4×100 m relay)

She continued her athletics career, competing in the 1972 Paralympic Games in various events in track and field. She then switched to archery, winning the gold in the 1980 Paralympics. She started competing with able-bodied athletes, from her wheelchair. When archery made its only appearance at the Commonwealth Games in 1982, she won the gold medal. Two years later, she became the first paraplegic to compete at the Olympics. Fairhall did not return to the Olympics, but competed twice more in the Paralympic Games, in 1988 and 2000. She retired after the latter event, switching to coaching. She passed away at the age of 61, of an illness related to her disability.","Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the British Empire/Commonwealth Games (1–0–0 1982 Brisbane ARC gold: individual) Listed in Olympians Who Competed in the Paralympics (Competed in 1972, 1980, 1988, and 2000 Summer Paralympics) Listed in Olympians With a Disability (Paraplegic, competed in wheelchair.)"
71975,Riccardo Fortini,Male,3 April 1957,193.0,72, Italy,ITA,"Riccardo Fortini, first of four sons of a night watchman, began to high jump in 1974 with the club Assi Giglio Rosso Firenze under coach Renzo Avogaro. He was among the best talents of Italian athletics but unfortunately his career was very short. After good youth results (improving from 2.00 to 2.16 in 1975), he set a new Italian record with 2.23 during the Toscano regional championships in Livorno on 13 June 1976, at only 19-years-old, clearing on his third attempt. This result took him to the Montréal Olympics but, maybe because of his lack of international experience, he was eliminated in the qualifying round. His Italian record lasted two years until Rodolfo Bergamo cleared 2.24 in July 1978. One year later Fortini had serious health problems (meningitis) and his career ended. He was hired as a keeper by the municipality of Firenze until his death at only 52. Personal Best: HJ – 2.23 (1976).",

26257,Kim Yong-Sik,Male,25 July 1910,172.0,65, Japan  Republic of Korea,JPN,"The son of a church minister, Kim Yong-Sik began playing football at the age of seven. He later attended Kyungshin High School and eventually graduated from Boseong Technical School in 1937. In 1927, he started playing regularly for the Kyungshin school team, reaching the final of the Pyeongyang section of the All Joseon Football Championship. He was dismissed from his school for some time, because he was involved in the Gwangju Student Independence Movement. During this period, Kim was also active as a distance runner and speed skater. In 1933, he joined the newly formed Kyungsung FC, winning the Japanese Emperor’s Cup tournament in Tokyo in 1935, the only time that a club from outside Japan achieved this feat. The dynamic halfback was included in the Japanese football team for the 1936 Olympics in Berlin as the only Korean, under the Japanized name of Yoshoku Kin, and helped Japan upset Sweden in the “miracle of Berlin,” in which Japan came back to win in the second half from two goals down. Beginning in 1937, Kim attended Waseda University in Japan and joined their football team. He only spent one semester at Waseda before returning to his home country of Korea to work as a reporter for the Dong-a Ilbo newspaper. He had to stop playing football but, in 1938, joined the former Boseong All-Stars, made up of the school’s former and present students. In the same year they won the Korean section of the All Japanese Football Championships, but ultimately lost the final against his former team from Waseda University. In 1940, Kim joined Pyeongyang FC as a player-coach accompanied by a number of other Boseong All-Stars team members and played his last international game for Japan at the short lived Japan-dominated East Asian Games. In 1942, he represented the puppet state of Manchuria at these Games. From 1942-45 all regular sporting competitions ceased due to the War. When Korea was liberated from Japanese occupation, Kim rejoined the Boseong All-Stars. One year later he returned to his re-established former club Kyungsung FC, now called Seoul Football Club. A South Korean squad was sent to compete at the 1948 Olympics in London, and Kim was selected to represent his country in both of Korea’s matches. He became player-coach of the Joseon Industries team immediately after the Olympics and remained until the outbreak of the Korean War in 1950. During the war he was a member of several military teams. Kim’s retirement from his active career in 1952 was marked by a special friendly match between the national team and a University selection with Kim as a guest player. He was selected to lead South Korea’s team during their first participation in the FIFA World Cup final in 1954. He was also on the coaching staff when Korea succeeded in the 1960 AFC Asian Cup. Domestically he acted for short periods as manager of Yangzee FC, Trust Bank and Hallelujah FC (later Goyang Zaicro FC). In 1982, Kim returned to Japan with the Christian football team of Hallelujah. He also held various positions in FIFA, the Korean Football Association and became Korea’s first international referee. He was posthumously awarded into the South Korea Order of Sport Merit (Fierce Tiger Medal) in 1985 and was one of the original inductees to South Korea’s Football Hall of Fame. Kim was deemed the father of Korean football after World War II.",

65822,Dot Brookshaw,Female,20 December 1912,,, Canada,CAN,"Dot Brookshaw’s first attempt to represent Canada at the Olympics came in 1932 at the national trials, but she did not make the team. In February 1933 she received an injury to her spine when she was thrown from a car that crashed into a tree, but she recovered quickly enough to participate in that year’s national championships in August and win the 4×100 metre relay alongside Mildred Fizzell and the non-Olympians Peggy Mathieson and Irene Storey. She finished fifth in the 100 metres at the trials for the 1936 Summer Olympics, behind Hilda Cameron, Aileen Meagher, Jeanette Dolson, and the non-Olympian Thelma Norris, but was selected to represent Canada in the 4×100 m relay despite the spots traditionally going to the top four placers. At the Games the Canadians came in second in their opening heat, advancing to the final, but their time of 48.0 was slower than the Britons, the Americans, and the Germans (who set a world record in their heats). In the final, it looked as if the race for gold was between the United States and Germany, but German runner Ilse Dörffeldt dropped the baton, which gave the Americans the top podium spot, the British squad silver, and the Canadians a bronze medal. Brookshaw retired from active competition shortly after the Games. Personal Best: 100 – 12.6 (1936).",
921163,Hernando Ocampo,Male,28 April 1911,,, Philippines,PHI,"Philippine national artist Hernando Ocampo was a fictionist, playwright and editor. Ocampo was a leading radical modernist artist in the Philippines. He was a member of the Saturday Group of artists (also known as the Taza de Oro Group), and was one of the pre-war Thirteen Moderns, a group of modernist artists founded by Victorio C. Edades in 1938. Ocampo originally studied law, economics, and creative writing, and began as an English writer. During the Japanese Occupation, Ocampo turned to writing in Tagalog and wrote plays for the stage, becoming the chief scriptwriter and assistant director of the Associated Artists. The Japanese also appointed him censor for the stage and for the Taliba newspaper, at the same time that he had an intelligence assignment as second lieutenant in Straughn’s Guerrillas. He also became editor of the Manila Sunday Chronicle Magazine and later produced TV productions. Ocampo was particularly renowned for works that addressed the harsh reality of his country after World War II. A large part of his oeuvre, however, also illustrates beautiful Filipino landscapes. His paintings then became increasingly abstract.",

115648,César Cielo Filho,Male,10 January 1987,195.0,80, Brazil,BRA,"After moving to the United States at age 18 to train at Auburn University, César Cielo Filho quickly developed into the world’s fastest freestyle sprinter. He missed out on the podium at the 2007 worlds, but made his mark at the Beijing Olympics, first coming third in the 100 free (in a tie with Jason Lezak), prior to winning the 50 free in a time narrowly outside the world record. At the 2009 World Championships in Rome, he won the sprint double (50 and 100 metres), crowning his performance with a world record in the 100. Cielo’s 46.91 was the first official time under 47 seconds, as Alain Bernard’s earlier 46.94 was not recognized. Later that year, just before the super-fast polyurethane swimming suits were banned, he also lowered the 50 free world record to 20.91. After two more titles at the 2010 short-course championships, Cielo made the news in 2011 due to a failed drug test. In May 2011, he was found to have used furosemide (a diuretic and potential masking agent). Cielo claimed not to have used the substance – or at least not to enhance performance – due to cross-contamination of a caffeine supplement. This explanation, which according to FINA regulations leads to a warning, was confirmed in a ruling by the Court of Arbitration for Sport, amid much confusion and anger from fellow competitors. Seemingly unaffected, Cielo proceed to defend his 50 freestyle title at the 2011 World Championships, while also winning the 50 metre butterfly. Later in the year, he added four golds to his Pan American Games tally, which already had three golds and a silver from 2007.","Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the Summer Pan American Games (7–1–0 2007 Rio de Janeiro SWI gold: 50 m freestyle, 100 m freestyle, and 4×100 m freestyle relay, silver: 4×100 m medley relay; 2011 Guadalajara SWI gold: 50 m freestyle, 100 m freestyle, 4×100 m freestyle relay, and 4×100 m medley relay) Listed in Current World Record Holders in Swimming (50 m freestyle 20.91 (2009)) Listed in Olympians Who Set a World Record in Long Course Swimming (50 m freestyle – 18 December 2009 - present: 20.91 (18 December 2009; São Paulo, BRA); 100 m freestyle – 30 July 2009 - 13 August 2022: 46.91 (30 July 2009; Roma, ITA)) Listed in Olympians Who Set a World Record in Short Course Swimming (4×50 m medley relay – 4 December 2014 - 17 December 2017: 1:30.51 (4 December 2014; Doha, QAT)) Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the Pan Pacific Swimming Championships (1–1–1 2010 Irvine gold: 50 m butterfly, silver: 50 m freestyle, bronze: 100 m freestyle) Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the World Aquatics Championships (6–1–0 2009 Roma SWI gold: 50 m freestyle and 100 m freestyle; 2011 Shanghai SWI gold: 50 m freestyle and 50 m butterfly; 2013 Barcelona SWI gold: 50 m freestyle and 50 m butterfly; 2017 Budapest SWI silver: 4×100 m freestyle relay) Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the World Short-Course Swimming Championships (25 m) (5–1–6 2004 Indianapolis silver: 4×100 m freestyle relay; 2010 Dubai gold: 50 m freestyle and 100 m freestyle, bronze: 4×100 m freestyle relay and 4×100 m medley relay; 2014 Doha gold: 100 m freestyle, 4×50 m medley relay, and 4×100 m medley relay, bronze: 50 m freestyle and 4×50 m freestyle mixed relay; 2018 Hangzhou bronze: 4×100 m freestyle relay and 4×50 m medley relay)"

He was also the Nigerian Greco-Roman champion in 1991 and 1993 and African freestyle champion in 1993 and 1994. These accomplishments earned him the right to represent his country at that year’s Commonwealth Games, held in Victoria, Canada, where he applied for refugee status due to the political situation in his country. He wrestled for Douglas College, and then Simon Fraser University, in British Columbia and was undefeated over 116 matches at the collegiate level through 1999. Along the way he was the Canadian national Greco-Roman welterweight champion in 1997 and, after gaining his citizenship, national freestyle champion in 1998 and fourth in that division at the 1998 World Championships. He gained serious attention in 1999, however, when he took gold and bronze in the category at the World Championships and Pan American Games respectively, in addition to being national champion in both styles of wrestling. He was then selected for Canada’s delegation to the 2000 Summer Olympics, where he defeated Russia’s Arsen Gitinov in the finals to capture the gold medal, the first ever in wrestling for a Canadian. That year he won the Lou Marsh Trophy as Canada’s top athlete. Igali focused on freestyle wrestling for the remainder of his career and was Canadian champion again in 2001 and 2002. Switching to the middleweight division, he earned gold at the 2002 Commonwealth Games and competed at the Summer Olympics in 2004, but was defeated by eventual bronze medalist Iván Fundora of Cuba in the quarter-finals and placed sixth. He retired from active competition after the Games and has been inducted into the British Columbia Sports (2001), Canada’s Sports (2007), the Canadian Olympic (2012), and the International Wrestling Halls of Fame (2012). He was also a successful international kabaddi player, earning the sobriquet “The Michael Jordan of Kabaddi” for his accomplishments, but retired prior to 2000 to concentrate on his training for the Olympics. Igali has been active in many fields since his Olympic victory. In 2002 he established the Daniel Igali Foundation with the goal of opening a school in his native Eniwari in Nigeria, a dream that was realized in 2006.

It was in 1951 that he made his debut as a steeplechaser and he did well to reach the Olympic final the following year. At the 1954 British Empire and Commonwealth Games he competed for England and was eliminated in the heats of the 1 mile event. In 1955 he represented Britain in three of their five international matches, finishing second to John Disley on each occasion, and in 1956 he clinched the place in the Olympic team with a personal best of 8 minutes 47.2 seconds in the match against Czechoslovakia when he was again second to John Disley. With Disley, Brasher, and Eric Shirley all qualifying for the Olympic final, British hopes ran high in Melbourne with Brasher perhaps the least fancied of the three. But from 300 metres out, Brasher launched an unanswerable attack and came home the winner with 12 metres to spare in 8 minutes 41.2 seconds, a new British and Olympic record. However, some hours were to pass before he received his gold medal as he had to survive a protest that he had impeded the Norwegian Ernst Larsen. After the Melbourne Olympics, Chris Brasher retired from athletics and from his job with Mobil Oil to take up the post of Sports Editor of the Observer which had been offered to him before the Games. In 1961 he joined the BBC as a reporter on the Tonight program and in 1969 was appointed head of General Features, Television, but he did not renew his contract in 1972.

Charlie was one of four siblings who went on to become boxers, and followed Tom, Bill, and Fred into the sport. Fred was the most successful of the four, and won successive ABA titles at three different weights, a feat next achieved 65-years later by Joe Calzaghe. Charlie started boxing as a featherweight, first competing in the ABA Championships at that weight as a 17-year-old in 1934. In 1936 he fought as a lightweight, and reached the semi-final before losing to the eventual champion Freddie Simpson. Webster was a reserve for the Berlin Olympics that year and also fought in the match between Great Britain and the USA at Wembley, where he beat a tough opponent in Austin McCann. Also in 1936, Webster fought in two matches between Britain and Germany. Webster eventually won his only ABA title, at welterweight, in 1938 when he stopped George Spears in the third round. Six months after winning the title, Webster turned professional. He kicked off his pro career with a decision over Pat Haley, a seasoned professional with 128 fights behind him. Between then and 1948, Webster had 17 fights with an 11-5-1 record. In the 1960s he ran the Admiral Napier pub in Kentish Town with his wife Rose.",Brother of Fred Webster

He studied at the École des Beaux Arts and the Académie Julian in Paris. He was an excellent portraitist, which is why he was invited to Russia by the Grand Duke Vladimir, uncle of Tsar Nicolas II, to portray Russian officers. In 1908 he took part in a Russian archaeological expedition to Egypt. The son of a general, Villa was an air force pilot during World War I. Back in France he began a new career as an illustrator doing mainly cartoons. He also illustrated books including works by Anatole France, Theophile Gautier, Edgar Allen Poe and Louys Pierre. In the 1920’s Villa was part of the Parisian Année Folles (Crazy Years) and became known for his caricatures and portraits as well as his erotic drawings using charcoal and pastel. Many of Villa’s outstanding illustrations can be found in limited edition collectors’ books, including 12 erotic lithographs to accompany the poetry of Edmond Haraucourt, Poemes hysteriques, an eroticized parody of the poems of Victor Hugo. Georges Villa cut his own copper and stone plates for his engravings. Villa illustrated 26 menus between 1925 and 1964 and painted a “masterpiece” Pierrot postcard for Wague in 1930. He spent most of his life in Montmartre where he was a well-known portrait artist whose subjects included aviation, fencing, gastronomy and aristocratic ladies of the 18th century. Between 1944 and 1946 he did illustrations of Montmartre songs including Avec les lorettes, Mimi Pinson et Pierrot and eventually wrote a novel. Villa was made Knight of the Legion of Honor. His album Haut les masques (Off with the masks) consisted of 2 volumes of 79 and 70 pages, respectively, with caricatures of well-known fencers. Short accompanying lyrics were contributed by Armand Massard and Roger Ducret. The work was printed in a limited edition of 1,000 copies, 100 of which were signed deluxe copies on tinted parchment. The editor was Léon Delevoye, head of the magazine L’Escrime et le Tir in Rouen. Three drawings were exhibited in Paris in 1924, allegedly among them one showing Candido Sassone, an Italian fencing master. His career was interrupted by World War I. In 1925 Sassone went to Argentina and taught fencing with great success.",

They improved to first the following year and also went on to capture the North American Championships, repeating their national title in 1928. Bangs went on to pair with Frances Claudet, with whom he won the Canadian Championship in 1931 and finished runner up in the North American Championship that same year. The duo placed second at the 1932 national championships, behind Bud Wilson and his sister Constance Wilson-Samuel, but this was sufficient to make them part of Canada’s delegation to the 1932 Winter Olympics, where they finished sixth among seven starters. They were also fifth at the World Championships that year. Bangs retired after the Games to focus on his management of the C. W. Bangs Coal Company, a business started by his father. He had originally intended to study law at the University of Toronto, but abandoned this pursuit to join the family business. He attempted a brief comeback in 1934, but returned to retirement following a serious facial injury.

In 2011 he became the first Norwegian to win a world swimming title, taking the 100 breaststroke at the Long-Course Worlds. It was an emotional moment, as the victory came only a few days after the tragic killings in Oslo by Anders Behring Breivik. In April 2012, Dale Oen was training in Flagstaff, Arizona with the Norwegian team and was primed to go for an Olympic gold medal in London.

He was the son of non-Olympians discus thrower Heinz Timmermann and shot putter Doris Vollgraf. During the 1980s Timmermann was among the world’s best shot putters and won Olympic gold in 1988. Four years later in Barcelona he placed fifth. At the 1983 Worlds he won a silver medal and came in fifth in 1987. He won the 1985 and 1989 World Cups as well as European Cups in 1987, 1989 and 1991. At the European Championships he took silver in 1986 and gold in 1990. Indoors, he won the Worlds and the Europeans in 1987 and 1989, adding two more silvers at the Europeans in 1985 and 1990. Timmermann’s greatest opponent was his teammate Udo Beyer. Timmermann won the East German Championships outdoors in 1988-90 (second in 1983-87), and indoors in 1983 and 1985-90. Between 1985 and 1989 he set four world records: indoors with 22.15 (1985) and 22.55 (1989), and outdoors with 22.62 (1985) and 23.06 (1988). His shot put technique was considered pioneering. In 1991 dozens of theses and dissertations by former GDR doping researchers in the Military Medical Academy Bad Saarow were published by Brigitte Berendonk and professor Werner Franke. Based on their work, the state organized GDR practices, which included Ulf Timmermann, were reconstructed. According to this information Timmermann took very high doses of turinabol from 1981-84, but he always denied using anabolic steroids. Timmermann had multiple professions. He trained at a technical school, studying machine construction, and became a construction carpenter. He later studied economics, was employed as a travel agent, owned a pub in Berlin, worked as an independent business consultant, and became director of an industrial bakery company.

He resurfaced five years later and earned another silver medal at the 1991 World Championships with an altered lineup that included future Olympic teammate Don Bartlett as lead. At the 1992 Winter Olympics, where curling was a demonstration sport, Team Kevin Martin represented Canada and placed fourth. Don Walchuk joined the squad in 1995 as third and soon helped them win a trip to the 1997 World Championships, where they placed fourth. Undeterred, they carried their momentum into the 1997 Canadian Curling Trials and finished as runner up behind Mike Harris. Martin’s team then had an unsuccessful season prior to the addition of Carter Rycroft as second 1999. The foursome had a 7-2 record at the 2001 Olympic Trials and earned themselves the right to represent Canada at the 2002 Winter Olympic curling tournament, where they finished with a silver medal as runners up to the Norwegian team. The foursome continued to curl together for several years but, a year after a losing record at the 2005 Olympic Trials, Martin scrapped his team and rebuilt it to great success. This new rink won the 2008 World Championships and fell to second at the 2009 edition in a close final match. Their next stop was the 2009 Olympic trials and they survived to a final showdown against Team Glenn Howard that included, among others, former 1998 Olympian Richard Hart. In the end, Team Martin won the match and was selected to represent Canada at the 2010 Winter Olympics. There, alongside lead Ben Hebert, second Marc Kennedy, and third John Morris, Martin became the first skip to go through an entire Olympic tournament without losing a single match, capturing the gold medal in another final against Norway. When not playing or training he runs The Kevin Martin Curling Academy and Kevin’s Curling Supplies in Edmonton, Alberta. As of 2009 he was won the Alberta provincial championships, now known as the Boston Pizza Cup, on 10 occasions, from 1991-1992, from 1995-1997, in 2000, and from 2006-2009.",Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the World Curling Championships (1–2–0 1991 Winnipeg silver: team; 2008 Grand Forks gold: team; 2009 Moncton silver: team)

His aim was to send the German Swimming Federation to Paris to contest the world’s best. Under the name L’équipe impériale Allemande the German Reich selection went to Paris with Hax as team captain and goalkeeper. In the game Germany against Pupilles de Neptune from Lille, the French proved far superior and led at half-time, 3-0. The German team had a hard struggle, since they had to cope with the international rules for the first time. The popular “ball in hand” tactic was countered by aggressive play by the French. A tactical change at the break helped the Germans score two goals in the second half, while Lille did not score any further, nevertheless they won 3-2. In his Olympic career Hax was also the flagbearer of the 1906 German team and then placed fifth with the German gymnastic team in the all-around.

He died of AIDS in 1987, one of the first Olympians to succumb to that disease. A biography of him was written by Dick Schaap, entitled Gay Olympian. Schaap wrote of him, “He may have been the most impressive human being I ever met. Certainly, he was the most impressive athlete.” Personal Best: Dec – 7675 (1968).",

Müllner worked in a neoclassical style and his extensive work depicted a wide variety of subjects including reliefs, busts, war memorials, etc. corresponding to the needs for representation of the expiring monarchy. He stood up to the Nazis without significant modifications, but Müllner’s art works are today highly controversial because of his support of the Nazi’s in the 1938-45 era. He himself never denied his pro-German feelings. Nevertheless, after World War II he was named an honorary citizen of his birthplace of Baden as well as of Wien.

Although Japan had won all other judo events, the loss of the blue riband open class saddened the hosts. Earlier, Geesink destroyed the myth of Japanese invincibility in judo by becoming the first non-Japanese judoka to win a world title in 1961. Between 1952 and 1967, Geesink won 21 European titles in the open and unlimited classes, and added another World Championship in 1965. He retired after his 1967 European title. Having also competed in wrestling (he attempted to compete in the 1960 Games), Geesink was a professional wrestler in Japan with All-Japan Pro Wrestling in 1973-78. His reputation as a strongman also earned him a small role as Samson in the Italian movie “I grandi condottieri”. In his second career, he was a sport administrator, working for the European and International Judo Federations. He suggested the use of white and blue judogi (suits) to make the sport more attractive for viewers and easier for referees, although abandoning the traditional white met with resistance in Japan. Also a member of the Dutch NOC, he was co-opted into the IOC in 1987. During his membership, he served in several commissions, notably the Sport for All commission. In his role in the 2002 Winter Games Evaluation Commission, the “Friends of Anton Geesink Foundation” was found to have taken $5,000 from the Salt Lake City bid committee. Geesink was reprimanded, but allowed to stay with the IOC, which he did until his death in 2010. In 1997, Geesink became part of the select group of judoka to receive the 10th (and highest) dan, although this honor was bestowed upon him by the International Judo Federation, not the Japanese Kodokan. He was also Dutch athlete of the year on four occasions (1957, 1961, 1964, 1965), one of the inaugural recipients of the Fanny Blankers-Koen Trophy, and he lived a street bearing his own name in his home town Utrecht.","Listed in Olympians Who Acted in Movies (Zoals u wenst, mevrouw; Pipo de Clown; Noord-Zuid... aan-uit!; De grote vriezer; I grandi condottieri; Rififi in Amsterdam) Listed in Members of the International Judo Federation Hall of Fame (Inducted in 2003) Listed in Olympians Who Were Elected Dutch Athlete of the Year (1957, 1961, 1964, 1965) Listed in Olympic Order Recipients (2010 (Silver) (posthumously))"

Strug was a vault specialist, but she landed poorly on her first attempt, and also injured her left ankle.

Strug took the final vault, landed, hopped slightly on her one good leg, but otherwise was clean, and scored a 9.712, clinching the gold medal for the US. Unfortunately, the story was better than the reality. Without Strug taking the final vault, the US would still have won the competition by 0.309 points.

Kenny was defeated by France’s Gregory Bauge in the final of the sprint event at the 2011 World Championships but was elevated to world champion when Bauge had his results annulled for most of 2011 after missing three competition doping tests.

By winning heavyweight titles at both the 1911 World Championships and 1912 Olympic Games, Saarela established himself as the world’s best amateur heavyweight wrestler at the start of the 1910s. Saarela also won Finnish heavyweight titles in 1908 and 1909, but then turned professional after the 1912 Olympics. Saarela’s brief professional career was interrupted by World War I and, after the conflict, he moved back to his family farm and worked the rest of his life as a farmer.

At fencing, Davson reached the final pool of the British Foil Championships six times and was runner-up on three occasions. He also reached the final of the British Épée Championship, and twice visited France with the Great Britain team. He also appeared at the 1908 and 1912 Olympics, winning the épée team silver medal at Stockholm. Davson also enjoyed a successful tennis career that saw him play in the men’s singles at Wimbledon every year from 1907-26, with the exception of 1912, and also the War years when he was a Royal Navy Volunteer Reserve. His best Wimbledon singles result was in reaching the quarter-finals on two occasions. In 1914 he lost in straight sets to Alfred Beamish, and in 1922 he was beaten in four sets by the eventual runner-up Randolph Lycett. Davson won the Covered Courts Championship at Queen’s Club in 1913 and 1919, and was runner-up to Arthur Lowe in their grass court championship in 1914. Also at Queen’s, in 1922, Davson and fellow Briton Theodore Mavrogordato beat Beamish and New Zealander Frank Fisher in five sets to win the doubles title at the World Covered Court Championships. Davson also played Davis Cup tennis for Great Britain in 1919. He played just one game, the qualifying final against France, and he came from behind to win the deciding rubber against William Laurentz to put Britain into the Challenge Round against Australasia. Unfortunately, due to his business commitments as a chartered architect, he was prevented from travelling to Australia for the match.",

He trained and served in Egypt during World War I prior to joining the Winnipeg GTP of the city’s junior hockey league during the 1918-1919 season. When he advanced to the Manitoba Hockey League’s senior division the following year, he suited up with the Winnipeg Falcons and captured the league’s championship trophy, the Allan Cup. This victory allowed the squad to represent Canada at the 1920 Summer Olympic ice hockey tournament, where Johannesson skated defense, scored two goals, and helped bring home the gold medal. During the journey to Antwerp, he and Frank Fredrickson teamed up with another passenger to form a musical trio that held concerts aboard the ship. Johannesson remained with the Falcons until 1924, when he spent one season with the Selkirk Fishermen. From then until his 1929 retirement he skated with several different teams across multiple leagues, never achieving the same success he enjoyed during his earlier days. Although Johannesson did spend one season (1933-1934) as the head coach of the Falcons, his true passion was flying, a love that was fostered in childhood and became a lifelong pursuit following the conclusion of his athletic career. In addition to serving as a Master Flying Instructor of the British Empire, he was a charter member of the Winnipeg Flying Club and helped define the nature of the Canadian federal government’s jurisdiction over aeronautics. In 1949 Johannesson bought land in Manitoba in order to build a landing strip, but was blocked by newly-enacted neighborhood laws that restricted the building of aerodromes. In the 1952 Supreme Court of Canada case Johannesson v. Rural Municipality West St. Paul, it was decided that aeronautics fell within the exclusive domain of the federal government, and that the pursuit of the development of aeronauts trumped local interests and concerns. Johannesson built his landing strip and maintained it until his death in 1968, at which point it was sold and turned into a housing development.",Father-in-law of Roy Williams Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the World Ice Hockey Championships (1–0–0 1920 Antwerpen (Olympics) gold)

Unlike most Olympic champions, Hughes did not turn professional and skate in ice shows, but returned for the 2002-03 season, where she was second at the US Championships and sixth in the Worlds. Hughes then stopped skating, though she never formally retired. She entered Yale in the fall of 2003, and graduated in 2009 with a degree in American studies, but never skated competitively after the 2003 season.",Sister of Emily Hughes Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the World Figure Skating Championships (0–0–1 2001 Vancouver bronze: singles) Listed in Olympians Who Were Awarded the James E.

His greatest achievement came in 1995 when he won the Vuelta à España and also won the mountains classification and points classification. This made him only the second cyclist to have won all three major jerseys in the same grand tour, after Eddy Merckx in the 1969 Tour de France. Primarily a sprinter early in his career, Jalabert won the points classification at all three grand tours, a feat equaled only by Merckx and Dzhamolidin Abduzhaparov. Jalabert ranked first in the world in the UCI Rankings in 1995-97 and 1999, placing second in 1998. After a severe accident late in 1994, Jalabert re-made himself, improving his climbing ability and becoming a top attacker. Jalabert’s list of palmarès is extensive. He won 25 stages in the grand tours – 18 in the Vuelta à España, three at the Giro d’Italia, and four in the Tour de France, but two of those, in 1995 and 2001, came on Bastille Day, which endeared Jaja to the French fans. He won 10 jerseys in the big tours as follows: Tour – 1992/95 points and 2001 mountains; Giro – 1999 points; Vuelta – 1995 general, 1994-97 points, and 1995 mountains. Jalabert won the 1997 World Time Trial Championship, and placed second in the World Championship road race in 1992. His other major victories were as follows: Paris-Nice in 1995-97; Tour de Romandie in 1999; Giro di Lombardia in 1997; Milano-Sanremo in 1995; Clásica de San Sebastián in 2001-02; La Flèche Wallonne in 1995 and 1997; Vuelta al País Vasco in 1999; and the Volta à Catalunya in 1995. After retiring in 2002, Jalabert became a consultant to Look cycles and a television commentator. He also started competing in Ironman triathlons, placing 76th in the Ironman World Championship in 2007.",

At his first Soviet Championships, Kosichkin won the 5,000 metres.

In 1960, Kosichkin did not medal at the European All-Around Championships, but won silver in the 10,000 and a bronze in the 5,000 at the World All-Around Championships, finishing fifth overall. At the 1960 Winter Olympics, Kosichkin gave himself a great birthday gift by winning gold in the 5K, while the silver medal went to his major rival, Knut Johannesen. In the 10,000, two days later, the roles were reversed, with Johannesen winning gold and Kosichkin silver. The next year was very successful for Kosichkin. At first, he won his only Soviet all-around title, then two weeks later won the European All-Around title, also winning the 5,000 and 10K events at those championships. Again two weeks later, Kosichkin was a runner-up at the World All-Around Championships, while winning the 10,000. In 1962, despite being a runner-up at the Soviet All-Around Championships, Kosichkin was not selected for the Soviet European Championships team, but won the World All-Around Championships. The next season was a disappointment to Kosichkin, as he was only 15th at the Soviet All-Around Championships and did not finish the 10K at the World All-Around Championships. At the 1964 Olympics, Kosichkin finished fourth in the 5,000 and sixth in the 10K, but later won a silver medal at the World All-Around Championships.

Later that year she became an instant hero in her native Scotland by winning the host nation’s only track and field gold of the 1986 Edinburgh Commonwealth Games. She regularly ran at distances between 800 metres and the marathon but it was over the longer distances that she excelled and it was only the sprint finish of Olga Bondarenko that denied her the Olympic 10K title at the Seoul Olympics. After winning the Commonwealth Games 10,000 title in early 1990 McColgan missed most of the year to have her first child but then made a swift and successful comeback in 1991. Within five months of the birth of daughter Eilish she won the bronze medal at the World Cross-Country Championship and then dominated distance running from the rest of the year. She ran away from the field to win the World Championship 10,000 m and then, in November, won the New York Marathon with a record time for a début marathon. The Olympic year of 1992 was a comparative disappointment as she placed only fifth in the Olympic 10 km but she did have the satisfaction of winning both the World Half-Marathon Championships and the Tokyo Marathon. Injury put her out of the sport for nearly two years but she returned to win the London Marathon in spring 1996 and to compete at her third Olympic Games in Atlanta. McColgan placed second at the next two London Marathons but injuries were beginning to blight her career and she retired from the sport in 2001 after failing to recover from a series of stress fractures. She turned to coaching and owned a chain of fitness centres but could not keep away from running and made a comeback in 2004 to win the Scottish cross-country title. Liz was married to steeplechaser Peter McColgan from 1987 to 2011 but the pair split acrimoniously in 2011. She was sent for trial on charges of assault on her husband but was found not guilty of the accusations.

Subsequently, he took over his father’s pharmacy called Zum heiligen Karl. From 1924-39, he worked as a free-lance writer, before he had to return to his original profession as a pharmacist. After the “Anschluss” of Austria he was not allowed to publish, because he was active as a freemason. As a devoted follower of technical innovations, he was an early photographer and motorist. He was involved in the literary circles of his hometown already at a young age and became a close friend of poet and playwright Anton Wildgans. Nature and civilization, religion, culture and history are themes of Mayer’s novels. He described the impacts of technical and medical progress and the resulting psychological problems. As the first writer, Mayer was awarded Honorary Citizenship of the Technical University in Wien (Vienna) in 1949. One of his most popular novels was Rapanui describing the fate of Easter Island. Around 1930, he focused on historical figures from his home country of Austria (Minister Bruck, Königgrätz_). His Sport-novels were published in 1920 in Leipzig. The book contains a total of six stories, all of them with reference to sports: The Angler, Speed, The Curve, The Mountains, Horses and Sports Editor Wallner. Nothing is known about his 1936 entry Chor der Sportsleute.",

50424,Gunnar Larsson,Male,12 May 1951,186.0,86, Sweden,SWE,"Together with Arne Borg, Gunnar Larsson is considered as Sweden’s greatest all-time swimmer. Larsson first competed internationally at the 1968 Olympics, competing in three individual freestyle events and two freestyle relays, but his specialty was the individual medley. At the 1970 European Championships, he won three gold medals – the 400 freestyle and both IMs. His winning times in the 400 freestyle (4:02.6) and 200 IM (2:09.3) were also world records. For those achievements, Larsson was awarded the Svenska Dagbladet Gold Medal. At the 1972 Olympics, American Gary Hall was considered as the favorite for individual medley golds. The 400 IM was contested first and in the final Hall led for the first 300 metres but was overtaken by Larsson and Tim McKee in the freestyle leg and they finished almost simultaneously, the electronic timing giving both the time of 4:31.98. However, the electronic timer could measure to the 1/1000ths of a second and when that was done, Larsson had the gold medal – 4:31.981 to 4:31.983. Thousandth-second timing was used again at the 1973 World Championships, but the controversy over the accuracy of such timing caused FINA to change their rules, so that in the future swimming times would only be measured to the hundredths of a second. Three days later Larsson won his second gold medal in the 200 IM, comfortably ahead of McKee with a world record time of 2:07.17. At the 1973 World Championships Larsson won gold in the 200 IM, his favorite event. Larsson retired from sports after the 1973 Worlds and, after graduating from the Swedish School of Sport and Health Sciences in 1975, worked until 1985 as a swimming coach and physical education teacher. From 1985-98 he operated a McDonald’s restaurant in Eskilstuna and from 1998-2002 worked as a consultant for McDonald’s. From 2000-2005 Larsson was a board member of the Swedish Swimming Federation.

After college Herland coached rowing, first at Ewauna Rowing Club in Klamath Falls, Oregon from 1975-78.

When glider pilots from Switzerland, Austria, Yugoslavia and Germany gathered on the 7 September 1935 on the Jungfraujoch for a competition, Schreiber left with his S 18, a Swiss construction of 14.5 meters span, from the small town of Thun “to a point near the Jungfraujoch drag”, set off, received several low updrafts and landed in Bellinzona after 90 km (straight line) and a 5½-hour flight, making him the first to cross the Alps with a glider. For this achievement he was awarded a gold medal from the IOC with the consent of the Fédération Aéronautique Internationale. Schreiber set several national records in continuous flight and in 1937 became the first Swiss champion in this discipline. He not only cared about sporting matters, but also technical ones like airplane towing options, construction of transport carts, as well as organizational issues. In Switzerland Schreiber made a career as a military pilot and instructor and authorized expert for airplane accidents. But he could not get used to a peaceful civilian life. In the 1960s he became a bush pilot and worked for relief organizations in the Himalayas, South Africa, Korea and Biafra (Nigeria). When he had to stop flying as a pilot he had been in the air for about 5,000 hours. In 1976 his family left him because they could not cope with his style of living any longer, so during his later life he continued to have temporary homes in the Alps and died on the Rigi Massif close to his birthplace.

His biggest assignment was the decoration of the Järntorget in Göteborg. He also designed jubilee medals for Pierre de Coubertin and the 1944 Olympic Games. His brother Nils Strindberg (1872-97) was a photographer and member of the failed 1897 North Pole gas balloon expedition with August Salomon Andrée (1854-97).

Strindberg produced a number of girl figures during his long productive period. In 1925 his bronze sculpture Crocus was erected, which represents a girl with a wilting crocus blossom in her hand. It is considered one of his masterpieces and can be found on the Stadshusterrassen in Stockholm. Additional copies of the 1 m tall figure are located in Göteborg, Karlshamn, and Borås.

Although other triumphs were ahead, it was perhaps this performance that first set Torvill and Dean apart from the rest of world’s ice dancers and raised them to a status of a sporting legend. Jayne Torvill, a clerk in a Nottingham insurance office, had won both a British junior and senior pairs’ championship with Michael Hutchison as her partner, but in 1975 she teamed up with Christopher Dean in ice dancing and together they developed the most memorable partnership in the history of the sport. They won their first British title in 1978 and although they finished no higher than 11th at that year’s World Championships in Canada, a fortuitous meeting in Ottawa with the inspirational teacher Betty Calloway was a vital factor in the successes that were to come. Torvill and Dean improved to eighth place in the 1979 World Championships, then finished fourth in 1980 and took fifth place at the Lake Placid Olympics. In 1981 they won both the European and World Championships and defended both titles in 1982. They were forced to withdraw from the 1983 European Championships because of injury but won the world title for the third successive year and went to the1984 Olympics in Sarajevo as clear favorites. With a brilliant interpretation of Ravel’s Bolero, they matched their performance at the 1983 World Championships by drawing “sixes” for artistic impression from all nine judges, and their total of twelve “sixes” for the entire competition broke all previous records. Four weeks later, in Ottawa, they won their fourth successive world title and with a total of thirteen “sixes” they bettered the record they had set at the Olympics. Torvill and Dean then turned professional but when the rules on professionals in the Olympics were relaxed, they returned to the Winter Olympics in 1994, winning a bronze medal.

Ludwig first studied law, then art in Dresden, Karlsruhe, and Paris, and belonged, like Max Liebermann, to the Group of XI, later the Berlin Secession. Artistically he could not be classified easily as he painted in different genres: symbolism, art nouveau, historicism, and new objectivity. After his studies, he lived in Berlin and intermediately in Roma. In 1903, von Hofmann became a professor at the Weimar School of Art, but in 1916 moved to the Academy of Fine Arts in Dresden, until 1931. Some of his works were considered “degenerate” by the Nazis, while others were acceptable to the Reich. The drawing Polospieler (Polo Player, lead pencil/charcoal) could clearly be identified based on the illustration in the German catalog. The pastel drawing Reiter am Meer (Rider by the Sea) was on loan from the National Museum in Berlin. It is probably Young Men with Horses at the Seashore from 1894 in the format 31,4 x 23,5 cm. A - less probable – alternative is Young boys with horses at the Watering Pace (black chalk, pastel, 22,9 x 30,5 cm), which is also in possession of the National Gallery. The Ruderer (Rowers, in the international catalog Two Rowers) were probably preliminary sketches for a later oil painting. Both sketches and paintings are in the Hamburger Kunsthalle. A possible work with the motif Badende am Ufer (Bathers on the Shore) could be Badende Knaben am Elbufer bei Hamburg (_Boys Bathing on the Banks of the Elbe near Hamburg), created around 1908 with black chalk. The 134 x 193 mm drawing was already shown in 1918 in a book published by Reichskunstwart Edwin Redslob (1884-1973) and was owned by him at a later date.",

He was a member of the 10 American Painters, who were major exponents of the Impressionist style, a style which originated in the early 19th century. Its main characteristics were open compositions, and the accurate depiction of light, despite rather thin, yet visible brush strokes. My Children in the Woods, one of his well-known paintings, was in the Boston Museum of Fine Arts and is now in a private collection.

In 1922 an accident while filming left him with a severe leg injury and, in the hopes of nursing it back to health and not forfeiting his fledgling career, he took up fencing. By 1928 he was the World Sabre Champion and had found a place on the United States Olympic fencing team, although he would not actually compete in the Games until the 1932 Summer Olympics, where he placed fourth in the team sabre event. Almost immediately after his injury, however, he had begun working as a fight coordinator on numerous Hollywood productions and, by 1935, he had given up amateur competition in favour of working on films and occasionally taking up uncredited roles as fencers in the productions. By the time of his last production, 1981’s Clash of the Titans, he had been associated with dozens of films. He ran a fencing studio in Hollywood from the 1930s and worked there full time into his 90s.

Seven years later he moved from Trieste to the Federal Centre of Pratoni del Vivaro near Roma under the guidance of the Italian general manager Lucio Manzin. In 1973 he won his first Italian title and defended it for the next two years. At his first Olympic appearance in Montréal in 1976, Roman was 9th in the individual Three-Day Event, but was the top competitor four years later at the Moskva Games by virtue of his win in the individual trial and his silver medal in the team event, alongside his brother Mauro (the 1976 Italian champion), Anna Casagrande and Marina Sciocchetti. The participation of these athletes at the 1980 Olympics was contentious and opposed by the Italian Federation, who were in favour of the boycott. The technical assistance (veterinary, stable head, farrier) was, however, ensured personally by the athletes. Roman’s endurance under a heavy rain was memorable. He repeatedly descended from the saddle, from one side of the horse to the other, without getting tired. After breaking with the leaders of the Federation for a long time, Roman returned to important competitions in 1987 and, five years later, attended his third Olympics in Barcelona in 1992.",Brother of Mauro Roman Father of Luca Roman Father of Pietro Roman

81375,Kira Ivanova,Female,10 January 1963,159.0,48, Soviet Union,URS,"Kira Ivanova is the only Soviet female singles skater to win an Olympic medal, but her life was turbulent both on and off the ice. At the beginning of her career, Ivanova was known as a good free skater with strong triple jumps and strong ballet training, but she later became known as the “queen of compulsory figures” who had become an inconsistent free skater. In her era, she was one of the very few female skaters to have completed a clean triple-triple jump combination, but her inconsistent performances at competitions never allowed her to win a major international tournament. Ivanova rose to prominence in 1979, when she won her first Soviet title. She also competed at the World and European Championships between 1979 and 1981 and at the 1980 Olympics, but not very successfully. In 1981 Ivanova won her second Soviet title, but after that she was banned from international competitions for nearly two years by Soviet skating officials because of her very heated relationship, both professional and romantic, with her coach Vladimir Kovalyov, inconsistent training, alcohol abuse and erratic public outbursts. She was also considered a high risk for defecting to the West. Despite that, she was still one of the best Soviet female singles skater and in 1984, when she was again allowed to compete internationally she was fourth at both the European and World Championships and won a bronze at the 1984 Olympics. In 1985, Ivanova won her only World Championship medal, a silver, and from 1985-88 she won four silvers in a row at the European Championships. She also competed at the 1988 Olympics, where she finished first in the compulsory figures, but skated poorly in both the short and long programs and finished seventh. Domestically, besides her titles in 1979 and 1981, Ivanova won her third Soviet title in 1988 and won three silvers in a row from 1985-87, behind Anna Kondrashova. After finishing her career in 1988, Ivanova suffered from alcoholism and although she underwent several attempts at rehab, there were no visible results. On 21 December 2001, Ivanova’s body was found by her neighbors in her Moscow apartment. The police investigation established that she had apparently died of stab wounds inflicted by a butcher’s knife three days earlier and it was speculated to be a random attack. Her assailant was never caught. The actress Keira Knightley is named in her honor albeit with an incorrect spelling.",Listed in Olympians Who Were Murdered (Found stabbed to death in her apartment.)

On arrival in Jennersdorf he joined a group of Hungarian miners who were recruited by Britain’s National Coal Board and he worked for a brief time in the Yorkshire coalfield. He was then offered a chance to study medicine at Oxford University and it was during his time there that he resumed his interest in shooting. After qualifying as a doctor he settled in Liverpool, joined the local Mossley Hill club and, when he gained British nationality, became a regular member of the national pistol shooting team. Although he won numerous national titles his only medal on the international stage came in 1974 when he won the bronze in the free pistol at the British Commonwealth Games in Christchurch. The 1976 Games at Montréal would be his only competitive appearance at Olympic level though he went to the 1988 Games as the medical officer to the British marksmen and fulfilled the same role at World and European Championships.

She would often watch the men practice. After leaving Windsor in 1905, Dyson went to live in Sanderstead in South London and formed their first fire brigade. He later moved to Bognor Regis.

International medals came his way in 1962 when he won a bronze medal in both the 4x110 and 4x220 yards relays at the British Empire and Commonwealth Games at Perth, Australia. That same year Martin-Dye also won a 4x100 metre freestyle relay silver medal at the European Championships in Leipzig. Having competed in his second Olympics at Tokyo in 1964, Martin-Dye rounded off his international career as captain of the England swimming team at the 1966 British Empire and Commonwealth Games at Kingston by adding another bronze medal to his collection, in the 4x110 yards free relay. On home soil, Martin-Dye, who had more than 40 international caps to his name, won six ASA freestyle titles from 110 yards to one mile. He won his first title (440 yards) in 1960 and the following year had the rare distinction of winning the 110, 220, and 440 yards titles at the same championships. In 1962 he enjoyed podium finishes in the same three distances but without a first place. Martin-Dye added two more titles in 1963 (440 yards and one mile). He also broke the British 220 yards free record three times between 1961-64, and also twice broke the 440 record, and in 1964 took it below 4:30 for the first time. Martin-Dye took up water polo with the Penguin Club and soon established himself as an England and Great Britain international. His finest moment came in 1965 when he scored five goals in the Penguins 6-5 win over Cheltenham at Walsall in the final to win the National Team Water Polo Championship. Martin-Dye later went on to coach both the Watford Swimming, and Water Polo Clubs. In 1968, he married fellow swimmer Delia Williams, a Watford member and Hertfordshire 100 yards freestyle champion 1961-66 At the time of the Roma Olympics, Martin-Dye was a wages clerk at Kensington Town Hall but later spent 28 years as a textile technologist for Marks & Spencer at their London head office. He later received an honorary degree from Nottingham University for his services to the textile industry. John’s son Graham was also a swimmer and international water polo player.","Listed in Olympians Who Set a European Record in Long Course Swimming (4×200 m freestyle relay – 29 August 1960 - 21 August 1962: 8:26.9 (29 August 1960; Roma, ITA)) Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the European Aquatics Championships (0–1–0 1962 Leipzig SWM silver: 4×100 m freestyle relay) Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the British Empire/Commonwealth Games (0–0–3 1962 Perth SWI bronze: 4×110 yards freestyle and 4×220 yards freestyle (competed for England); 1966 Kingston SWI bronze: 4×110 yards freestyle (competed for England))"

At the AAU Championships, Kraenzlein won the 120 yard hurdles in 1898-99, the 220 yard hurdles in 1897-99, and the long jump in 1899. He also won eight titles between 1898 and 1900 in the collegiate championships, then the IC4A, while representing Penn. He began his collegiate career at the University of Wisconsin, but transferred to Penn after the 1897 season. Kraenzlein’s pioneering technique of straight-leg hurdling brought him two world hurdle records in addition to his five world records in the long jump. The long jump records were all set in 1899, three in April at the Penn Relays, and two in May at the IC4A Championships. His great rival was the Syracuse athlete, Meyer Prinstein. At the 1900 Paris Olympics Prinstein led after the qualifying round, but refused to compete in the finals because they were held on Sunday. He lost when Kraenzlein jumped one centimetre farther in the final. Prinstein was so upset by Kraenzlein’s action that he supposedly assaulted him and punched him. Although a qualified dentist, Kraenzlein never practiced, preferring to become a track coach, notably of the German and Cuban national teams and at the University of Michigan, and after World War I, at his alma mater, Penn, where he served until his death from pleurisy.

Her father was the mayor of The Hague, but she became an orphan at age 16. De Beaufort married Herman Laman Trip in 1914 and together, they founded a sanatorium for children at German Oberstdorf in the Allgäu Alps called “Hohes Licht“. Beside her work for the sanatorium she began writing novels. After 1933 they saved several Jewish children, making their flights to Switzerland with the help of false passports, as the sanatorium had international status. After her return to the Netherlands during World War II she concentrated on her own creative work. Laman Trip published her own works and was awarded the Prize for Literature by the Ministry of Education, Arts and Sciences in 1954. In 1956 she sold “Hohes Licht”, having less time to deal with it because of her writing. She wrote biographies of Queen Juliana in 1959 and of Queen Wilhelmina in 1965. Even in her later years she was an administrator in several literary associations in the Netherlands. On her 80th birthday Laman Trip was awarded the Order of Orange-Nassau. Her success was based on her gift of storytelling and her meticulous writing style. The short story Makkerschap (Companionship) first appeared in 1929 in the literary journal “De Nieuwe Gids”. It tells the story a ski tour in the Gotthard area, where the group is caught by surprise by a snowstorm.",

80785,Fiona Campbell,Female,12 May 1929,,, Great Britain,GBR,"Had she not been an Olympic skier, Fiona Campbell could have well been an Olympic equestrian rider, for she was riding ponies from the minute she could walk. Her love of horses saw her become a Pony Club instructor, a keen hunter, and great follower of the Turf, but it was skiing that attracted her competitive nature. Born in Bermuda, where her father was stationed with the Army, Fiona and her family regularly went on winter skiing holidays, and after World War II, she developed a skill for competitive skiing. In 1950 she won the demanding 6.5 km downhill Cornergrat Ladies Derby at Zermatt, Switzerland. Her winning time was better than many of the competitors taking part in the men’s race. Had it not been for a heavy fall, Campbell may well have retained her title in 1951. The following year she was selected for the Olympics, and took part in the giant slalom and downhill. Campbell married an Irish-born doctor, Kenneth Gray, in 1953 and he practiced at Ampleforth in North Yorkshire. After his retirement in 1981 they moved to nearby East Harlsey where she built stables and realised her dream of breeding and racing horses. She took out a trainer’s licence and had several successes with a hunter chaser called New Formula, and after once seeing her daughter cross the line, albeit not as the winner, on the horse in the Foxhunter Chase at Aintree, she said “That was the most exhilarating thing I have done since the Olympics in 1952.”",

His critics, who maintained that only the ABA champions should be included in the team for Mexico, were silenced when Finnegan became the first Briton since Harry Mallin in 1924 to win the Olympic middleweight crown. In the semi-finals he survived two standing counts against the American, Al Jones, and was involved in another close decision in the final when the judges voted 3-2 in Finnegan’s favor at the end of his bout with the Russian, Aleksey Kiselyov. A bricklayer by trade, Finnegan was awarded the MBE after his victory in Mexico City and he soon turned professional, going on to win the British, Commonwealth and European light-heavyweight titles. In September 1972 he challenged for the world title at Wembley but lost to the defending champion, Bob Foster of America, in a 14th round KO. Before the year was out he had lost his European title and was soon deprived of his British and Commonwealth crowns by John Conteh. He regained the British title in 1975 but suffered a detached retina and was forced to retire soon afterwards. The name of Finnegan was not, however, completely lost to boxing fans as his younger brother, Kevin, won the European middleweight title in 1974 and again in 1980. Finnegan suffered ill health and financial problems in later life and died in 2009.",

Vartia became one of the most important personalities in Finnish gymnastics and was the leader of the Finnish men’s gymnastics team in London in 1908 and in Stockholm in 1912. In his books Vartia also laid down the principles of the gymnastics movement that he had developed. In addition, he was editor-in-chief of the Finnish Sports Magazine from 1908-13 and secretary of the newly founded Finnish Gymnastics and Sports Federation from 1907-10. Subsequently, he served on the Executive Committee and the Federation’s Board of Directors. Vartia joined the staff of the Jyväskylä Seminary in Central Finland as a lecturer in 1913, where he also played a significant role in the regional development of sports. However, he agitated against the participation of athletes who had fought on the side of the “Reds” in the Civil War. Back in Helsinki, he was an inspector of gymnastics and health care at the school board for 25 years. During this time, he was also the chairman of the State Sport and Gymnastics Committee, which was responsible for allocating state funds to the sports infrastructure. In the early 1930s, Vartia was elected chairman of the Finnish Skating Federation and a member of the board of the Finnish Olympic Committee. Together with Martti Jukola and Akseli Kaskela, he was editor-in-chief of the sports magazine Urheilija from 1928-34.

In Los Angeles he won medals in the triple jump (gold) and long jump (bronze), finishing fifth with the sprint relay. He was the first athlete to simultaneously hold the world records in the long and triple jump. His long jump record of 7.98 metres stood for almost 40 years as a national best. An accomplished sprinter, Nanbu won the 100 metres at the 1930 and 1933 Japanese Championships and in 1931 set a Japanese record with 10.6. In addition, he won two titles in the 4x100 m relay and six consecutively in the long jump, although never in the triple jump. At the Far Eastern Games Nanbu won one gold, two silver and three bronze medals from 1925-30. A native of Sapporo in Northern Japan and the son of a liquor store owner, Nanbu tried to strengthen his physical fitness and joined the track & field club. In junior high school, he already excelled in the sprints and long jump. His first major competition was the national trials for the 1924 Olympics. Although he beat Mikio Oda at the trials, he did not go to Paris. Nanbu practiced indoors during the winter, often running up and down the stairs in department stores. He then studied at the prestigious Waseda University and initially joined South Manchuria Railway after graduating. He soon moved to Senriyama near Osaka, where he worked for the sporting goods manufacturer Mizonu and trained at the nearby Kansai University, together with Oda. Two years after the Los Angeles Olympics, Nanbu injured his Achilles tendon and had to retire from active sports. He later became coach, sports official and sports editor for the newspaper Mainichi Shimbun, and also worked as a university professor at Hokkaido Women’s Junior College (later Hokusho University) and president of Tottori Women’s Junior College. In 1964 he was the manager of the Japanese Olympic team. In 1983 Nanbu was awarded the Olympic Order in Silver. He eventually died of pneumonia. His name is seen written in many sources as Nambu. The International Federation of Athletics Federations (IAAF) elected 12 athletes including Nanbu for the Heritage Plaque, established in 2018.

After an interruption of several years due to World War II, he completed his studies in 1949 with a diploma with distinction, and received the State Prize of the Academy of Fine Arts in the following year. For the next decades he worked as a freelance artist and had numerous exhibitions at home and abroad. Wanke was appointed professor in 1977 and was twice awarded the Austrian State Prize (1950, 1961), as well as the Austrian Cross of Honor for Science and Art. From 1968, he directed the symposia and musical summer courses in Neumarkt an der Raab. Wanke lived and worked in southern part of the Burgenland province since 1981. Its landscape, as well as that of the Bretagne, inspired him to numerous works. In 1993, his adopted home honored him with the Great Medal of Honor of the Province of Burgenland. Initially, Wanke devoted himself primarily to expressionist woodcuts. Because of a war injury he had to give up his plan to become a pianist. He transformed, however, the works of classical composers - from Beethoven to Schönberg - into pictures in numerous graphic cycles. Later, watercolors and finally oil paintings in strong colors were the focus of his artistic activities. Wanke’s works can be found today mainly in renowned museums and galleries in Austria, but also in various private collections. Wanke and Maximilian Melcher jointly submitted a gouache titled Departure to the Olympics. This particular work could not be identified, but at least Wanke had already created a woodcut with Olympic motifs in 1940. Later, the two worked together again. In 1955, for example, both created large mosaic pictures of children for apartment buildings on Wien’s Aichholzgasse.",

That does not, however, tell anything like the full story of Macgregor, who was a major influence on distance running in Scotland. He won three Scottish AAA marathon titles in 1973-74, and 1976, and also finished second six times between 1965-86. His 24 sub 2-20 marathons was a Scottish record, and one of them came when he was 43-years-of-age. Macgregor attended the Daniel Stewart’s school (now Stewart’s Melville College) in Edinburgh, which had an excellent reputation for producing fine rugby players. As he did not take to the sport, however, Macgregor concentrated on running instead. After Stewart’s, he went to St Andrews University from where he qualified as a French and German teacher. Also, during his time at university, he became an excellent cross-country runner and a good distance runner on the track, winning the Scottish AAAs 6 and 10 mile titles. He tried his first marathon in 1965 and finished in a promising 2-22:24. Two years later he finished third in the AAAs marathon at Nuneaton behind Jim Alder and fellow Scot Alastair Wood. Macgregor also finished third again at Manchester in 1972, this time behind West Germany’s Lutz Philipp and Ron Hill. At the 1972 Olympics, Macgregor finished seventh but was rightly proud of his achievement because he was just 1:26 seconds off a medal place. Macgregor won the world veteran 10,000 metres title in 1979, and added the marathon title the following year at Bellahouston, Glasgow. Macgregor ran for Edinburgh Southern Harriers and then Fife AC, for whom he became a coach later in his career. In 1980, when part of the David Puttnam film Chariots of Fire was being filmed on a St Andrews beach, Macgregor was requested by a journalist to assemble a team of runners who could be used as extras in the shoot. He duly obliged, but did not appear himself because he did not want to take a day off from his teaching job at the local Madras College. Following retirement from teaching in 1999, Macgregor took an active role in the St Andrews community and local politics. Personal Best: Mar – 2-14:16 (1974).",

Between 1992-2004 she won 10 Olympic medals as a freestyler (four silver and six bronze), although she never won a gold medal. Her medals, all for Germany, came in the 100 and 200 free, and relay events. Van Almsick was world champion in the 100 metres free in 1994, and in total won two gold, two silver and two bronze medals at the World Championships. However, her greatest successes came at the Europeans where, in both 1993 and 1995, she won six gold medals at each meet. Her golds in 1993 were in the sprint freestyle events (50, 100, 200) and the three relays, while in 1995 she increased her distance a bit, winning over 100, 200, and 400 freestyle, and again anchoring all three German relay teams to victory. In total, she won 18 gold medals and three silver medals at Europeans. Van Almsick’s beauty and swim prowess brought her great fame in Germany and enabled her to become quite wealthy via endorsements. In 1993, 1995, and 2002, Van Almsick was named Sportswoman of the Year in Germany, and from 1992-95 was German Swimmer of the Year. In 1993-94, and 2002, she was also elected European Female Swimmer of the Year, and in 1993 Female World Swimmer of the Year. Van Almsick received the German Media Prize Bambi in 1992 and 2002, and was elected European Sportswoman of the Year in 1993. In 1992 and 2005, she was awarded the Silver Bay Leaf, Germany’s highest sports award. After her retirement Van Almsick worked with German TV channels ARD and RTL covering major swimming and Formula One events. From 2008, she worked with the Deutsche Sporthilfe. Van Almsick also started her own foundation to help children learn to swim. During her sports career, Van Almsick occasionally posed as a swimming model. Her relationships with teammate Steffen Zesner, which led to a legal battle with the German yellow press, and handball player Stefan Kretzschmar were focused in Germany, as was the relationship with her later life partner, entrepreneur Jürgen B. Harder. Van Almsick raised two sons with Harder. In 2004 her autobiography “Aufgetaucht” (Coming Up) was published.

At age 15, Anna won a scholarship to the Royal Academy Schools in London from Harrow School of Art, and first exhibited at the Royal Academy at age 18. In 1920 and 1921 Anna won the Landseer Award.

Both sisters painted murals for the passenger liners Queen Mary and Queen Elizabeth, and both were official war artists during World War II. Anna is best known as a portrait painter, with her famous subjects including Prince Philip, Sir Alexander Fleming, and Lord Beaverbrook. Anna became a highly successful and talented portrait painter, with her subjects including members of the Royal Society. She also painted still lifes, mostly flowers. She was married to Captain Guy Heseltine and had a daughter. Their home was destroyed during a bombing raid in World War II, during which time she worked as an auxiliary nurse and was involved in medical illustration. The Ringside Sketches can still be identified by an 1948 art show sticker surviving on the verso. The three charcoal drawings have a maximum size of 56 x 39 cm.

Born in what is now Ukraine as Serhiy Eduardovych Bortkevych, he studied law and music in St. Petersburg from 1896, and music in Leipzig from 1900. Until the outbreak of World War I, he lived in Berlin, from where he undertook concert tours throughout Europe and temporarily taught at a conservatory. During this time, he also began his career as a composer. Bortkiewicz returned to Russia in 1914 and lived on his estate near Charkiv. After the October Revolution, he fled to Istanbul via Sebastopol in 1920 and went to Vienna in 1922, where he became a “Federal citizen” a few years later. From 1928 he lived in Berlin again, but returned to Vienna after Hitler came to power in 1933. There, he lived until his death and was buried in a grave of honor on the Central Cemetery. Bortkiewicz composed an opera, two symphonies, cello, violin and piano concertos, orchestral and chamber music and numerous piano pieces. He saw himself as a romantic in the footsteps of Chopin and Liszt and influenced by Russian composers rejecting modern atonal music. Bortkiewicz also translated the correspondence between Peter Tchaikovsky and his patron Nadeschda von Meck into German, which was published as a book in 1938. In 1948, Bortkiewiecz won the preliminary round in Austria for the Olympic art competitions with his composition “Olympic Scherzo” for orchestra.

He started boxing under the guidance of his father and coach Scipione. As an amateur he fought 112 matches from 1986 to 1992, with 108 victories and 4 losses. The highlight of his amateur career came in 1991 when he won a bronze medal at the European Championship. He was eliminated in his first contest at the same year’s World Championship and also at the 1989 European Championships. Piccirillo turned professional after the Barcelona Games. In his 11th pro contest in 1994 he won the Intercontinental Light-Welterweight title against the Mexican Manuel Hernández, then on 21 July 1995, he became Italian champion against Franco Palmiero. His first defeat came in April 1996, in Denmark, where he lost a bout for the European title against the Dane Soren Sondergaard. After a final defense of the Italian title, he moved up to welterweight. On 29 November 1997, he knocked out the Briton Geoff McCreesh, to win the European welterweight crown. Piccirillo immediately abandoned the title to challenge for the WBU world title, an organization with minimal recognition around the world. He won this title on 4 May 1998, at Catania in Sicily, against his fellow Italian Alessandro Duran. After 8 successful defences, he relinquished the title to fight for the more prestigious IBF title, which he then won in April 2002 by decision over the American Cory Spinks, the son of Leon Spinks which USA Today newspaper described as one of the most controversial decisions in modern boxing history. He lost the title the following year in a rematch. After this Piccirillo moved up in weight again, this time to light-middleweights. On 13 August 2005, in Chicago, he was defeated by Ricardo Mayorga (Nicaragua) in a match for the latter’s WBC world crown. He rebounded to win the vacant European light-middleweight title against Lukáš Konečný, then defended it twice against Luca Messi and Michael Jones. On 1 December 2007, at Foxwoods Casino in Mashantucket, Connecticut, he tried again to win the world title, but was knocked out in round 11 by the American Vernon Forrest.

Jackson went one better in 1925 and reached the final, but lost to the experienced Harry Mitchell, who won his fourth consecutive title. Jackson eventually won the light-heavyweight crown in 1927, when he beat the Glamorgan policeman Rhys Howells. The following year, Jackson would engage in some exciting contests with the London City policeman Joe Goyder, the man he beat in the 1927 ABA semis. Jackson beat Goyder to win the 1928 Police Championship (light-heavy) and, a month later, beat him in the ABA final. Goyder got his revenge in 1929, however, when he thwarted Jackson’s attempt to win a third successive ABA title, by beating him in the semi-final. Some sources say that Jackson was eliminated in the middleweight quarter-finals at the 1934 European Championships in Budapest, but that fighter was J. W. Jackson of the Printing and Allied Trades Boxing Club, and not policeman Alf Jackson.",

De Vincentiis’ rivalry with Silvano Simeon in the 1970s was memorable and reached its climax in Roma the evening of 27 May 1976 when the two athletes challenged each other with two Italian records, with De Vincentiis first with 64.48 and Simeon second with 65.10. Domestically, de Vicentiis won 5 Italian titles, in 1975-76, 1978, and 1980-81. He took part twice in the Olympic Games.

Together with his brothers, he cultivated a passion for horses since he was a child. Oppes had gone to boarding school in Sassari on Sardinia island and then enlisted in the Carabinieri, where he became a major marshal. A career non-commissioned officer, Oppes held the rank of Brigadier of the Royal Carabinieri when he was in East Africa and was one of the 58 survivors of the Battle of Culqualber. This battle was fought in Abyssinia (present-day Ethiopia) from 6 August to 21 November 1941 between the Italians and the British. It was a bloody battle in which the 1st Carabinieri Mobilized Group, under the command of the Carabinieri Major Alfredo Serranti, almost completely immolated itself. The valor and courage of the Carabinieri earned its few survivors tribute from their British opponents of the honor of arms. Upon returning to his homeland after various territorial services, Oppes was assigned to the 4th Carabinieri Regiment on horseback where, with the Colonel of the Carabinieri Raimondo D’Inzeo and along with his brother Salvatore Oppes, he too an officer of the Carabinieri, they wrote a large part of the history of modern military riding.",Brother of Salvatore Oppes

He attended his first of five Summer Olympics in 1952, where his best result was fourth in the 50 metre rifle, prone. In that event, he found himself in a three-way tie for the bronze medal with Art Jackson of the United States and Erich Spörer of Germany, each having scored 399 out of a total of 400 points. Boa and Jackson had more hits in the center ring than Spörer, which was the first tie breaker, but the judges determined that Jackson had been the more accurate shot and awarded him the bronze. Boa’s biggest success came in 1954, when he set a world record (598 out of 600) and won the 50+100 m rifle, prone event at the World Championships, Canada’s only medal at the tournament. Two years later he was back at the Olympics and again tied for bronze, now sharing that distinction with 1952 gold medalist Iosif Sîrbu of Romania, as well as Sándor Krebs of Hungary, Erling Kongshaug of Norway, and Otakar Hořínek of Czechoslovakia. This time, however, the judges decided in his favor and Boa stood on the podium with his countryman Gerry Ouellette, who had won the gold medal despite sharing a rifle with Boa. Boa attended three more editions of the Summer Olympics, in 1960, 1964, and 1972, but only came close to the podium in the 50 m rifle, prone event at the 1964 Games, where he was again fourth (although not by virtue of a tie-breaker). He also served as his nation’s flagbearer in the Opening Ceremony of those Olympics. He captured gold in the small bore rifle event at the 1966 British Empire and Commonwealth Games, but only managed sixth in the 50 m rifle, prone at the 1967 Pan American Games. Four years later, however, he participated in arguably his most successful major international tournament, the 1971 Pan American Games, where he took silver in the 50 m rifle, prone and bronze in the 50 m rifle prone team. He likely had many competitive years left in him after the Munich Olympics, but he died of a brain hemorrhage in September 1973, at the age of only 49. He has been inducted into the Canadian Olympic and Canada’s Sports Halls of Fame.","Son of James Boa Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the Summer Pan American Games (0–2–1 1967 Winnipeg SHO silver: small-bore rifle prone team; 1971 Cali SHO silver: small-bore rifle prone, bronze: small-bore rifle prone team) Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the British Empire/Commonwealth Games (1–0–0 1966 Kingston SHO gold: 50 m small-bore rifle prone) Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the World Shooting Championships (1–0–0 1954 Caracas gold: 50+100 m free rifle prone)"

She retired from running just two months prior to the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta. Inspired by watching the 1976 Olympic Games in Montréal on television, on September 11, 1976, Ruegger wrote on a piece of paper, “My Goal: To make it to the 1980 Olympic Games in Moscow, and win for Canada” hiding the note in the old wooden floorboards of the farmhouse she grew up in. A woman of unrelenting faith, Ruegger lived a life of inspiration specifically making an impact on children, inspiring millions of young runners, especially girls.

The son of William Holabird, John Augur Holabird (Born 4 May 1886 in Evanston, Illinois, died 1 May 1945 in Chicago, Illinois) studied architecture at the Ecole des Beaux Art in Paris between 1909-13, where he became friends with another American, John Root. Together they joined his father’s office. In the 1920s, John Augur Holabird and Root became increasingly in charge of the business. The firm of Holabird & Roche had been founded in 1880 as Holabird & Simonds. Roche joined them in 1881 and they became Holabird, Simonds & Roche until 1883, when Simonds left the firm. After the founders’ deaths, the firm became known as Holabird & Root. This is the name by which it is still known in Chicago, and it remains one of the better known architectural firms in the American midwest. In 1928, Holabird & Roche submitted a Plan of the Stadium of the University of Illinois. It was named Memorial Stadium to commemorate the university’s students who were killed in World War I represented by a colonnade of 183 limestone columns. The original plans also comprised a campanile, fountains, and ornate entrances to the stadium. The official opening took place in 1924. The stadium initially accommodated 55,000 spectators, but today, after numerous conversions, it holds about 60,000. Their second entry was the Stadium for the South Park Commissioner Chicago. The Municipal Grant Park Stadium with a capacity of 90,000 seats was inaugurated in 1924 on the 53rd anniversary of the Great Chicago Fire. In 1925 it was renamed Soldier Field. In this stadium, games of the World Cups in 1994 (men) and 1999 (women) took place. After a complete renovation in 2003, only the Doric façade has been preserved.",

The three siblings were all selected for the 1948 Olympics, but Mick could not compete in the water polo competition because he could not get time away from work with the Royal Navy Air Arm. Following on from his Boy Scouts success in 1937, John also won the 100 yards freestyle at the Western Boys’ Championship, and was third in the senior 220 yards that same year. In 1938, he won his first Somerset title and the first of many Western Counties titles, the 220 yards. Holt made his international début against Germany just before the outbreak of World War II.

921118,Jan Sluijters,Male,17 December 1881,,, Netherlands,NED,"Dutch painter and draughtsman Jan Sluijters started artistic training in ’s Hertogenbosch (1893–94), where his father was a wood-engraver. In 1894 his family moved to Amsterdam, where Jan Sluijters spent the rest of his life. After taking his art teacher’s certificate he moved to the Rijksakademie. In 1904 he won the Prix de Rome. Visiting Paris in 1906, Sluijters became fascinated by modern art. Sluijters’ style evolved from Symbolism to Art Nouveau before he was influenced by the work of Neo-Impressionists, Fauvists and such painters as Toulouse-Lautrec and Kees van Dongen, which resulted in sensational and dynamically modern work and made him a pioneer of modernism in the Netherlands. Sluijter assimilated influences including Cubism and Futurism into a divisionist style, characterized by an expressive use of bright dots, lines and blocks of color. He then returned to more realistic depictions. Jan Sluijters painted landscapes, but mainly women’s portraits – often as nudes – which were not uncontroversial at the time, especially since his models included women of color. He also, however, created portraits of children and, for economic reasons, designed advertising posters. In 1929 he was a member of the jury for the first “Miss Holland” beauty competition. His daughter Lies (1924–2010) was one of the best Dutch sprinters during World War II. Together with Fanny Blankers-Koen, she was a member of the relay team that set a 4x200 m world record in 1944. Jan Sluijters’ painting Negerbokser can be found in the catalog of the Amsterdam art competitions and can thus clearly be identified, although he painted a whole series with similar motifs in a short period. The oil painting on canvas was created as early as 1914 (127 x 95 cm). The title was later changed to Zwarte man met gele lendedoek (Black man with yellow loincloth). A more recent reproduction shows in detail differences from the version in the catalog.",

He is also considered one of the best photographers of the 20th century. Sheeler studied in Philadelphia and Paris. His education included instruction in industrial drawing and the applied arts at the School of Industrial Art in Philadelphia (1900-03), followed by traditional training in drawing and painting at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts (1903-06). One of Sheeler’s first major assignments as a photographer was ordered by the Ford automobile company. He was criticized for copying his own photographs in his paintings but countered the criticism by making changes in the details, some of which were difficult to recognize. Sheeler mainly painted industrial motifs and landscapes. Triggered by his time in Paris, his style developed into a realistic cubism. Starting in 1940, Sheeler’s paintings became predominantly abstract. Yachts, originally entitled Pertaining to Yachts and Yachting, was a painting in oil on canvas from 1922 (size 50.8 x 61 cm). It is in possession of the Philadelphia Museum of Art. Although he was never a sportsman, Sheeler planned to make a film about the New York Yacht Club, which was never realized, however. In advance, he probably studied the club’s sailboats. In 1924, he also converted the motif into a lithograph.",

When his father died, he continued to run the family’s shipping business. Early in 1936, Zhou Yuyu was Charlie Chaplin’s escort and interpreter during his visit to Shanghai.

Mogren had his breakthrough at the age of 20, when he finished in 10th place at a World Cup race in Reit im Winkl, Germany. He competed in five Olympics from 1984 to 1998 in 13 events. Individually, his best Olympics were in 1992 with his best finish being fifth in the pursuit. But his best Olympic performance was the gold medal in the relay at the 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary. At his last Olympics in 1998 he was the flag bearer for Sweden at the Opening Ceremony. His biggest successes occurred at the Nordic World Ski Championships where he earned nine medals. This included four golds (relay in 1987 and 1989 and individually the 50 km in 1991 and 1993), three silvers (15 km and 30 km in 1989 and relay in 1991), and two bronzes (50 km in 1987 and 10 km in 1991). He won the overall World Cup in 1986/87, and five times placed in the top three overall. Including his victories at World Championships he won a total of 15 World Cup races. Nationally, he won nine individual championships including the triple in 1986 and another nine in the relay. In 1990 he had acquired bronchial problems like others in the family. His asthma forced him to quit competitions when it was colder than minus 10°. Mogren competed for Åsarna IK, but later lived in Mora, where he served on the board of Mora IK. He also works as an expert commentator on the radio in skiing competitions. In 1993, he was awarded the gold medal of the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet and the Radiosportens Jerringpris for his 50 km World Championship gold medal in Falun. In 2000, he quit skiing at an international level and later worked in marketing and customer contacts in the heating and air conditioning industry. In 2008, Mogren participated together with partner Lotta Falkenbäck, one of Sweden’s best figure skaters, in the TV show contest Stars on Ice, but unfortunately he was involved in an accident and had to leave the competition.","Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the World Nordic Ski Championships (4–3–2 1987 Oberstdorf CCS gold: 4×10 km relay, bronze: 50 km; 1989 Lahti CCS gold: 4×10 km relay, silver: 15 km freestyle and 50 km; 1991 Val di Fiemme CCS gold: 50 km, silver: 4×10 km relay, bronze: 10 km; 1993 Falun CCS gold: 50 km)"

He then entered the University of Toronto and joined their hockey team, the Varsity Blues, for the 1954-1955 season and once again proved his ability to score points by ending year as second in league scoring. Perhaps more notably, however, he caused a stir during this time by suiting up for the Toronto Maple Leafs of the National Hockey League for one game, although he did not score any goals. The following season he joined the Kitchener-Waterloo Dutchmen of the Ontario Hockey Association’s senior league who, by virtue of having won the previous year’s Allan Cup, were selected to represent Canada at the 1956 Winter Olympics. At the tournament he played in eight games, scored seven goals, and took home a bronze medal.

920517,Cuthbert Orde,Male,18 December 1888,,, Great Britain,GBR,"Cuthbert Orde was an illustrator, mostly known for his drawings of Allied Battle of Britain pilots. He himself was also a pilot in World War I. He was officially commissioned by the Air Ministry to portray members of RAF Fighter Command during the Battle of Britain – in all 150 portraits were completed. These pilots were in the early part of their service at the time and many went on to become legendary names but all were members of Churchill’s “few” who showed great bravery under enormous pressure and seemingly insurmountable odds. He was the author of Pilots of Fighter Command: Sixty Four Portraits. He also painted landscapes and still lifes. In the early 1920s Orde had set up a painting studio in Paris, and influenced by the earlier Fauves movement, also experimented with a restricted palette. During World War I he was a member of the Royal Flying Corps and was eventually promoted Flight Commander to the rank of temporary Major in 1918. Forty of his friends spent an hour with him on his 80th birthday and after they left he told his wife “That is the best birthday party I have ever had” – he died a few hours later. His brother Herbert Walter Julian was killed in action during the war and his other brother Michael Amyas Julian was held as a POW from 1916-18 and died in a flying accident in 1920. His father Sir Julian Walter Orde (1861-1929) was the founder and a long-term Secretary of the Automobile Car Club of Britain and Ireland. The family had a strong military tradition going back several centuries. The portrait of Wing-Commander Orlebar A.F.C ., holder of world’s speed record was painted in 1931 (oil on canvas, 41.9 x 35.6 cm) and is in the Royal Air Force Museum. Augustus Henry Orlebar (1897-1943) was an Army and – after being wounded in World War I – Royal Air Force officer who served in both world wars. His last rank was deputy air marshal. Between the wars he was a test pilot and set an air speed record of 576 km/hr in 1929.",

Reggie Miller played in college at UCLA, graduating in 1987. He was drafted in the first round of the NBA Draft by the Indiana Pacers with the 11th overall pick. Miller would go on to become the Pacers shooting guard for almost two decades, retiring in 2005. A tremendous outside shooter, Miller scored over 25,000 NBA points, averaging over 18 ppg for his career, and finishing as the NBA all-time leader in 3-point field goals, a mark later surpassed by Ray Allen. Miller played in the NBA All-Star Game five times, in 1990, 1995-96, 1998, and 2000.

A former British number one, Gomer never won a national title but was runner-up three years in succession 1990-92. Gomer’s best Grand Slam results were in reaching the third round of both the Australian and US Opens. She lost to fellow Briton Jo Durie at Melbourne in 1985, and to Monica Seles at New York in 1991. Gomer’s finest moment came at Aptos, California, in 1988 when she won her only WTA final, beating fourth seed Robin White of the USA to win the Northern California Open. Gomer, who was coached by Chris Bradnam at the time, became the first Briton to win on the Tour for three years and the last singles winner until Heather Watson won the Japan Women’s Open 24 years later. Gomer’s win in Aptos propelled her to a career high 46 on the WTA singles rankings. In addition to her one WTA title, Gomer won twice on the ITF Circuit. She also appeared in the Wightman Cup four times between 1986-89 and lost all five singles and four doubles she played, including defeat three years in succession by Loris McNeil in the singles. The 1989 edition was the 61st and last Wightman Cup. Gomer appeared in the Federation Cup (now the Billie Jean Cup) in 1987-88 and 1992 and won all five doubles she played and had a 6/4 record in the singles. Gomer competed in the 1988 Seoul and 1992 Barcelona Olympics, and after a ten-year career on the WTA Tour, retired from competitive tennis after the Barcelona Games. She turned to coaching Clearview Ladies of Brentwood in the National Indoor League, and also occasionally played for them.",

In 1948 he was selected to represent Spain at that year’s Olympic boxing tournament, where he defeated Robert Cranston of India and Max Shacklady of Great Britain before being disqualified in the second round against upcoming gold medalist Július Torma of Czechoslovakia. Díaz turned professional following the Games and won seven of his first eight bouts to earn himself a chance at the Spanish welterweight title. He was bested by Antonio Monzon, however, and never again fought for a major title, retiring in 1953 with a record of 9-4-2.

He ended 1960 ranked first in the world, also winning German titles that year in the 100 and 200. But after the Rome Olympics, Hary was suspended by the Deutsche Leichtathletik-Verband (DLV) for padding expense reports, and was suspended to the end of 1961, after which he retired, also due to the effects of a knee injury from a car accident (for which he received 200,000 DM from his insurance company). The background behind his suspension was that he dealt with adidas and Puma simultaneously, changing his shoes between his gold-medal run and the medal ceremony, which was forbidden at that time. In 1980 Hary was sentenced to 18 months in prison for financial fraud, when, as a real estate trader, he was found to have de-frauded the Catholic Church of around 3.2 million DM, although parts of the decision were later reversed by the highest German Court, the Bundesgerichtshof.

105023,Lee McConnell,Female,9 October 1978,178.0,63, Great Britain,GBR,"Although she had dabbled in sprinting, Lee McConnell was a high jump specialist with a very respectable personal best of 1.88 m until 2001 when she was persuaded to move to 400 metre running. In her first season concentrating on the one-lap race she made the British team for the 2001 World Championship and was a finalist as part of the 4 x 400 relay team. She continued her rise in 2002 by becoming AAA Champion and winning medals at both the European Championships (bronze) and Commonwealth Games (silver), in what was for her a breakthrough season. McConnell’s career plateaued from then on and, although she was part of a bronze medal winning relay team at the 2005 World Championships, she decided to switch to the 400 intermediate hurdles. The three seasons she spent as a hurdler could be described as erratic and, whilst she did win a medal at the 2006 Commonwealth Games, she abandoned the event to return to the flat 400 permanently in 2008. Since then her best performances have been to reach the semi-finals of the 2008 Olympics and 2011 World Championships. In relay racing she won a bronze at the 2010 European Championships and a silver at the 2011 European Indoor Championships. In February 2010 the IAAF announced that American Crystal Cox had her results annulled, due to an admission of doping, for the period including the 2004 Olympics. Cox ran in the heats of the 4 x 400 m relay in Athens and IAAF rules state that in these circumstances Cox’s team has to be disqualified. The second anniversary of this announcement passed in early 2012 with no decision having been made as to the reallocation of medals. If the USA lose their gold medals McConnell is in line to inherit an Olympic bronze medal. But in 2013, both the IAAF and the IOC announced that the result would stand and the American squad (except Cox) would be allowed to retain their gold medals and that they now considered the case closed. Having finished fifth with the British 4 x 400 relay team at the London 2012 Olympics, McConnell was hoping to compete in the 2014 Commonwealth Games in her home city, Glasgow. However, she took time out in 2013 to have her first baby and, although she did briefly return to the track, she abandoned those plans and announced her retirement early in 2014. She still went to the Commonwealth Games, but as a commentator for the BBC.","Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the Summer Universiade (0–1–1 1999 Palma de Mallorca ATH bronze: 4×400 m relay; 2001 Beijing ATH silver: 4×400 m relay) Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the European Athletics Championships (0–1–1 2002 München bronze: 400 m; 2010 Barcelona silver: 4×400 m relay) Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the European Athletics Indoor Championships (0–1–2 2005 Madrid bronze: 4×400 m relay; 2007 Birmingham bronze: 4×400 m relay; 2011 Paris silver: 4×400 m relay) Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the World Athletics Championships (0–0–4 2005 Helsinki bronze: 4×400 m relay; 2007 Osaka bronze: 4×400 m relay; 2009 Berlin bronze: 4×400 m relay, 2011 Daegu bronze: 4×400 m relay) Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the British Empire/Commonwealth Games (0–1–1 2002 Manchester ATH silver: 400 m (competed for Scotland); 2006 Melbourne ATH bronze: 400 m hurdles (competed for Scotland))"

Nevertheless, Pertti Karppinen is one of the best ever Olympic rowers, equalling the mark of Vyacheslav Ivanov (URS) when he won the single sculls at three consecutive Olympics – 1976, 1980, and 1984. Pertti was introduced to rowing by his older brother Erkka. His younger brother Reima also became a rower, and the two even rowed to a silver medal at the 1981 World Championships in the double sculls. Although a finalist at the 1974 and 1975 World Championships, Karppinen’s 1976 title was considered an upset. He beat reiging World Champion Peter-Michael Kolbe, who had lead the entire race, with a formidable sprint to win the first Finnish rowing medal ever. The Karppinen-Kolbe rivalry would be the greatest one in the sport of rowing. Kolbe won 5 world titles, but never an Olympic gold medal, while Karppinen took two World Championships (1979 and 1985) and three Olympic titles. The West German boycott meant Kolbe was absent in Moscow, leaving an easy victory for the Finn. The 1984 skiff final was basically a copy of the 1976 race, Kolbe leading most of the time with Karppinen taking over on the home stretch. The former fireman, who was exceptionally tall for a rower at 2.01 m, tried for a record fourth title in Seoul but hugely disappointed by not making the final. Kolbe couldn’t benefit from his rival’s failure, winning a third silver medal to Thomas Lange (GDR).

Talented as a youngster, his determination to reach the top was further strengthened after his father, who had been his coach and primary source of encouragement, died in a riding accident in 1971. He made his international debut with the Canadian national team in 1975, winning a bronze medal in the team event at that year’s Pan American Games. His next stop was the 1976 Summer Olympics where, after Alwin Schockemöhle had achieved a flawless victory, Vaillancourt found himself tied for second with Debbie Johnsey of Great Britain and François Mathy of Belgium, necessitating a jump-off. Vaillancourt set the bar high with a show that only resulted in four fault points, and neither of the other riders were able to match it. Johnsey abandoned the round after nearly crashing her horse, while Mathy suffered eights fault points to claim bronze. Having earned silver, he finished fifth in the team event alongside Jim Day, Jim Elder, and Ian Millar. Vaillancourt continued riding for several years and won team silver at the 1979 Pan American Games. He was selected to participate at the 1980 Summer Olympics, but attended the Alternate Olympics instead after his country joined the boycott of the regular Games. There he attained a gold medal in the team event despite having to use his alternate horse. After retiring from active competition he became involved in coaching and course design and served as the team leader for the Canadian equestrian delegations to the 1994 and 1998 Summer Olympics. He was inducted into the Jump Canada Hall of Fame in 2009 and, as of 2012, remains only one of two Canadians to medal in an individual jumping event at the Olympics (the other being Eric Lamaze).",Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the Summer Pan American Games (0–1–1 1975 Ciudad de México EQU bronze: jumping team; 1979 San Juan EQU silver: jumping team)

After graduating from Stanford in 1919, he won his first major race when he captured the San Diego Thomas Lipton trophy with his 53-foot sloop, Galliano. From then on his successes were legion, but Churchill had to wait until 1928 for the United States to send yachtsmen to the Olympics. He competed in 1928, 1932, and 1936 to become the first American to compete in three Olympic regattas. In 1932, Churchill’s boat, the Angelita, won the gold easily by sweeping the Canadian entry in four straight races. Churchill was the captain of the U.S. yachting team in all three of his Olympic appearances and he would later serve on the international jury at the 1952 Games. After a disappointing performance at the 1936 Olympics, Owen Churchill leased a Tahitian island for two years and, while there, he was intrigued by the crudely fashioned fins which the natives used for diving. Churchill spotted the commercial possibilities of the swim fin and imported the idea to the states, where his “invention” was a huge commercial success.

Thus, Taffy Abel won a silver medal in his only Olympic appearance. He also scored 15 goals in Chamonix, catching the attention of NHL general managers. After the Olympics, Abel played one more year of amateur hockey with the St. Paul team, and then joined the Minneapolis Millers in 1925. In 1926, Taffy Abel signed with the New York Rangers as a free agent. He played for eight years in the NHL. He was the first American to play in the NHL, and during most of his career, was the only American in the league, and was also the first Native American in the NHL. With the Rangers in 1927-28, Abel became the first American Olympian to play on a Stanley Cup champion. A 6-1, 225 lb. defenseman, Abel was paired on defense with Ivan “Ching” Johnson on the Rangers. They were one of the toughest defenses in the league. In the Stanley Cup finals, the Rangers goalie, Lorne Chabot was injured, and the Abel-Johnson defense supported backup goalie (and general manager) Lester Patrick and enabled the Rangers to win the Cup. Taffy Abel was traded to the Chicago Black Hawks after the 1928-29 season. He played for five years in Chicago, retiring after the 1933-34 season, but played on a second Stanley Cup champion in 1934 with the Black Hawks. He retired at that point after the Black Hawks owner refused to give him a raise he had requested. During his NHL career, Abel played 333 games and, in an era when defenseman rarely scored, and no forward passing was allowed in the offensive zone, he totaled 18 goals and 18 assists. Huge for his era with a quick-temper, he was a ferocious body checker, and struck fear into most of his opponents. Taffy Abel was inducted as a charter member of the United States Hockey Hall of Fame in 1973. After his retirement from hockey, he operated Taffy’s Lodge, a tourist resort in his hometown of Sault Ste. Marie.",Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the World Ice Hockey Championships (0–1–0 1924 Chamonix (Olympics) silver)

He designed many changes in his sleds, testing them in wind tunnels, and putting his physics background to use to arrive at the best combinations of aerodynamic factors. Tyler eventually left Eastman Kodak and founded several electronic firms of his own.

From time to time, however, he returned to South Africa for several years and also spent his last years there. He was fortunate to be a man of means and had a considerable private income, which allowed him to concentrate on his art, which enabled him to maintain the highest of artistic standards without pandering to popular demand. Therefore, his output was comparatively small and he was a slow and considered worker with most of his work executed in marble or bronze. He is known for the bust of South African Boer War general Koos de la Rey, which was placed at his gravesite. The bronze statuette Boxer, one of Eloff’s best known works, is 105 cm high. It was first exhibited at the Salon d’Automne in Paris in 1912. The artist later donated the figure to the library of the University of Pretoria.

Initially, he had graduated as a musician from the Conservatory of Milano, and subsequently in law from the University of Pavia. He started his concert career by composing two classical romances. At the outbreak of World War I, Roghi attended the Military Academy of Modena. He served as an officer and was heavily wounded in the Battle of Bainsizza in Slovenia. After the war, he found that he could not continue his career as a concert pianist. Therefore, he practiced law but soon started writing articles about art and literature. In 1922, he published his first articles about sporting events, and in the same year became a full-time sports journalist. He signed with an anagram of his surname: Ghiro. Roghi was a brilliant writer on all aspects of sport, but especially Olympics, the FIFA World Cup, horse racing and cycling. In 1936, he joined the Italian troops invading Ethiopia. He was also founder and president of the Sports Journalists Group Milanese Unione Sportiva and the Italian Press, and was a vice-president of the International Sports Press. The title of his 1932 entry is unknown.

It would not be his last. At 14, he was the Canadian junior men’s champion and, later in 1955, he received the Lake Placid Sportsmanship Award at a tournament in New York. For the next three years he was runner-up in the Canadian senior championships to Charles Snelling, and also placed 4th in the North American Championships and 7th in the World Championships in 1957, and 4th in the latter in 1958. In 1959 he was finally named the Canadian and North American men’s champion in singles for a run that would last through 1962 and 1961 respectively. He also took the runner-up position at the World Championships. Thus, by the time that he attended the Winter Olympics in 1960, he was at his peak and he proved it by taking home the bronze medal in the singles event and the runner-up spot at the World Championships the next month. It was 1962, however, that solidified his name in figure skating history when he performed the first triple lutz jump ever seen in international competition (a feat that would not be repeated by a male for another 12 years) and was declared world champion. He had been in 2nd place, behind Karol Divín of Czechoslovakia, after the compulsories, and therefore knew that he would have to execute a performance worthy of a 5.9 or a perfect 6 from nearly every judge. To the music of Carmen, he opened his routine with the triple lutz to astonishment and thunderous applause from the audience, then continued flawlessly throughout his five minute performance. He received seven perfect scores from the judges during his winning routine, as well as a standing ovation from the audience, a record that still stands. His lowest score was 5.8, and he only received two of them. After the competition, the British Broadcasting Corporation named him their International Athlete of the Year. Nationally he was rewarded for his efforts with the Lou Marsh Trophy, given annually to Canada’s top athlete, as well as an induction into the Canada Sports Hall of Fame. He then turned professional and skated with the Ice Follies from 1962 through 1968. By 1965 Jackson was a well-known figure in the national and international sporting world, and was the subject of a documentary from the National Film Board of Canada entitled “King of Blades” (a biography of the same name was published in 1977). The following year he and his brother worked with Bauer to develop a line of figure skates that were marketed through Don Jackson Figure Skating Products. He was inducted into the World Figure Skating Hall of Fame in 1977 and the Ontario Sport Legends Hall of Fame in 2002, and was made a member of the Order of Canada in 1997.

Rogge was an accomplished sailor, competing in three Olympic Games (1968, 1972, 1976), making him the second IOC President (after Avery Brundage) to have competed in the Olympics. Rogge’s best Olympic finish was 14th in the Finn Monotype Class in 1972 at Munich. He also competed on one World Championship team in sailing and was a 16-time Belgian champion in the sport. In addition, he competed internationally for Belgium in rugby football, at which he was selected 10 times for the national team. Rogge’s career prior to ascending to the Presidency was as an orthopaedic surgeon in Belgium. He was formerly Chairman of the International Sailing Federation (ISAF) Medical Commission, and served as the Chief of the Orthopaedic Surgery Department at Ghent Hospital. As a surgeon, he specialized in sports medicine, particularly injuries to the knee and shoulder. Rogge was married to the former Anne Bovijn, and they had two children. As a sports administrator Rogge became head of the Comité Olympique et Interfédéral Belge in 1989 and in 1990 he became President of the European Olympic Committees (EOC). He was elected a member of the IOC in 1991 and was appointed to the Executive Board in 1998. He quickly established himself as one of the strongest candidates to succeed Juan Antonio Samaranch, and on 16 July 2001, at the 110th IOC Session in Moscow, he defeated Dick Pound (CAN), Kim Un-Yong (KOR), Pál Schmitt (HUN), and Anita DeFrantz (USA) to become the 8th IOC President. Rogge immediately took to institute cost-cutting reforms to the IOC. He also started the Olympic Games Study Commission to look at the overall costs of staging the Olympic Games, with an eye to prevent cost and size escalation. Under Rogge’s watch, the IOC expanded support for the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), which has been led by IOC Member Dick Pound, and enlarged and supported the fight against drugs in sport. Rogge’s primary legacy may become the Youth Olympic Games, a sort of Olympics for junior athletes that others proposed but which Rogge supported. He announced plans for the Youth Olympic Games at the IOC Session in Guatemala in July 2007. The first Youth Olympics were held in 2010 in Singapore, with the first Youth Olympic Winter Games conducted in 2012 in Innsbruck, Austria. In July 2002, Rogge was appointed a Count by the HM Albert II, King of Belgium. Already a Chevalier, he then possessed several titles, and while he was President, could have been known as Jacques, Count Chevalier Doctor President Rogge. However, he often showed a more common touch. At the 2002 Olympic Winter Games, NBC anchor Bob Costas interviewed him, and noting his various titles, asked how he would like to be addressed, to which Rogge responded, “Call me Jack.” After two terms as IOC President, Rogge stepped down in 2013 to be succeeded by German Thomas Bach.

In a second issue in 1923, he added a “confession” that he experienced a sense of pressure by this early glory. His literary writings and journalistic article now became limited to a sports theme. His manuscript History of the Modern Olympic Games from 1938 was the first on this subject in Italian. From 1933-39 Nicolai was chairman of the Press Office of the Italian NOC, later the Office of Propaganda and Press. He suggested to Mussolini – without success - to honor all Italian gold medal winners with a bronze statue. He was also a zealous advocate for the 1960 Games in Rome. His literary works including Sport and diporto (1928) and Ispirazione ed Arti plastche (1947) later fell into oblivion.",

69034,Launceston Elliot,Male,9 June 1874,188.0,102, Great Britain,GBR,"Britain’s first Olympic champion, Launceston Elliott was born in India to Charles Elliot and his third wife Ann, but he was named for the Tasmanian city in which he was conceived. He spent part of his early childhood in Australia and it was only when his father, a kinsman of the Earls of Minto gave up his post as a magistrate in India in 1887 and returned to farm in Essex that young Launceston saw England for the first time. He soon showed a keen interest in weightlifting and in 1891 at the age of 16, at which time he was already a pupil of the great Eugen Sandow, he entered for the first British weightlifting championship and made a creditable showing in a contest won by Lawrence Levy. In 1894 he won the British title and in 1896 he went to Athens for the first modern Olympic Games. Elliot was often described as one of the most handsome men of his generation and he certainly appealed to the Greeks. The 1906 Official Report noted: “this young man attracted universal admiration by his uncommon beauty. He was of impressive stature, tall, well-proportioned, his hair and complexion of surprising fairness”. Clearly the Englishman created something of a stir in Athens and one paper carried the report that “his handsome figure procured for him an offer of marriage from a highly-placed lady admirer”. Elliot was evidently not distracted by the publicity – he won the one-handed lift and his second place in the two-handed rested on a disputed decision. He raised the same weight as the winner, Viggo Jensen of Denmark, but as Elliot moved one of his feet during the lift, the Dane was awarded first prize on the basis of having a “superior style”. In Athens, Elliot also ran in the 100 metres, took part in the rope-climbing event and was fourth in the Greco-Roman heavyweight wrestling. In 1899 he literally went from strength to strength and set four new British records at the amateur championships. Around 1905, he turned professional and put on a Music Hall act with a partner named Montague Spencer. The two strongmen performed amid scenery representing the Roman arena and, bedecked in the garb of gladiators, they engaged in a mock contest during which they used the cestus, trident, net and other weapons of the arena. At the end of the show, Elliot gave exhibitions of strength, the favorite of which was to support across his shoulders a long metal pole from which, at each end, was suspended a bicycle and rider. With this load Elliot would start revolving, slowly at first, but finally at such a speed that the “riders” would be swung into a horizontal position. Despite being offered the hand of a “highly-placed lady” in Athens, Elliot married Emelia Holder, the daughter of a Kentish vicar, in 1897. In 1923, they settled in Australia, the scene of Launceston’s early childhood, and he became an honored member of a group of old-time athletes. In 1930, he failed to recover from an operation for cancer of the spine and is buried in the Fawker Cemetary in Melbourne. Personal Bests: 100 – unknown; DT – 31.00e (1900).",

921620,Will Simmons,Male,4 June 1884,,, United States,USA,"William Simmons was an American etcher, painter, and sculptor of wild life. He was best known for his etchings of animals, and his work is represented in the Library of Congress and the Corcoran Gallery of Art at the Smithsonian Institution. His father was Edward Emerson Simmons (1852-1931), one of the famous group called 10 American Painters. William Simmons was also related to essayist and poet Ralph Waldo Emerson. Simmons was born in an artists’ colony at the Costa Blanca in Spain, when his parents were traveling in Europe. The birth certificate lists him as Guglielmo Francisco Bernardino Esperanza Simmons y Schellenberger, which was anglicized to William Francis Bernard Simmons. However, he signed all his works as Will Simmons. Simmons spent the early years of his life in Spain and France and then in England, before he returned to a place called Old Manse in Concord, Massachusetts, previously the home of both Emerson and Nathaniel Hawthorne, which is now designated as a National Historic Landmark. Following early tutelage by his father, Simmons returned to Paris to study at the Académie Julian, where he developed an interest in animals. He spent most of his later life in Massachusetts as a member of several professional societies. According to the signature, Simmons’ only oil painting known as Leaping Trout was only created in 1944 and therefore probably does not correlate to the one submitted in Berlin in 1936.

He grew up as an orphan and studied at the School of Applied Arts in Breslau (now Wrocław) from 1911-14, then in Berlin. Because of a disability, he was invalided out as unfit before World War I. Karsch worked in a factory for two years and destroyed most of his previous work in 1924. After that, he found his own style mainly as a sculptor, and went to Rome with a scholarship. He won the bronze medal with his drawing Stabwechsel (Baton exchange) at the 1932 Los Angeles Olympics in the category of Paintings, Graphic Works. After 1937 several of his works were removed from museums and galleries and his financial situation became precarious. It was not until 1942 that Karsch received a lucrative commission from the city of Gdynia (in German Gdingen/Gotenhafen). One year later his Berlin studio was completely destroyed by a bomb attack. After the Russian Army occupied his residence Groß Gandern in February 1945, destroying his works, he and his wife, Liesbeth, committed joint suicide to avoid deportation.","Listed in Olympians Who Committed Suicide (After the Russian Army occupied his residence Groß Gandern in February 1945, destroying his works, he and his wife, Liesbeth, committed joint suicide to avoid deportation.)

Chetin was first noticed by the Soviet sports officials in 1963 when he finished fourth in the flyweight division at the Soviet championships. In 1964 Chetin won his first medal, a bronze in flyweight at the Soviet championships, and then, after moving up a class, became the top Soviet bantamweight. He was Soviet bantamweight champion in 1968-69, 1971-72 and 1976, while taking silver at the Soviet championships in 1966 and 1967 and bronze in 1973. He also won the Soviet Cup in 1975-76.

Chetin set four bantamweight world records: one in the clean & jerk, and three in the total. After finishing his sporting career in the late 1970s Chetin decided to move to Uzbekistan at the invitation of a friend and worked there as a farmer and ferryman. In the early 1990s however, when Uzbekistan gained its independence from the Soviet Union, Chetin returned to weightlifting. He took up the new form of weightlifting which had gained popularity in the 1980s, powerlifting, and, despite being nearly 50-years-old, won gold at the 1992 European Powerlifting Championships in the lightweight class, taking bronze at the World Powerlifting Championships at the same year.

Shortly afterwards, in October 1921, he went to Burma, working with elephants as part of his job as a forestry assistant. Worthington-Eyre returned to England at the outbreak of World War II and joined the Royal Artillery. After the War he was stationed in Germany, where he remained until his retirement, when he returned to the family home at Invermoriston, in the Scottish Highlands.

67641,Hannes Kolehmainen,Male,9 December 1889,168.0,57-58, Finland,FIN,"Johan Pietari Kolehmainen, known to the sports world as Hannes Kolehmainen, was the first great distance runner of the Olympic Games. His fame is primarily based on his performances at the 1912 Olympics at which he won the gold medal in the 5,000 metres, the 10,000 metres, the individual cross-country race, and set an individual world record for 3,000 metres in the 3,000 metre team race. A joyous spirit with a seeming perpetual smile on his face, he was known as “Smiling Hannes”, in stark contrast to the later seemingly ever-suffering distance running legend, Emil Zátopek of Czechoslovakia. Hannes Kolehmainen was also the first great Finnish distance runner, setting the stage for many to follow him, including Paavo Nurmi, Ville Ritola, Albin Stenroos, Lauri Lehtinen, Volmari Iso-Hollo, and Lasse Virén. Kolehmainen was born on 9 December 1889 in Kuopio, near Lake Lalki. He was but one of four well-known distance running brothers. The others were August Wiljami (Willie), Kalle, and Taavetti Heikki (Tatu). His older brother, Willie, was the first to achieve international acclaim. Running as a professional, he set a world best for the marathon on 20 October 1912, in Vailsburg, New Jersey. Tatu Kolehmainen also competed in marathons, and led, or was near the lead, of the 1912 Olympic marathon past the halfway mark. The brothers had trained together growing up. In addition to running, they trained with cross-country skiing and several times skiied to Iisalmi, a town about 100 kilometres away, and returned the next day. Like his brothers, Hannes Kolehmainen began his running career competing in marathons. He ran his first marathon on 16 June 1907, finishing third in a race in Viipuri, Finland. Through 1909, he ran eight marathons, winning his final one on the track in Hanko, Finland, on 19 September 1909. His best time was 2-42:59, run on a track in Göteburg only two weeks earlier. But after 1909, Kolehmainen stopped running marathons, at least for several years. He then turned his attention to the track. Originally a member of the Kuopion Riento Club, Hannes Kolehmainen moved to Helsinki in 1909 and joined the well-known sports club Helsingin Kisa-Veikot. He ran for that club for several years, but switched to Helsingin Jyry, a workers’ association club, in early 1912. He was by then a renowned runner in his native Finland. In 1911 he had won 22 of 22 races, including the British AAA title over four miles, which was his first major international victory. In early 1912 he trained diligently, recording a solo time trial over three miles in 14:31.2 on 10 June, proving his fitness for Stockholm. In Stockholm, Kolehmainen became the first great Olympic distance runner. His Olympic efforts began on 7 July, when he won heat one of the 10,000 metres trial to qualify for the final. The next day, he won the 10,000 metres in 31:20.8, a new world record for the distance, and the first world record recognized by the IAAF for 10,000 metres. He won the race by 46 seconds over Lewis Tewanima (USA). The following day, Kolehmainen raced again, winning the fourth heat of round one of the 5,000 metres. On 10 July, Kolehmainen ran in the 5,000 final, in what was to become one of the greatest races in Olympic history. His main rival was the Frenchman, Jean Bouin. Together they set out at a fairly slow pace. But at 1,500 metres, Bouin took over the lead, and pushed the pace. Kolehmainen responded and ran on Bouin’s shoulder for the next several kilometres. At the beginning of the last lap, Kolehmainen made several attempts to pass Bouin, all to no avail until the final straightaway. Less than 50 metres from the line, Kolehmainen edged ahead briefly, but Bouin spurted, catching him, but never passing him. At the line, Kolehmainen won by less than half a metre. His time was 14:36.6, with Bouin running 14:36.7. Together they shattered the 15-minute barrier, and Kolehmainen’s new world record was almost 25 seconds faster than the previously recorded best (15:01.2 by Arthur Robertson [GBR] in 1908). Philip Noel-Baker later wrote, “Kolehmainen was happy and smiling, a generous competitor and a modest winner. Perhaps my personal affection for Kolehmainen makes me remember that 5,000 metres as the most exciting race I ever saw.” But Kolehmainen was far from finished in Stockholm. He had a day of rest, and then on 12 July, ran in the heats of the 3,000 metre team race. In heat one, there were only two teams, Finland and the United States. In an upset, the United States won the team contest and Finland did not qualify for the final. But it was hardly Kolehmainen’s fault - he won the race individually in 8:36.9, setting another world record for the distance. Three days later, the cross-country race was run, with medals awarded to both individuals and teams. Kolehmainen won again, covering the 12 kilometre course 33 seconds ahead of Hjalmar Andersson of the host country. Finland finished second as a team, allowing Kolehmainen to finish his Olympic efforts with three gold medals, one silver medal, and three world records. After the 1912 Olympic Games, Hannes Kolehmainen moved to the United States. There he competed for both the Irish-American Athletic Club, the Kaleva Athletic Club, and as an honorary member of the Finnish-American Athletic Club. In 1912, 1913, and 1915, he won AAU title over five miles. He also became a naturalized American citizen. In 1917, Hannes Kolehmainen returned to his first event, the marathon, running the Boston Marathon, but finishing only fourth. In 1920, Kolehmainen won the New York Marathon in 2-47:49.4. This was an Olympic qualifying race for the Americans, but three Finns living in the United States (Kolehmainen, Juho Tuomikoski, and Ville Kyrönen) used the race as their own qualifying race. The 1920 Olympic marathon course in Antwerp was the longest in Olympic history at 42.75 km. At 20 km. the lead pack consisted of Chris Gitsham (SAF), Auguste Broos (BEL), Kolehmainen, and Italy’s Ettore Blasi, with Estonia’s Jüri Lossman and another Finn, Juho Tuomikoski, close behind. Kolehmainen took the lead at the midpoint of the race and he and Gitsham ran together for almost 15 kilometres. Gitsham, however, was having problems with a leg injury and withdrew shortly thereafter. Kolehmainen by then was pulling away for what appeared would be an easy victory. His time of 2-32:25.8 was a world’s best mark for amateur runners. After Antwerp, Kolehmainen continued to compete as a runner, but mostly at longer distances, at which he set several world records. He returned to Finland and thereafter represented the Turun Urheiluliitto Club. On 10 October 1920, he set a world record for the 25 kilometre distance, running 1-26:29.8 in Tampere, Finland. He bettered that time with 1-25:20.0, also in Tampere, on 22 June 1922. Later that year, he broke the world record for 30 kilometres, running 1-47:13.4 in Viipuri on 1 October. Hannes Kolehmainen ran no marathons between 1920 and 1924. He did not run any of the Finnish Olympic marathon trials for 1924, but he ran a 27 kilometre solo trial in 1-35:00 shortly before the Olympics and convinced the Finnish selectors of his fitness. He was chosen to run the marathon in Paris, but did not finish the race. He ran one more marathon in his career. On 17 June 1928, he entered the Finnish Olympic trial in Kauhava, but again failed to finish. It was his last competition. Hannes Kolehmainen settled again in Finland, where he was revered. He made his living with various careers, including being an inspector, a clerk, a farmer, a mason, and finally, as a businessman. In 1952, when the Olympic Games were held in Helsinki, the Olympic Torch was brought into the stadium by Paavo Nurmi, the man who succeeded Kolehmainen as the greatest Finnish distance runner. Nurmi ran once around the track and then handed the torch to Hannes Kolehmainen, who lit the Olympic Flame in the stadium. Kolehmainen died in Helsinki on 11 January 1966. To the end, he was known as ‘Smiling Hannes’, the first of the Flying Finns.

In 1937 the nine- year-old appeared in the short film “Sunny Youth,” filmed in Arosa, in which her acting talents were discovered. In pair skating, Pawlik – together with her future husband and non-Olympian Rudi Seeliger – she won a series of youth and junior championships (always beating the future World Champions Andrea Kékesy / Ede Király of Hungary) and the Austrian (“Ostmark”) Championship in 1942. Seeliger had to join the German Army and became a POW on the Eastern Front, returning no earlier than December 1949. Therefore, Pawlik was only able to train as an individual skater, winning four national titles from 1946-49. When Austria was readmitted to international competitions in 1948, Pawlik immediately became the best European at the European Championships. The 1948 title, however, went to the Canadian Barbara Ann Scott, as non-Europeans were also allowed to compete. In the same year, Pawlik won two more silver medals, at the Olympics and at the World Championships. She finally won the European title in 1949 despite an appendicitis attack. At the World Championships she was the clear favorite but had to retire because her skate broke just before the long program, which gave rise to rumors of sabotage. By 1948 Pawlik had already been offered to appear in a Hollywood movie but at that time wanted to maintain her amateur status. In the summer of 1949 she turned professional and joined the Vienna Ice Revue. Her first leading role in a movie came in 1950 called “Spring on the Ice,” co-starring many Austrian film and theater celebrities of the time. At the Vienna Ice Revue Pawlik became the most celebrated European show skater since triple Olympic champion Sonja Henie, individually and with her husband Rudi Seeliger as a pair. She was famous for her elegance as well as for her acrobatic skills. In the movies )Dream Revue) (1959) and “Three Love Letters from Tyrol” (1962) Pawlik appeared again as an actress and figure skater. In the early 1960s Pawlik retired from skating, became a mother and started a career as the first female sports broadcaster on Austrian television. From 1963-72 she reported on all European and World Championships and all Olympic competitions in figure skating, which were major prime-time events at the time. In 1954 Pawlik acquired her PhD in German language and literature studies at Vienna University, her dissertation dealing with the poetry of Austrian writer Stephan von Millenkovich. From 1973-81 she worked as a teacher of German and English.

In the former he was second in his opening heat, behind Egon Henninger, but was eliminated in the semi-finals after finishing fifth. In the latter, he was fourth in his heat and his time was insufficient to qualify for the final. That same year he set a national record in the 100 m breaststroke. He received a degree in electrical engineering from Politehnica University of Timișoara in 1971, which led to his retirement from active competition.

In 1932, she took part in the demonstration speed skating events for women, which were conducted at the Winter Olympics held in Lake Placid. She reached the final – the events were conducted in mass start style – in two of the three events, taking third in the 500 and winning the 1,500 metres. In 1936, Klein took part in the first official World Championships for women, held in Stockholm (she had also competed in the unofficial World Championships organized in Oslo in 1935, where she won the 1,000 m). After the first day, Klein led the field after winning both the 500 and 3,000 metres, the latter in a new World Record time of 6:12.0. After placing third in the 1,000, she was paired with second-placed Verné Lesche, who needed to win by almost 12 seconds on the final distance, the 5,000 m. Lesche seemed to successfully complete her mission, as Klein trailed her by half a lap after about 4,000 m. However, Klein closed down the gap to become the first official women’s World Champion. After this title, Klein retired from skating by throwing her skates in the Atlantic Ocean on her way home from Europe. Klein’s titles also included four national and two North American titles (both indoor and outdoor) and two World Records. Klein later skated in an ice show (the Ice Follies) and married Dr. Outland.",Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the World Allround Speed Skating Championships (1–0–1 1935 Oslo bronze: Allround; 1936 Stockholm gold: Allround)

891138,Maurice Martin,Male,26 March 1861,,, France,FRA,"A graduate of the BEM Management School, Maurice Martin intended to enter the lucrative wine industry, but soon became fascinated with the development of the bicycle. Although best known in France as a journalist and author, he was also an avid and professional cycling competitor. It was in this capacity that he attended the 1900 Summer Olympics and competed in the national team sprint for professionals alongside an individual recorded only as Courtet. Together they were eliminated in the opening heat by eventual winners Pierre Chevalier and Rollin. Martin’s love for cycling, however, extended far beyond active competition and he was essential to the development and success of the inaugural Bordeaux–Paris race in 1891. He was also a member of the steering committee for the Union Vélocipédique de France and founded both the cycling publication Véloce-Sport and the Véloce-Club Bordelaise in the 1880s. Outside of cycling, Martin was involved in writing about and promoting numerous sports, including rugby, equestrian, wrestling, boxing, and football, and was also interested in the development of aviation and the automobile. He penned articles and opinion pieces for numerous publications, authored many works of his own, and in 1905 was responsible for the naming of the Côte d’Argent section of the French Atlantic coast, due to his involvement with the promotion of tourism. He was inducted into the Legion d’Honneur in 1921 for his contributions to physical education in the military and was promoted to the rank of Officer in 1932. He received the Gold Medal of the Union Française des œuvres Laïques d’éducation Physique in 1929 and his bust was placed in the Bordeaux Sports Park in 1939, two years prior to his death.",
