In 2002 at Salt Lake City she came home with a silver in the combined and a bronze in the downhill, her only Olympic medals. Her record at the World Championships was much more impressive as she won nine medals at Worlds, including three golds, with a combined gold at Sestriere in 1997, a downhill at Vail in 1999, and a team gold at Åre in 2007.

While at Harvard, the twins, assisted by classmate Divya Narendra, started a college social networking internet site, originally called Harvard Connection, later known as ConnectU. They asked Mark Zuckerberg to join them and help expand the site to other colleges. Zuckerberg made this wildly successful, as ConnectU was the forerunner of Facebook. The four had an oral agreement about how they would split the profits. The Winklevosses were eventually bought out by Zuckerberg for $59 million, after they sued him for breaking their oral contract. But they filed a further suit seeking more money. In March 2011 that suit came to trial with the judge finding against the Winklevosses in April 2011. In total, the Winklevoss twins received $65 million from Zuckerberg in one of the most famous legal battles in history. They invested $11 million in Bitcoin, and as their value rose from $120 per coin to $10,000 in 2017, so did the twins’ investment, to over $1.3 billion.

Domestically, Vyrupayev never won a Soviet title, but besides his 1954 Greco-Roman bantamweight bronze, he won Greco-Roman bantamweight silvers in 1955-1957, Greco-Roman featherweight silver in 1960 and Greco-Roman featherweight bronzes in 1961 and 1962. After finishing his sporting career, Vyrupayev worked as a wrestling coach in his native Irkutsk, his most famous pupil being 1988 European champion in Greco-Roman bantamweight Aleksandr Shestakov. Since 1990 an international tournament in his honor has been held in Irkutsk.",

He represented England at the 2006 Commonwealth Games and at the 2007 World Championships where he was a quarter finalist thereby earning a place at the Beijing Olympics. At the 2008 Games he narrowly defeated his first opponent on countback after the bout ended five points apiece then beat a Hungarian on his way to the last four and a guaranteed Olympic medal. Jeffries could not match the accuracy of Ireland’s Kenny Egan in the semi-finals and had to settle for a bronze medal. This was his last fight as an amateur and he had his first professional fight in February 2009. Despite being hampered by a tendency to cut easily and having problems with his hands that eventually required surgery he is, as of early 2012, unbeaten in his professional career. He is also a qualified fitness instructor who has worked extensively in Britain and the United States.",

His career on the national team lasted barely a matter of weeks as a dispute between the skier and the Canadian coaching setup over his involvement in an internet company led to Begg-Smith abandoning Canada in favour of Australia. He did not compete in the 2001-02 and 2002-03 seasons but instead trained with the Australian squad whilst he served his residency qualification. Granted an Australian passport in 2003 he returned to competition in December of that year and broke into the top ten of a World Cup race in only his third race of his comeback. Begg-Smith continued his ascent of the world rankings in 2004-05 and, although he failed to win an event, he was a regular visitor to the podium and took the bronze in moguls at the World Championships in Finland. He made the breakthrough to the top step of the podium at a World Cup event in Oberstdorf in December 2005 and then went on a run of success that saw him win four of five events immediately preceding the Torino Olympics. With such a run of recent success and with his name at the top of the world rankings he was seen as the favourite for the gold medal and he lived up to that billing as he qualified for the final in first place and maintained the position in the final to became the first representative of a Southern Hemisphere nation to win an Olympic title on snow. He continued his form into the 2006-07 season, retained his World Cup moguls title and added two World Championship medals to his collection when he won the gold in the dual mogul discipline and silver in the regular mogul event. A third World Cup title followed in 2007-08 but he suffered a cruciate ligament injury in early 2009 and was not able to defend his World Championship. His business ventures have proved successful and he was reported to have earned a considerable personal fortune. The exact nature of his business is a subject for debate but press reports have centred on the distribution of spyware, spam and “pop-under” internet advertising. His older brother Jason followed Dale to Australia and competed alongside him at the 2006 Winter Games","Brother of Jason Begg-Smith Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the World Freestyle Ski Championships (1–1–1 2005 Ruka bronze: moguls; 2007 Madonna di Campiglio gold: dual moguls, silver: moguls)"

During that final year he was invited to play two playoff matches with the Kitchener-Waterloo Dutchmen as they made their bid for Canada’s Allan Cup, given annually to the senior men’s ice hockey champions. The Dutchmen lost the tournament but were impressed with McKnight and the following year he joined the team in earnest and stayed with them for two seasons. In addition, he and his team were invited to represent Canada at the 1960 Winter Olympics, where they ended up taking home silver in the ice hockey tournament. McKnight played in only two games, but scored just as many goals. In 1960 he joined the Senior Ontario Hockey Association’s Galt Terriers and, with them, won his first Allan Cup. This led to an invitation to represent Canada at the 1962 World Championships, which the team accepted. They borrowed McKnight’s former Dutchmen teammate Jack Douglas from the Chatham Maroons and took home a silver medal for their country. The Terriers were renamed the Hornets in 1963 and McKnight stuck with them until 1965, when he took a year off of the sport. He returned in 1966 with the Guelph Regals, but played only 14 games before hanging up his skates for good.

It was one of many championships that he won, and included eight U.S. National single sculls titles, six Canadian single sculls championships, and two gold medals at the Pan American Games - single sculls in 1955 and double sculls in 1959 with Bill Knecht. Kelly, Jr. won the Diamond Sculls again in 1949, and was world singles champion in that year. At the Olympics, John, Jr. was not quite able to grab the gold ring, but at the 1956 Olympics, though probably a bit past his peak as a single sculler, he put on an outstanding performance to take the bronze behind Russia’s Vyacheslav Ivanov, and Australia’s Stuart Mackenzie. John Kelly, Jr. was very active in sports administration, especially in rowing. He served as a president of the AAU, president of the USOC, and president of the International Swimming Hall of Fame.

A week later, at the Final Trials, Porter won again and Dillard failed to finish. But he made the Olympic team by placing third in the 100 m and then took the Olympic title. Four years later he made no mistakes, winning the hurdles at Helsinki, and winning the gold on the sprint relay team for a second time. Originally inspired by the victory parade in his native Cleveland for Jesse Owens after the 1936 Olympics, Dillard developed into one of the most consistent hurdlers the world has ever seen. Owens encouraged Dillard to take up hurdling and later gave him the spikes he had worn in Berlin. Dillard went on to win 14 AAU titles and six NCAA championships, while attending Baldwin-Wallace College, as well as setting world records in both the high and low hurdles. Dillard was a sharpshooter with the famed Buffalo Soldiers, the 92nd Infantry Division, which were African-American troops who fought valiantly in the Italian campaign from 1943-45 during World War II.

She also won silver in the 80 metre hurdles. At Melbourne in 1956, Díaz made history as the first female Cuban athlete to compete at the Olympic Games.

After failing to win a medal at the 1960 Roma Olympics, Díaz won both the hurdles and long jump gold medals, as well as a relay silver medal, at the 1962 Central American and Caribbean Games at Kingston, Jamaica. Díaz was en route to San Juan, Puerto Rico for the 1966 Central American and Caribbean Games but was not allowed to disembark the ship Cerro Pelado following a decision made by the Cuban sports authorities.

She lived in Miami, and worked as a physical education teacher. She also worked as a therapist and massage therapist, with many of her clients having been fans of hers.

Barely a teenager, he started breaking Scottish junior records, and in 1949 won four senior individual Scottish titles, and the national relay title, with Motherwell. The following year, Waldrop became the first male swimmer to win three British titles at one meeting. As at the end of 1952, he had won British titles at all freestyle distances, and broken 32 British and Scottish records. Having competed at the 1948 London Olympics as a 16-year-old, Waldrop was captain of the British men’s swimming team at Helsinki four years later. Shortly after the 1952 Olympics, Jack and his twin brother Bert, headed to the University of Michigan where they studied for four years. Jack soon started breaking US swimming records, and at New Haven, Connecticut in April 1954, he became the first Briton to break a swimming world record for 21 years, and the first Scot ever to do so, when he set a time of 4:41.7 for the 400 yards individual medley. Later that year, Waldrop went on to win his only international medals, at the Vancouver British Empire and Commonwealth Games, when, representing Scotland, he won silver in the 440 yards freestyle and a bronze medal as part of the 3 x 110 yards medley relay with his brother Bert and John Service. In 1955 Jack lowered his own 400 individual medley record to 4:36.9, and also set a new world record for the 220 yards freestyle at 2:03.9, reducing it by half a second, at Columbus, Ohio, a week later. He won NCAA 220 yard freestyle titles in 1954 and 1955. Waldrop returned from the United States in September 1956, and was originally selected for his third Olympics at Melbourne, then dropped, and then days later, re-instated. Amidst all the mayhem Waldrop announced his retirement from swimming, before announcing his comeback. Having graduated from Michigan with a degree in creative writing, Jack returned to the USA and took a three-year law degree, before opening his own advertising agency with just $40 in his pocket. When he retired, and sold the company, it had a $10 million turnover and employed 27 people. Jack spent more than 50 years living in the United States, mostly in the Chicago area, After setting his first world record, Jack Wardrop was widely hailed as being the “world’s best swimmer” but, modestly, Jack maintained he wasn’t even the best swimmer “in his house”, as that honour belonged to brother Bert. Jack Waldrop was inducted into the Scottish Sports Hall of Fame in 2004, and into the Scottish Swimming Hall of Fame in 2010.","Twin brother of Bert Wardrop Listed in Olympians Who Set a European Record in Long Course Swimming (200 m freestyle – 4 March 1955 - 1 May 1957: 2:03.4 (4 March 1955; Columbus, USA)) Listed in Olympians Who Set a World Record in Long Course Swimming (200 m freestyle – 4 March 1955 - 8 March 1957: 2:03.4 (4 March 1955; Columbus, USA)) Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the British Empire/Commonwealth Games (0–1–1 1954 Vancouver SWI silver: 440 yards freestyle, bronze: 3×110 yards medley (competed for Scotland))"

920432,Winifred Austen,Female,12 July 1876,,, Great Britain,GBR,"Winifred Austen was well known for her paintings of animals. Her work ranged from exotic animals at the Zoological Gardens in Regent’s Park to those creatures that lived freely in the British countryside, notably small birds. She also produced illustrations for books, magazines, and postcards with animal motifs. Although born in Ramsgate the daughter of a naval surgeon, her family moved to Hornsey, London in 1892 and she attended the London County Council School of Arts and Crafts studying under Cuthbert Swan, who was well known for his paintings of animals. She painted in oils and watercolour and, because of her interest in working in the media, she also became an exponent of etchings and dry-point engraving. Etching was popular in Britain at the turn of the 20th century and Austen was inspired by the twins Charles and Edward Detmold. She first exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1899 and over the next 62 years had more than 70 pictures exhibited at the Academy. Winifred was elected to the Society of Women’s Artists in 1902 and the following year she became a fellow of the Royal Zoological Society. She was elected to the Royal Society of Painter, Etchers and Engravers in 1907 and to the Royal Institute of Painters in Water Colours in 1933. The world famous ornithologist and Olympic sailor Sir Peter Scott described Austen as the “the best bird-etcher of this century.” Amongst others, she illustrated the book Birds Ashore and Aforeshore, published in 1935. In her long career she made around 200 of her own plates. She moved out of London after marrying the her American-born agent Oliver Frick in 1917. They lived in Yeovil in Somerset and Dorking in Surrey before moving to Suffolk in 1922 where Oliver died the following year but Winfred kept working until late in life. Austen created several versions for most bird species, some in different techniques. Therefore, her submitted works cannot be clearly identified. In the catalog, only Mallards in the Creek is clearly defined as an etching. However, it can be assumed that Lapwing and Snipe were also etchings.",

His finest moment came in 1947 when, in front of a capacity crowd at Dublin’s National Stadium, he defeated the more favoured Englishman Gerry Scriven to become Ireland’s first European Champion in the heavyweight class. He was nine times champion of Ireland, twice in the light-heavyweight division, and then a record seven titles followed after moving up to heavyweight. He took part in approximately 200 fights and won 180 of them but lost his opening bout at the 1948 Olympics and had retired by the Helsinki Games. Gearóid Ó Colmáin was considering a comeback in 1954 when he lost his right eye after a piece of metal flew up from the anvil and struck him.

He experienced a severe psychological crisis around 1913, as a teenager. He was silent for a year and had suicidal intentions. Pauser first began to study architecture and then changed to Fine Arts, studying from 1919-24 at the Academy of Fine Arts in München. During this time he was influenced primarily by the work of the famous German painters Max Beckmann, Otto Dix and Karl Hofer. In 1925 he returned to Wien (Vienna) and further studied for a year at the local Academy of Arts under Karl Sterrer. In 1927 Pauser became a member of the Wien Secession. The critics and Austrian society respected his portraits, and in 1932 he was awarded the Austrian state prize. His works from his objective phase in the late 1920s and early 1930s were of particular importance. After World War II he was much in demand as a portraitist and firmly integrated in the Austrian art scene, receiving many commissions for portraits of politicians and actors, and he received numerous awards and honors. Pauser’s two most important works were Der Österreichische Staatsvertrag (The Austrian Independence Treaty) because of its historical dimension, as well as the painting Am Hochofen (At the smelting furnace) for showing the working conditions of metal workers and representing the socially critical dimension of his work. During the Nazi period he was regarded as a degenerate artist, whose paintings were suspended “wrathfully” by Adolf Hitler personally at a 1937 München exhibition. In 1944 Pauser was imprisoned in a camp near Radkersburg. From 1927 to 1930, Pauser painted at least three pictures showing Tennis Courts with players. It can be assumed that the work dated 1927 (oil on canvas, 45 x 57 cm) is the one shown in Amsterdam the following year. Horse Jumping is documented by an illustration in the 1936 art catalog. It was painted in 1935 as an oil painting on canvas (73 x 92 cm).",

She competed at the 1960 Roma Olympics when she was only 12 years and 227 days, making her one of the youngest participants in the history of the Games and the third youngest Italian Olympian after the gymnasts Luigina Giavotti and Ines Vercesi, who competed at Amsterdam in 1928. Marcellini began swimming at the age of nine as she spent four months a year at the seaside with her parents. In just three years she competed at the Olympics, helped by the fact that her club, Circolo Canottieri Aniene (her father was the first President of the swimming sector) needed an athlete in the breaststroke event and Marcellini switched to that stroke from freestyle. CONI decided that, being the youngest athlete at the Games, she would have the prestigious role of carrying the Italian flag at the Opening Ceremony. At the last moment, Giulio Onesti, President of CONI, told her that because her individual event would take place the following day, she should not march in the parade of athletes or carry the flag. In 1961 Marcellini broke the Italian record, ranking fifth on the year list for the 200 breaststroke. No other Italian swimmer had ever been in the top 10 in the world until then in breaststroke. In addition to swimming, Luciana married a few times, once even to an English Lord. In 1992 she was chosen as one of the world’s 10 most elegant women. In recent years she has dedicated herself to the practice and organization of rowing competitions. In 2019 she received the Milano Trophy for education and culture for young people.",

922552,John Milne,Male,19 July 1879,,, Great Britain,GBR,"After two years at University College Dundee, John Bell Milne went to Edinburgh University in 1904, from where he qualified as a dentist in 1908. During his time at college in Dundee he established himself as a fine gymnast and high jumper as a member of the Dundee Gymnastic and Athletic Club. As a gymnast, he represented Dundee in the prestigious Adams Shield at the turn of the 20th century and also competed for Scotland in the annual triangular match against England and Ireland. Having won the Scottish high jump titles several times, Milne was involved in a three-way tie to share the 1904 English AAAs title with Ireland’s Peter O’Connor and R. G. Murray (West of Scotland). Milne worked at the Dundee Dental Hospital and School, and set up the Dundee Dental Club to help break down the barrier between newly qualified dentists and their more experienced counterparts. In the 1920s, Milne moved to London to take up a post at King’s College Hospital as a director of dental studies. He retired in 1948, after more than 20 years working at King’s, and then returned north to Dundee. At the turn of the 20th century, Milne was a friend of British aviation pioneer Preston Watson, a fellow Scottish athlete and gymnast, who it was strongly believed for many years made the first powered flight five months before Wilbur and Orville Wright made their historic flight.

Due to Canada’s boycott of those Games, however, she had to wait until the 1982 Commonwealth Games to make her international breakthrough, which she accomplished by winning gold in the 4x400 metre relay (alongside Charmaine Crooks, Jill Richardson-Briscoe, and Angella Taylor-Issajenko) and silver in the 4x100 metre relay (with Taylor, Angela Bailey, and Marita Payne Wiggins). The following year she won silver in the 400 metres at the Summer Universiade and was eliminated in the heats of the same event at the World Championships, while taking silver in the 4x400 m relay at the Pan American Games.

He then played in three consecutive Olympic Winter Games 1928-36 and won the bronze medal with Germany in 1932 at Lake Placid. He grew up to be the most popular German ice hockey player in the 1920s and 1930s. He was also an excellent tennis player, playing five times for the German Davis Cup team and winning the 1932 German Championship in men’s singles. He also teamed up in doubles with three-time Wimbledon finalist Baron Gottfried von Cramm. Jaenecke is often considered the best German ice hockey player of all-time. He was a huge star in Europe, mainly in the 1930’s, and immensly popular back home in Germany where he almost attained the same popularity as heavyweight boxing champion Max Schmeling. Between 1926 and 1937 Jaenecke won multiple German ice hockey titles with Berlin and was twice a Spengler Cup winner. In 1944 he won his 10th German title with Berliner SC/SC Brandenburg. He played both left wing and defense, often playing the entire 60 minutes in games, causing even the Canadians to praise his strength. After World War II he moved to Garmisch-Partenkirchen, joined SC Riessersee and won three further national titles, playing competitively until 1951. Jaenecke was inducted into the International Ice Hockey Hall of Fame in Toronto in 1998 and the German Sport Hall of Fame in 2008. His autobiography, Jagd hinter dem Puck, was published in 1939. Jaenecke had a shoemaker shop, a line of work that his father had. After the war he lost property in Berlin, and in 1951 he was employed as the general manager of a casino in Bad Neuenahr where he later lost all his money as he invested (as an owner) in the business himself. Jaenecke married the former Lisa von Dobeneck, after her divorce from Baron von Cramm, although Jaenecke and Lisa also later divorced. Jaenecke battled bad health for the last couple of years and passed away one week after his 77th birthday in Bonn, Germany.","Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the European Ice Hockey Championships (2–0–5 1927 Wien bronze; 1930 Chamonix, Berlin, and Wien gold; 1933 Praha bronze; 1934 Milano gold; 1936 Garmisch-Partenkirchen (Olympics) bronze; 1938 Praha bronze; 1939 Zürich and Basel bronze) Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the World Ice Hockey Championships (0–1–2 1930 Chamonix, Berlin and Wien silver; 1932 Lake Placid (Olympics) bronze; 1934 Milano bronze)"

His aim was to send the German Swimming Federation to Paris to contest the world’s best. Hax nominated for the water polo team Max Hainle from Stuttgart and Ernst Hoppenberg from Bremen, who were already chosen as swimmers for Paris. Other participants were Gustav Lexau (Berliner Schwimm Club “Trout”), Fritz Scheider (Poseidon Berlin), Paul Gebauer (Berlin SV von 1878), and Hans Aniol (Amateur SC Berlin).

At her best in the power races, Moser-Pröll won silver medals in downhill and giant slalom at the 1972 Winter Olympics. In that era Olympic events were considered World Championships, so that gave her two World medals, but she added a third with a gold medal in the non-Olympic combined event in 1972. Her first World medal had been a bronze in downhill at Gröden in 1970. She later won downhill World titles in 1974 and 1978, and at the 1978 Worlds in Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Moser-Pröll won three medals, adding a victory in the combined and a bronze medal in GS. Moser-Pröll capped her career by finally winning Olympic gold with a victory in the downhill at Lake Placid in 1980. Despite the Olympic and World Championships record, Moser-Pröll’s cemented her place in skiing history with her World Cup performances. Through 2013, she still holds records for the most World Cup race wins, with 62, and podiums, with 114. She was a six-time overall World Cup champion, the most ever for men or women, winning the seasonal title in 1971-75 and 1979. In event seasonal World Cups, Moser-Pröll won 13 crystal globes, with seven in downhill (1971-75, 1978-79), three in giant slalom (1971-72, 1975), one in slalom (1979), and two in the combined (1975, 1979). Annemarie Moser-Pröll retired from ski racing after a sixth place in a giant slalom at Saint-Gervais-les-Bains in March 1980. During her career she won 18 Austrian titles, with eight in giant slalom. During her break from racing in 1975-76, Moser-Pröll opened a restaurant, Café Annemarie, in Kleinarl, where her trophy collection was on display. She managed this through 2008, when she sold it and retired. Honors were numerous during her career and afterwards. She was Austrian Sportswoman of the Year in 1973-75, and 1977-80, was later chosen as Austrian Sportswoman of the Century, and was the World Winter Female Athlete of the 20th Century.

In 1897 and 1899 he won both sprints at the Australasian Championships, a bi-annual meeting that brought together the best athletes from Australia and New Zealand; at the second meeting, at Brisbane in November 1899, he equaled the Australian 100 yards record of 9.9 and set a new Australian record of 22.2 for 220 yards. Although the Australian authorities decided not to send a team to the 1900 Paris Olympics, sufficient funds were raised by private subscription to enable Rowley to go to Europe. Taking five months leave from his job as a stockkeeper, he arrived in London in June and, after reaching the final of the AAA 100 yards, the English Association agreed to pay his expenses to Paris. At the Olympics, he finished third in each of the three sprints. Medals were not awarded in all events at the 1900 Games and Rowley was presented with a carriage clock, a ladies’ purse, and a silver paper knife. He also ran in the 5,000 metres team race, through some unusual circumstances. The French officials insisted that although only four runners were to count in the scoring, teams must consist of five runners, each of whom must complete the race. With Alfred Tysoe, Charles Bennett, Jack Rimmer, and Sidney Robinson available, Britain’s victory seemed assured if only they could find a fifth runner. Apparently the three British marathon runners were not available. The Anglo-Indian sprinter Norman Pritchard was asked to make up the team but declined because of injury; and the French officials ruled out the Canadian winner of the steeplechase, George Orton; although they accepted the entry of Stan Rowley. The authorities apparently rejected Orton but accepted Rowley because he was entered from the Amateur Athletic Association (AAA). When the event finally started, Rowley jogged the first lap, then started walking and the officials, recognizing the absurdity of the situation, permitted him to retire. Rowley finally arrived back in Sydney in October and announced his retirement. After a brief return to racing in 1905, he served as honorary treasurer of the Australian AAU from 1908 to 1924. As a young man, he was an active rugby footballer and in his later years a keen golfer and cricketer, being honored with membership of the exclusive cricket club, I Zingari.

He was also noted for his gentlemanly play, always finishing amongst the least-penalized players in the NHL. The high point of his career came in the 1987 playoffs, when his outstanding play helped carry Philadelphia to the 1987 Stanley Cup Finals, as his 27 points were fourth in overall scoring and his 20 assists second to only Wayne Gretzky. In 1991, Eklund won the Bobby Clarke Trophy as the Flyer’s most valuable player. Eklund was traded to the Dallas Stars at the end of the 1993-94 season, but played only five games with them before returning to Europe. Eklund finished his career with Leksands IF from 1994-99.

Internationally, Eklund was capped 126 times with the Swedish national team. He won Olympic bronze in 1984 and was on six World Championships teams, winning gold in 1991 and silvers in 1986, 1990 and 1995.

Miller took a serious interest in competitive shooting in 1871 and in 1874 was a member of the Irish team which visited the United States. In the match against the Americans, Millner began with a bulls-eye but unfortunately it was on the wrong target and the four points deduced for Millner’s error virtually cost the Irish the match as the host country won by only three points. Jerry Millner visited America again in 1887 when the British team lost the Palma Match at Creedmore by 93 points. He also represented Ireland in the Elcho Match for thirty years and captained the team in 1919, although he did not actually compete that year.

The modern Olympics revived the legend in 1896 and, sadly, a death also occurred in an Olympic marathon. Francisco Lázaro, Portugal’s best long-distance runner at the time of the 1912 Stockholm Olympics, was the victim. A winner of the 1910 Lisboa marathon and Portuguese national champion from 1910-12, Lázaro was used to running in hot circumstances, like on the day of the Stockholm marathon. He thought he could improve his performance by not sweating and greased up his body for the race. This had an adverse effect, as his body could not cool down. Just after the half-way point, Lázaro fell for the first time, and stopped walking straight. After 30 kilometers, he eventually collapsed, and did not get up. A doctor was quickly at the scene, and the unconscious marathon runner was quickly carried to the Seraphim hospital. He was taken in with a body temperature of 41 degrees Celsius. Intensive care all through the night could not revive him, and he died around 6 AM, causing a shock to the other athletes and the general public. The following weekend, a memorial service was held in the Olympic Stadium, with 23,000 in attendance. Some $3800 was collected for Lázaro’s wife, and a monument was placed at the marathon’s turning point at Sollentuna. In Portugal, his funeral was attended by thousands. Although always known as Francisco Lázaro, it turns out that he was baptized Francisco da Silva and “Chico do Lázaro” was only a nickname.

Recent research has revealed, however, that Alastair Ivan Ladislaus Lucidus Evans was an American, the son of well-known Parisian-based American dentist, Dr. John Henry Evans. Viscount d’Oyley is not known to have represented any French club in 1900 fencing, so he is likely best termed an American entrant. John Evans followed his uncle, Dr. Thomas Wiltberger Evans, to Paris. Thomas Evans had become famous as a dental surgeon to nobility and was able to amass a fortune in Parisian real estate. John Evans moved from his native Baltimore to Paris in an attempt to set up a similar lucrative dental practice. He succeeded, working on Pope Leo XIII, who bestowed on him the title of Marquis d’Oyley. John Evans also stole several of his uncle’s patients, however, and after he succeeded to the nobility, enjoyed riding around in Paris in a magnificent carriage with a coat of arms and yellow-stockinged footmen. His uncle promptly disowned him and wrote him out of the will. Due to his father’s titles, Ivan Evans was also bestowed as the Viscount d’Oyley. In 1904 he took up with the Peruvian Madame Pflucker, who he met in Vichy. They sojourned to Cannes, and stayed on the Riviera for some time together, against John Evans’ protests. The father cut Ivan off any income and the couple returned to Paris, staying at the Hotel de Rivoli. There, Viscount d’Oyley died, the victim of a self-inflicted gunshot wound. The original story was that this was a suicide attempt, although later reports from his father stated he did not die by his own hand. Madame Pflucker confirmed the suicide theory, producing two letters he had addressed to authorities stating he intended to commit suicide.",Listed in Olympians Who Committed Suicide (Died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound.)

69104,Wyndham Halswelle,Male,30 May 1882,,, Great Britain,GBR,"After a notable athletic career at Charterhouse and the RMC, Sandhurst Wyndham Halswelle was commissioned into the Highland Light Infantry in 1901. While the Regiment was in South Africa, Halswelle’s ability was noticed by Jimmy Curran, a former professional athlete who later coached at Mercersburg Academy in Pennsylvania, where he guided the great James “Ted” Meredith to Olympic honors in 1912. When the HLI returned to Edinburgh from the Boer War, Curran persuaded his young subaltern to take up the sport in earnest. The results were quick and encouraging and in his first year of serious competition, Halswelle won the 1904 Army 880 yards championship. In 1905 he turned to quarter-miling and won the AAA and Scottish titles in addition to finishing first in the Scotland vs. Ireland match. The following year, Halswelle won medals in both the 400 and 800 metres at the Olympic Games in Athens and, on his return for the British season, he won the 100 yards, 220 yards, 440 yards and the 880 yards – all on the same afternoon – at the Scottish Championships. Halswelle also won the 1906 AAA 440 yards title in 48.8 seconds, which was easily his finest performance to date. After winning the 100 yards and 200 yards at the 1907 Scottish Championships, Halswelle broke down in the 440 yards and did not complete again that summer but in the Olympic year of 1908 he soon showed that the setback was behind him. He set a world record of 31.2 seconds for 300 yards and then posted a British 440 yards record of 48.4 seconds before facing the work’s best at the Olympic Games. Halswelle had the fastest time in both the heats and the semi-finals and in the final he faced three Americans, John Carpenter, William Robbins and John B. Taylor. The race was not run in lanes and the starter warned the runners against jostling, but subsequently events were to show that the warning was not heeded. Coming into the home-straight, Halswelle made a move to pass Carpenter who responded by starting on a crab-like course across the track and within 30 metres he had forced Halswelle to within 18 inches of the outside edge of the track. At this point, one of the umpires signaled to the judges to break the tape and after an hour of deliberation a verdict of “No Race” was declared and Carpenter was disqualified. A re-run, in lanes this time, was ordered but Robbins and Taylor, who were both entitled to compete, sided with Carpenter and refused to run, so Halswelle appeared alone and won the 1908 Olympic 400 metre title on a walk-over. He thus became the first Briton to win gold, silver and bronze medals in individual Olympic events. The whole incident soured Halswelle’s attitude of the sport and, as he was also under pressure from his senior officers, who felt he was being exploited, Halswelle made a farewell appearance at the 1908 Glasgow Rangers Sport and never ran again. At the age of 32, Captain Halswelle was killed in action in France. On 12 March he was wounded in the Battle of Neuve Chapell in France. Despite his injuries he refused to be evacuated and just over a week later, while attempting to rescue a fellow officer, he was killed when shot through the head by a sniper’s bullet. For his actions he was mentioned in dispatches. Halswelle was one of 80 members of his Regiment killed during an attempt to gain just 15 yards of ground. Whilst both Halswelle and his father were born in England, Wyndham was referred to as being Scottish, probably because his maternal grandfather, Major-General Gordon, was born in Hamilton, Scotland. Halswelle’s own father Keeley was a famous artist and illustrator of books for the Illustrated London News, and for the likes of poets Byron and Wordsworth. He died when Wyndham was just nine. In 2003 Wyndham Halswelle was inducted into the Scottish Sports Hall of Fame.

She never reached the final of an ASA junior event, but had already won two international races for Britain when she won her first national title in 1955. A successful round of internationals galas and the retention of her ASA title in the summer of 1956 secured her place in the team for Melbourne Olympics. At the Games, Judy won the 100 metres backstroke in 1:12.9 seconds, which was the first world long-course record for the event, and she was the first British woman swimmer to win an Olympic gold medal for 32 years. As a relief from the pressures of world class backstroke swimming, Judy Grinham turned to the freestyle event in 1957, winning the ASA 200 yards title, but the following year she reverted to her former style and enjoyed an outstanding season. At the Commonwealth Games she won the 100 yards backstroke with a new world record of 1:11.9 seconds and this was also ratified as a record for the marginally shorter 100 metres distance. She then won a second gold medal and shared in a second world record in the medley relay, before completing her medial haul with a bronze in the freestyle relay. Later in the season, she won the 100 metres backstroke at the European Championships to become the first woman ever to hold the Olympic, European and Commonwealth titles. At the European Championships she also won a silver medal in the freestyle relay and bronze medals in the individual 100 metres freestyle and the medley relay.

920574,Hermann Alker,Male,13 March 1885,,, Germany,GER,"Hermann Alker studied architecture at the University of Karlsruhe, and in 1919 became an assistant there as a Regierungsbaumeister (Master Builder of the Government). In 1919 he received his doctorate and received his habilitation there, and in 1924, was awarded a professorship. In 1935 Alker was employed as a city councilor in Durlach, and in 1936, received the Gauleiter of Baden Culture Prize. In 1937 and 1938 Alker was Stadtbaurat (Town Builder) with special tasks in München, but was soon replaced because of disagreements with Adolf Hitler, although he received a professorship in Karlsruhe. After World War II, the military government ended his Higher Education Service career because of his Nazi past, forcing his retirement in 1950, after which he worked as a self-employed architect. His early buildings were characterized by traditional design, but later the influence of modernity is recognizable. From 1924–34, Alker designed the stadium of the Technical University in Karlsruhe and almost contemporaneously, (1927-28), the stadium of the University of Freiburg im Breisgau, his two entries for the 1928 art competition. Both were built with visible clinker brickworks. The stadium and its facilities in Freiburg have been considerably enhanced through time, but it’s still in use and the main building constructed by Alker is preserved. The old university stadium in Karlsruhe vanished under new buildings but the historic grandstand building with the integrated training hall was renovated in 1994-95. In 1934/35 Alker built, on behalf of the National Socialists, a so-called “Thingstätte” (assembly site) in Heidelberg and, shortly thereafter, designed another one for Karlsruhe. The “mountain stadium with hero’s painting” is probably also a kind of Thingstätte. In 1934, Alker was commissioned to replace the existing monument for Leo Schlageter, a Nazi martyr, with a much larger one in his hometown of Schönau in the southern Black Forest. While initially a Thingstätte, it was planned to accommodate 15,000 people, but later was changed to an arena. The model provided a parade ground of 100 x 75 m and a kind of sanctuary in the style of Stonehenge on the Lötzberg mountain, with construction beginning in 1937. The monument, however, remained unfinished; the remains of the base are still visible.",

65853,Margaret George,Female,13 September 1937,,, Canada,CAN,"Having been born in a log cabin on a farm in Mervin, Saskatchewan, Margaret George lived her life under the philosophy that it is not where you come from in life that is important, but where you go. Born into a family that would eventually grow to four girls, she looked up to her father and was interested in sport from a young age. Rural life in Saskatchewan provided her ample opportunities to train physically, including her daily walk to school, which was 2.5 miles away, and splitting wood to help heat the family’s home. In her younger days she played soccer with the boys and was successful in fastball as a catcher, alongside her older, pitching sister, and sometimes played up to three games a day in local championships. George discovered her true passion, however, in Grade 8, when Saskatchewan provincial representatives were going to small towns to introduce discus, javelin, and shot put. Recommended to the reps by her principal Ed Nelson, she took up field athletics and was soon a rising provincial star. During Grade 12, the high school record for the javelin throw, her best event, was 102 feet, but George won the title that year with a throw of 120 feet. This caught the attention of Joe Griffiths of Saskatoon, who was already well-known for his successfully training of provincial athletes. He sent her to a summer physical education program at the Young Women’s Christian Association in Saskatoon. George then took part in the Saskatchewan Athletics’ annual summer track meet, from which 10 athletes would be sent to Toronto for the Canadian Track and Field Association’s Canadian Olympic Training Program. Following the conclusion of the program, she travelled to Hamilton for the trials for the 1956 Melbourne Olympics. There, she set a record of 44.42 metres (145.5 feet), breaking the previous record of 131 feet, thus qualifying her for the Games. Unfortunately, she could not match this at the Olympics and was eliminated in the qualifying round. Following this, George attended teacher’s college and began coaching discus, javelin, and shot put. She taught in Harris, Saskatchewan for three years before marrying a wealthy farmer, George Tosh. She then coached at a local high school for over 20 years on a volunteer basis and eventually became certified as a Level 2 course conductor with the Saskatchewan Provincial Physical Educational Institute Association, which allowed her to coach other coaches. Her reputation grew quickly as she held provincial field clinics and served as a field referee, in addition to her responsibilities on the family farm, where at one time they were raising over 1000 sheep. Tosh remains athletically active into her 80s and was planning to attend the World Masters Athletics Championships before they were cancelled by the COVID-19 pandemic. Prior to this, she had set numerous World Masters’ records in different age categories for the javelin, discus, shot put, weight throw, and hammer throw. Although she holds more records in the weight throw, the hammer throw is her favourite event and she intends to compete in 2022 and works out several times a week under a newly-developed training regimen. In addition to farming, her husband was an accomplished musician who started the local high school band and was well-known for his photography, under the name George Tosh Photography. Together, they had three children, two daughters and a son. Personal Best: JT – 44.42 (1956).",

Born and baptised as Henry Pimblett, Baillie grew up in Poplar, London. Both of his parents were natives of London; his mother died when he was 16, and his father Henry Edward Pimblett, Snr. worked on the shipping docks.

In the early 1950s, he enjoyed a great rivalry with Roland Hardy. Allen was less successful at international tournaments, however, being disqualified in the 10-kilometre event at both the 1950 European Championships (after finishing second) and the opening heats of the 1952 Summer Olympics. Despite being disheartened at what he felt was the poor treatment of the British team at those Games, he continued to compete thereafter, and won several titles, including the RWA 10- and 20-mile titles three years in succession, 1949-51, and the 20-mile title in 1954 and 1958. In the AAA Championships, he was second at seven miles each year 1950-52, and third at both two and seven miles in 1949.

71959,Giovanni Evangelisti,Male,11 September 1961,179.0,70, Italy,ITA,"Giovanni Evangelisti was an Italian long jumper who began athletics in 1973. As a junior, he was undecided whether to opt for the long or the triple jump, but by 1981 he was already the national number one in the long jump. After a third place in Milano at the 1982 European Indoor Championships, and sixth in the Outdoor Championships in Athens, he exceeded 8 meters for the first time, a mark of international excellence. His best year, however, was 1984, as he had nine competitions with performances exceeding 8 meters, including the Olympic Games in Los Angeles, where he won the bronze medal (his sixth and final jump was 8.24, the same as silver medallist Gary Honey, who had a better second jump of 8.18) in an event dominated by Carl Lewis. Coached by Dino Ponchio and supported by national technician Elio Locatelli, Evangelisti then won bronze medals at the 1985 Indoor World Championships and the 1986 European Championships, indicating that he was among the best long jumpers globally. On 16 May 1987 with 8.43, in San Giovanni Valdarno, he set a national record, making him a favorite for the World Championships in Roma. It was initially believed that he had earned the bronze medal with an 8.38 metre jump, but it was eventually discovered, however, that this number had been forged by officials, and that the real distance was only 7.85. This meant that his true best jump was 8.19, which left him in fourth place behind the 8.33 of Larry Myricks, the bronze medallist. His 1988 season was also excellent, culminating in a third-place finish at the Indoor European Championships and fourth (with 8.08), at the Seoul Olympic Games. Thereafter, Evangelisti’s star began to fade. After six golden years spent at Pro Patria Milano, he moved to a club in his adopted city, Assindustria Padova, coached by Ponchio, the future manager of the women’s national team. In 1991 he earned bronze medals at the Indoor World Championships and the Mediterranean Games and seventh place at the Tokyo World Championships. By the end of his career he had earned nine Italian titles (four outdoor and five indoor) and 59 caps with the national team (1980-94).

Of Irish descent, Nelson was educated in England at Beaumont College, Windsor before attending University in Buenos Aires. Having started playing polo in 1913 he enjoyed a playing career of more than 40 years, most of them with the Hurlingham Club which he joined in 1914.He went on to win the Argentine Open with them six times between 1920 and 1937. During that time Nelson also won his Olympic gold medal, won the 1925 Roehampton Tournament with La Pampa, and won open titles in England, Belgium and, in 1922, the US Open. Nelson was not only a fine player but a great innovator and administrator within the sport of polo. He was elected President of the Argentina Polo Association for the first time in 1924, and held the post on three occasions between then and 1948. Following an idea by Nelson, the Cup of the Americas, for a match between Argentina and the USA, was launched in 1928. Nelson played in the first two contests, 1928 and 1932, but was on the losing side each time. Although Nelson continued playing well beyond his 50th birthday, he was chef d’equipe at the 1936 Olympics. He also bred some top-class polo ponies. His brother Luis was also a polo player and pony breeder while Jacks’ son John went on to become a leading player and won the 1957 Cowdray Park Gold Cup with Windsor Park. Jack senior was also a good golfer and won the amateur championships of Buenos Aires and Mar del Playa.",

95,Leslie Godfree,Male,27 April 1885,,, Great Britain,GBR,"Born in Brighton and educated at Brighton College, Leslie Godfree was the son of a solicitor’s clerk and followed in his father’s footsteps, entering the legal profession. He was a Captain with the Royal Field Artillery in World War One and was awarded the Military Cross. As a tennis player Godfree was better known as a doubles player, rarely winning singles tournaments, and in his 11 Wimbledon appearances he won just four of 14 singles matches and never progressed beyond the third round. However, he claimed a small part in Wimbledon history in 1922 when he served the first ball on the new centre court after the All England Club moved to their current Church Road home. His opponent Algy Kingscote hit the return into the net and Godfree raced forward to collect and pocket the ball to keep as a memento. It was all he got out of the match as Kingscote won in straight sets Despite his failings as a singles player. Godfree and Randolph Lycett beat the Spanish pair of Eduardo Flaquer and Manuel de Gomar in four sets to win the Wimbledon men’s doubles in 1923, He reached the mixed doubles final the following year but Godfree and Dorothy Shepherd-Barron lost to Brian Gilbert and Kitty McKane, who, less than two years later would become Leslie’s wife. Also in 1924, Godfree took part in the two doubles events at the Olympic Games with Max Woosnam and Phyllis Covell but there was to be no medal for him. Leslie forged a new doubles partnership with Kitty McKane and “Biddy”, as he called her, became his second wife in January 1926 and that summer they became the only married couple to win the mixed doubles at Wimbledon after beating the American couple Howard Kinsey and Mary Browne. As the top seeds they were expected to retain their title in 1927 but lost to the third seeds Frank Hunter and Elizabeth Ryan of the USA. Leslie played on the British Davis Cup team between 1923 and 1927 but played only in the doubles, winning six of the 11 rubbers played. He was heavily involved with the administration of the sport nationally and internationally and up to the time of his death he was a member of the All-England Club and Wimbledon Championship Committee. He was also president of the Umpire’s Association and the Veterans’ Lawn Tennis Club.",Husband of Kitty McKane

He wasted little time making his mark in the senior ranks and did the same double at the boycott-hit 1986 Commonwealth Games. Most impressively he smashed his personal best to record an upset victory over Thomas Schönlebe at the same year’s European Championships and again added a gold in the relay. A foot injury hampered him throughout the 1987 season and he failed to clinch a place in the World Championship 400 although he was part of the silver medal winning relay team. Black missed the 1988 season and most of the following year through injury but returned in 1990 to defend both his European titles and in 1991 he finished a close second to Antonio Pettigrew at the World Championships. He also ran the lead off leg when Great Britain scored a shocking upset over the USA in the 4×400 relay. His Olympic début in 1992 was a disappointment as he failed to reach the final although he did have the consolation of a bronze medal in the relay. After yet another season lost to illness and injury, he narrowly failed to retain his European title in 1994 but did win his fifth European gold by winning a third successive relay title. An otherwise excellent 1995 season yielded no medal success at the World Championship but at least he was able to stay fit and entered Olympic year in excellent shape. Black set a national record of 44.37 seconds three weeks before the 1996 Olympic Games and, although nobody could live with the astonishing performances of Michael Johnson, ran a controlled race to finish second in the Atlanta final. He won a second silver medal as the British team broke the European record in placing second in the 4x400 m. The relay team again placed second behind the USA at the 1997 World Championships in Athens but were upgraded to champions in 2009 when Antonio Pettigrew admitted to have been using EPO and human growth hormone (HGH) prior to the championships. Black retired in 1998 and followed a well-trodden path for Olympic medallists by joining the BBC athletics presentation team, and now works as a motivational speaker.

A disqualification in the opening round did not deter him and, four years later, he returned to the Games, participating in the C2 1000 once again with Lee, where the duo was eliminated in the semifinals. He also took part in the C1 1000, where he was eliminated in the opening round and the repêchage. His next stop was the World Championships, where he finished 6th in the C1 1000 in 1974 and 5th in the C1 500 in 1975. His hard work finally paid off when he was selected to represent Canada at its home Olympics in 1976 and won national acclaim by taking silver in the C1 500, Canada’s first Olympic canoeing medal since 1952. This achievement became even more notable after the nation’s failure to win any gold medals during the Games. He also competed in the C2 500, this time with Gregory Smith as his partner, and finished 7th in the final. Wood had one last hurrah by winning silver alongside Smith at the 1977 World Championships in the C2 500 and then retired from active competition, although he did win a bronze medal in sailing at the 1979 Pan American Games. His next endeavour was business and in this field he was arguably even more successful, starting off as a chartered accountant, but eventually taking on the role of stock broker.

He thus earned the name “Boy”, which stuck with him throughout his career. After making a name for himself in Australia, Charlton upset Swedish star Arne Borg early in 1924, beating him three times in Sydney, while tying one world record and breaking another. This set the two up for exciting competition at the Paris Olympics. The 1,500 m ended in victory for Charlton, improving the world record by more than a minute. In the 400 m freestyle, Charlton had to let go of Borg and Johnny Weissmuller, taking the bronze. Although an Australian hero, Charlton returned to school at Hawkesbury Agricultural College and worked his family’s land at Gunnedah, only returning to swimming in 1927. That year he defeated the Japanese Olympian Katsuo Takaishi while setting an 880 yard freestyle world record. Charlton returned for the 1928 Olympics, where he was defeated by Borg in the 1,500 m and by Alberto Zorilla in the 400 m, returning home with two silver medals. After yet another career break when he purchased property near Goulburn, Charlton made a comeback for the 1932 Games, but did not medal, at least in part due to a bout of rheumatic fever. He subsequently retired and became a sheep-raiser. He was later honored by induction into the International Swimming Hall of Fame (1972), and, posthumously, by the renaming of the Sydney Domain Baths (where he had first beaten Borg) into the Andrew (Boy) Charlton Baths.","Listed in Olympians Who Set a World Record in Long Course Swimming (800 m freestyle – 13 January 1923 - 11 April 1924 and 8 January 1927 - 27 July 1927: 11:05.2 (13 January 1923; Sydney, AUS), 10:51.8 (19 January 1924; Sydney, AUS), 10:32.0 (8 January 1927; Sydney, AUS); 1500 m freestyle – 15 July 1924 - 18 August 1926: 20:06.6 (15 July 1924; Paris, FRA))"

In 1916 Garcés was one of the founders of Club América, playing for the team until 1928 where he won multiple league titles. He did not earn enough money from just playing football so he became a dentist for the cement company Cemento Cruz Azul where he provided dental care to the staff. The cement company initially had a baseball team, but Garcés successfully lobbied to change the company’s main sport to football. The Cruz Azu football team was founded in May 1927 with Garcés named as the head coach of the side. In 1923 Mexico formed its first national football team with Garcés playing in the team’s inaugural international fixtures, against Guatemala. He played in six matches for the team that year, scoring two goals. Mexico did not play another international match until 1928 when they competed at the Amsterdam Olympics with Garcés playing in their 7–1 defeat to Spain. From 1937 to 1942 he served as the President of the Mexican Football Federation. Garcés was also a sprinter who ran in the 200 metres and 400 metres at the 1924 Paris Olympics but did not advance from his heats in either race.

66005,Tom Coulter,Male,21 April 1911,,, Canada,CAN,"A native of Winnipeg, Manitoba, Tom Coulter’s appearance at the 1932 Summer Olympics in the hurdling event was only a small part of a long and varied career. The younger brother of two-time Stanley Cup champion Art Coulter, hockey was Tom’s first calling and he achieved his first major success as a defenseman with St. John’s College in 1927, when his club took the Senior School Series Hockey Championship. After moving to Pittsburg, he attended Carnegie Mellon University and graduated with a Bachelor’s Degree in engineering 1933 and a Master’s in Economics in 1935 from the University of Chicago. In the meantime, he was very active in athletics, playing halfback for the university American football team, captaining the track team, winning the 440 m hurdles event at the 1932 Canadian Championships and running the same event in Los Angeles for the 1932 Games, where he was disqualified after knocking down four hurdles. He held records at Carnegie Mellon in the 120-yard low and high hurdles, as well as the 220-yard low hurdles and the quarter mile. Coulter also played hockey, but after nearly a decade off the ice in any major way, his goal was more so to pay for his tuition at business school than to undertake a serious career in the sport. After being signed with the Chicago Black Hawks, the same team that his brother played on at the time, Tom played one game before being demoted to the minor league Oklahoma City Warriors. After a serious leg injury and six games with another minor league team, the Cleveland Falcons, he ended his hockey career at the end of the 1934-1935 season and finished his business degree. Soon after, he began a career with Armco. For the rest of his life, Coulter developed his career in business and became a luminary in the field. He was the president of Executives Club of Chicago from 1948 through 1953, as well as heading the Sales and Marketing Executives Club of Chicago from 1948 through 1956. For 27 years, beginning in 1954, he was Chief Executive Officer of the Chicago Association of Commerce and Industry. His contributions to the development of global trade won him awards and accolades from Great Britain, Germany, Italy, France, Austria, Finland, Sweden and Japan, while his development of Chicago as an international center of commerce won him praise at home, including an Award of Merit from Carnegie Mellon, a Citation for Public Service from the University of Chicago, and the establishment of several scholarships in his honor. He died in December 2003, at a hospital that he helped establish, at the age of 92.

Having learnt his hockey in Canada he returned to England at the age of seventeen and signed for Earl’s Court Marlboroughs in the London League. Dunkelman moved to play for Haringey Greyhounds for the 1939-40 and was part of the team that became English champions for that season. After serving in World War Two he resumed his sporting career and played for a variety of London teams over the next decade and won a second national title with Haringey Racers in 1950. The 1948 Olympic Games were Dunkelman’s only tournament appearance for the national team as a rule change that occurred in 1949 robbed him of his eligibility to play for Great Britain. Outside the rink Dunkelman was a successful businessman. With the money given to him after leaving the army he set up a business producing hockey sticks. The company soon branched out into producing a full range of hockey equipment and then into footwear. Freddie Dunkelman oversaw Dunkelman and Son’s rise to eventually become a leading producer of shoe care products and only retired at the age of 87 in 2007.",

Empire were unbeaten in his two seasons with the club and in 1934 they had a memorable victory over the Hungarian national team, who were the reigning world champions and had been unbeaten for six years. However, the game ended in controversy. Empire led 2-1 going into the closing stages when Hungary had a goal disallowed, and one minute from time the Hungarian coach called his players out of the water and refused to allow them to continue the game, which was duly abandoned. Budd announced his retirement from competitive water polo shortly after this game. Jack Budd was the son of a Paddington publican, Frederick Budd, who was a top-class sprinter in his younger days.

A dental surgeon by profession, Dr. Fentiman later became a manufacturer of false teeth and presumably the success of this business enabled him to turn his attention from cycling to motorboat racing in the early part of the 20th century and in 1905, driving Javelin, he took part in the inaugural meeting of the British Motor-Boat Club on the Thames. Fentiman served on the committee of the Club in its formative years.

However he refused selection and opted instead to compete for his birth country of Wales. Phillips married and settled down in the town of Bournemouth where he became a part proprietor of a school teaching physical culture, fencing, gymnastics, and skating. In 1911 the marriage seems to have failed spectacularly and Lloyd eloped with his American mistress, Clara Hyams, to New South Wales. Hyams had lived in England since her father had been cleared of the brutal murder of an employee in Toronto some years earlier. He found success in Australia as the Physical Education director of the Brisbane YMCA before being lured to New Zealand where he performed various roles for Otago’s YMCA system. Phillips was called up to the New Zealand Army in 1918 but the war ended whilst he was still in training and he returned to his old job having negotiated a pay rise.

48302,Michelle Smith,Female,16 December 1969,160.0,71, Ireland,IRL,"By a wide margin, Michelle Smith is both the most successful Irish Olympian as well as the most controversial Irish Olympian. After fairly unremarkable appearances at the 1988 and 1992 Olympics, Michelle Smith was now coached by her husband, former Dutch discus thrower Erik de Bruin. She had made a breakthrough at the 1995 European Championships, winning two titles and three medals in all, the first ever for an Irish woman. Her sudden improvement in performance immediately caused various doping rumours, which could not be substantiated. With her husband being suspended for doping use in 1993, these rumours persisted throughout the Atlanta Games, where Smith won four medals, including titles in both medley events and the 400 m freestyle. Her title in the latter event was also controversial because the Americans had lodged a protest claiming Smith had been entered the race after the deadline, but the protest was not upheld. Smith won two more European titles in 1997, before her career came to a sudden halt in January 1998. In an out-of-competition drug test, she handed in a urine sample that had been tampered with. This was considered to be equal to a positive sample, and she was suspended for four years, effectively ending her career.","Sister-in-law of Corrie de Bruin Wife of Erik de Bruin Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the European Aquatics Championships (4–3–0 1995 Wien SWM gold: 200 m butterfly and 200 m medley, silver: 400 m medley; 1997 Sevilla SWM gold: 200 m freestyle and 400 m medley, silver: 400 m freestyle and 200 m butterfly (competed as Michelle De Bruin)) Listed in Olympic Swimmers - Doubles Champions, Same Year (1996 200/400 Individual Medley Double Champion.)"

He first entered the world of cycle racing at the age of 15, but a broken wrist and facial injuries marred his début. However, it did not deter the youngster, and it would not be long before he was seen as an excellent track and road race prospect, and his full promise was seen at the Wolverhampton Racing Club in 1941 when, shortly after his 19th birthday, he won the club 10-mile handicap by 36 seconds, off scratch. He joined the British League of Racing Cyclists (BLRC) in 1942, and the following year enjoyed 12 wins, including the National Road Race Championship. Only a puncture robbed him of a repeat victory in the National in 1944, when he came second to the Wolverhampton stalwart, Percy Stallard. Clements then enjoyed a successful 1945, when he became the first person to win the National Road Race and Time-trial Championships in the same year. He also finished second to Ted Jones in the National Hill-climb Championship. Also in 1945, Clements won the first stage, from Brighton to London, of the 483-mile stage race from Brighton to Glasgow, beating a group of French riders by half a wheel at the Putney Bridge finish. Re-instated by the NCU in 1946, Clements joined Birchfield Cycling Club, and won the National Road Race title for the third time (and later gained another second place in 1948). He was selected to represent Great Britain in the 1947 World Championships in France. As a cycle manufacturer, Clements started making his own machines in 1945, and in 1947 moved into a factory at Wellington (later Telford), Shropshire, until 1955, when it folded. By the early 1950s, Clements had become the managing director of Coventry Cycles, who were responsible for the famous Coventry-Eagle marque. After Clements became head of Falcon Cycles, Coventry-Eagle was renamed simply Falcon. He was appointed chairman and managing-director of Elswick-Hopper in 1980, the new Falcon parent company, when it was also announced that the Coventry-Eagle marque would be revived. After retiring from business, Clements started his own cycle shop “Cycles Clements” at Ledbury, Herefordshire, in 1990, and it remained in the family after Ernie’s death in 2006.",

Educated at Portsmouth Grammar School and then Emmanuel College, Cambridge, he won his football Blue in 1912 and scored the second goal in a 3-1 win. He won one England amateur cap, against Ireland, four months after the Stockholm Olympics. He also played for Dulwich Hamlet, Ilford and Casuals and had a spell with Southampton between March 1912 and January 1913 when he scored three goals in 11 Southern League appearances. He used to play in spectacles which was sometimes a handicap to him, and before an FA Cup tie for Southampton against Bury in January 1913 he had to withdraw from the starting line up due to heavy rain. Dawe served in the War when he was commissioned and served with the Forest School Training Corps before joining the Hampshire Regiment and serving in the Mesopotamia campaign and eventually reached the rank of Major before resigning his commission after nearly 12 years. Dawe never became a professional footballer due to him following his profession as a schoolteacher and he taught at several schools in the London area before being appointed headmaster at the Strand School in Brixton, and during his time there the school suffered a major tragedy when five students lost their lives in a snowstorm tragedy whilst on a trip to the Black Forest in Germany in 1936. The school was also to be at the centre of attention again several years later. Dawe became a crossword compiler for the Daily Telegraph and during the war Dawe’s crosswords attracted the attention of MI5 when an officer, while attempting one of his puzzles came across the word “Utah” which was the answer to a clue. Meaning little at the time, it transpired that Dawe’s crossword had earlier contained the words “Juno”, “Gold” and “Sword” as either a clue or answer and these were all code names for the D-Day landing but when the word “Omaha” appeared as the answer to one clue MI5 were now suspicious because this was going to be the first beach attacked during the D-Day invasion. And after the world “Overlord” and other names to be used in the attack appeared, Dawe was questioned by the security service and after a massive interrogation they eventually ruled it was just coincidence. However, the Strand school, where Dawe was still teaching, had been evacuated to Surrey during the war and it was revealed many years later that Dawe had the habit of asking students to fill in words on his crossword grids and he would then compile the clues to accompany them. The ‘coincidental’ D-Day words came from one such student, Ronald French who, it transpired, spent a lot of time at a nearby American camp and he picked up these words used by soldiers. So, it was more than a coincidence. Dawe continued compiling crosswords up to the time of his death in 1963.",

Mercer defeated all four of all his Olympic opponents inside the scheduled distance. He turned professional in early 1989 and went on a run of victories which culminated in the defeat of Francesco Damiani for the World Boxing Organization heavyweight title. After a successful title defence against his old rival Tommy Morrison, who had in the meantime starred in the fifth instalment of the “Rocky” films, he gave up the title to fight a lucrative match against 43-year-old former champion Larry Holmes. Befuddled by the tactics of his veteran opponent, Mercer lost his unbeaten record. His career then suffered a pair of setbacks, firstly he was diagnosed with Hepatitis-B and after returning to the ring he lost to the journeyman Jesse Ferguson. During the bout Ferguson alleged that Mercer offered him a bribe to lose the match but a subsequent police investigation could not prove the allegation.

Initially, he was educated at Umeå University. In 1886 he went to the United States for a year and made his way as a laborer in various trades. Back in Stockholm, he continued his studies at the Technical Night School. At the age of 21, he began to paint and was employed from 1889-94 as a decorator at the Gustavsberg porcelain company. He then studied in Paris and London. Osslund later spent several months painting northern landscapes and undertook extensive hikes in the northern wastelands. Paul Gauguin taught him to paint on waxed paper, which was cheaper and easier to handle than regular canvas while hiking. His Lapland motifs showed the magnificent wilderness and blazing fall colors. The paintings established Osslund as the “Norrland artistic discoverer.” His sister Frida Åslund (1879-1937) became a well-known author in Sweden. With regard to Osslund’s entry, the question arises again as to the sporting reference of his works. Sweden actually planned to submit its contributions “hors concours” and therefore did not really feel bound to the requirement of a sports theme. Although The rocky Lapland (Hundalen) could not be identified, there is an abundance of landscapes known in his oeuvre from this region. Hundalen is a valley in northwestern Norway east of Narvik. A Laplander from Sea Falls, originally Lapp från Sjöfallet, was a portrait of a Lapp in a kind of fur coat in mixed media on paper (80 x 52 cm).

He first came to the notice of the sporting public when he won the London AC School’s mile in 1929 and he went on to become one of the nation’s most popular sportsmen. Before the war he won the AAA mile five times (1935-39), set world records at 800m, 880y and the mile, won a silver medal in the 1934 British Empire Games 1 mile, and was European Champion at 1,500 metres in 1938. The only major disappointment came at the 1936 Olympic Games when an ankle injury preventing him from approaching his best form. Rheumatic fever kept Wooderson out of the armed forces, but he continued to run during the war year and with the resumption of international competition in 1945, he proved, in two memorable races against Arne Andersson (SWE), that he was in the best form of his life. Wooderson then moved up to longer distances and in 1946 success in the AAA 3 miles event, with a new British record, was followed by a victory in the 3 miles against France. He then took the European 5K title in the second fastest time ever. After his victory at the European Championships he retired from the track but he had one final season as a cross-country runner in 1948, winning the National, and placing 14th in the International race. In his 10 international track races for Britain, Wooderson’s only defeat was at the 1936 Olympics. His dominance of British miling was complete; when he retired, he had run the seven fastest times ever by a British miler, and he had to his credit more than 15 of the 30 fastest miles run by Britons.

He was a competitor in local cycling events in Toronto from the young age of 13, and was a student at Harbord Collegiate Institute in Toronto when he was chosen to compete at the Olympics in 1908. He won a bronze medal in the 1,980 yards team pursuit alongside Walt Andrews, Fred McCarthy, and William Morton. Anderson also entered the 5,000 metres, the 20 kilometers, and the 100 kilometers, but did not advance beyond the opening round of any of those events. Following the Olympics, Anderson later joined the Toronto Bicycle Club and competed in many local cycling races, alongside the likes of his fellow Olympic competitors, including at the Canadian Cycling Championships in 1908. He was a fierce competitor who formed legendary rivalries with his peers in local events, in particular from 1908 to 1909 with his former Olympic teammate Walt Andrews of the Royal Canadian Bicycle Club (RCBC). Anderson announced his retirement from bicycle racing in early 1910, but briefly returned later that year to face Andrews once again in August. He later took to motorcycle racing, forming another storied rivalry with fellow racer Herb Kipp, lasting until his retirement in 1911. Anderson married Harriet Grace Rankin in that same year and lived briefly in New Brunswick before moving back to Toronto, working as an automobile salesman. He died at the age of 40 of a brain tumor in 1928 at a hospital in Boston, where he went to seek treatment.",

Winkler won seven Olympic medals (five gold and both one silver and bronze), with one in the individual event, a gold in 1956. This victory became legendary: in the first round, he tore a groin muscle and had to be tied onto his mare Halla for the second round. Nevertheless, Halla made a faultless round, although Winkler screamed in pain at every obstacle, and won gold. In 1976 Winkler was the flagbearer for West Germany at the Opening Ceremony and won a silver with the show jumping team, but that followed Olympic team golds in 1956, 1960, 1964, and 1972, and he finished his Olympic career with a team silver in 1976. He later wrote several books, organized many riding tournaments, and was the team leader of the German show jumpers in 1988 and 1992. In 2006 he was inducted into the German Sports Hall of Fame. Winkler’s 1956 Olympic gold medal was his third consecutive international title as he won the first two World Championships in show jumping which were held in 1954 and 1955. For his sporting achievements he was elected German Sportsman of the Year in 1955 and 1956. At the European Championships Winkler won the gold medal in individual jumping in 1957 and added a silver in 1962 and bronzes in 1958, 1961, and 1969, all in the individual event. In all he competed 108 times internationally for Germany from his international début in 1952, retiring only in 1986. His greatest successes came on Halla (1945-1979), the only horse to ride to three Olympic gold medals, team and individual in 1956 and team in 1960.

2563,Martina Hingis,Female,30 September 1980,170.0,59, Switzerland,SUI,"Swiss tennis legend Martina Hingis was often regarded to be one of the greatest of all-time in her sport. Hingis won multiple Grand Slam titles, was ranked number one in the world in both singles and doubles, and set multiple records for the youngest player to achieve various superlatives. When she eventually retired from the sport due to injury she had earned more than $24.7 million in prize money. Hingis was born in Košice, Czechoslovakia, (now Slovakia), and played in her first tournament when she was just four. Her parents divorced when she was six, with her and her mother defecting from Czechoslovakia in 1987. They emigrated to Switzerland when Hingis was seven becoming a Swiss citizen after her mother remarried to a Swiss man. In 1993 when Hingis was 12 she won the girls’ singles title at the French Open to become the youngest player to win a Grand Slam junior title. The following year she retained her French Open title, won the girls’ singles at Wimbledon, and got to the final of the US Open. In 1996 Hingis and Helena Suková won the women’s doubles title at Wimbledon, with Hingis becoming the youngest person to win a Grand Slam title at the age of 15 years and nine months. She competed in both the singles and the doubles at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, reaching the quarter-finals in the latter. The following year she won the singles title at the Australian Open to become the youngest Grand Slam winner in the 20th century. In July 1997 she won Wimbledon, making her the youngest singles champion at the All England Club since Lottie Dod won in 1887. In 1997 Hingis also won the US Open and reached the final of the French Open. The French Open singles title would be the only Grand Slam tournament that Hingis would fail to win during her illustrious career. In all Hingis won five Grand Slam singles titles – three at Australia (1997-99), and one each at Wimbledon and the US Open, both in 1997. She was world ranked #1 for the first time on 31 March 1997, taking over from Steffi Graf, and between then and October 2001, Hingis held the #1 spot for 209 weeks. The zenith of Hingis’ career was arguably 1997-98 when she had her dominant 1997 year, and then in 1998 won all four Grand Slams in the women’s doubles, becoming only the fourth player in women’s tennis to achieve the feat. She won the Australian Open with Mirjana Lučić, and the other three Grand Slams with the late great Jana Novotná. Due to ongoing injuries in both ankles, Hingis was forced to take a temporary break from tennis in 2003 when she was 22. By that time she had won 40 singles titles and 36 doubles titles. She made a brief comeback to the sport in 2006 before a hip injury forced her to retire for a second time in November 2007. Hingis returned to tennis for a third and final time in July 2013, focusing her career as a doubles-only specialist. From 2015 to 2016 she and Leander Paes won all four Grand Slam mixed doubles tournaments. Hingis also won 27 WTA Tour doubles titles and the silver medal with Timea Bacsinszky at the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Olympics. She retired for good in October 2017 whilst ranked number one in the world in doubles.",

He served in the North Atlantic and Mediterranean and participated in the decisions to land troops at Casablanca, Sicily Salerno, and Normandy. General George S.

After three games and the defeat against Belgium, a group of players refused to return to their primitive cabins on the naval ship Hollandia, where the Dutch athletes were accommodated. Four “ringleaders” were to be sent home, including Jan de Natris, but the team threatened to go on strike for the pending game against Spain. To avoid cancellation of the bronze medal game the four players were pardoned but were not selected, which gave Von Heijden the chance for a late début for the Oranje as inside left. Von Heijden went to school in Nijmegen and played for Quick. Between 1912 and 1921 he lived in Helmond, where he initially worked for the textile company NV Raymakers, before changing to the public service, but he continued playing for Nijmegen.

920796,Seán Keating,Male,28 September 1889,,, Ireland,IRL,"Seán Keating is best known for his romantic-realistic paintings from the Anglo-Irish War and the beginning of industrialization in Ireland. He started his studies at the Limerick Technical School before he was allowed to join the Metropolitan School of Art in Dublin, where he was active teaching from 1918-54. Spending most of his life in Ireland, he was elected President of the Royal Hibernian Academy in 1949 and held this position up to 1962. He was a very conservative painter and strictly against abstract Modern Art as he feared this kind of painting would bring about a decline in artistic standards. His early works were close to socialist realism and showed his sympathy for the militant Irish independence movement. Keating’s leftist positions and a sense of social justice were reflected in his paintings. Nevertheless, he also produced religious works for the Church. The Tipperary Hurler (oil on canvas, 91 x 76 cm), painted in 1928, is Keating’s only painting of an athlete. Models were the players John-Joe Hayes from the then successful Tipperary team and Ben O’Hickey, one of his art students, who is said to have resembled Hayes. The first sketches were made in the early 1920s. O’Hickey then acted as his model for the completion. The sash identifies him as a player of the Commercials Hurling Club. The painting has been in the Hugh Lane Gallery in Dublin since 1956. A 1924 painting titled The Hunter or The Fowler from 1924 is lost. It was probably the painting submitted in Paris.",

She was undefeated in the individual medley for eight years and had it been on the Olympic program in 1932 or 1936 she would almost certainly have added an Olympic gold medal to her championship honors. She was the first American woman to win four national championships at a single meet, which she did by taking the 440y, 880y, and one mile freestyle and the individual medley at the 1937 AAU Championships. She repeated this feat in 1938. Katherine Rawls came from a dedicated swimming family in Fort Lauderdale and her sisters, Dorothy and Evelyn, both won national honors in relay events. She retired after the 1938 nationals and later, as Mrs. Thompson, became a top pilot in World War II, being one of the original 25 women who ferried planes to combat zones for air transport command. After the war, she tried in vain to qualify for the 1948 London Games. Rawls worked as a swimming teacher and eventually died of cancer.

Mahan was a star fullback on the football team at A&M, helping them to an undefeated and unscored-upon season in 1919 and captaining the team in 1920. He later became a football official in the Southwest Conference. Mahan at first ran a large farm for J. D. Leeper in Southern Oklahoma, but later worked as a vocational agricultural teacher. Mahan died in unusual circumstances. He was fishing with his family on a lake southwest of Gainesville, Texas. His wife left briefly and when she returned Mahan was missing with his cap floating on the lake’s surface. They later found his body but how he died was unclear. His fishing line was noted to be entangled in his shoelaces, leading to speculation that his line caught his shoelaces and threw him into the lake, and he was unable to recover. Mahan was also partially paralyzed for the last few years of his life, and that may have made it difficult for him to get out of the lake. Personal Best: JT – 53.53 (175-7,5) (1920).",

Ray first appeared on the international scene at the 1983 World Junior Championships, where he placed fourth in the light-middleweight division. As Canadian champion in this category, he was selected to represent Canada at the 1988 Summer Olympics, where he defeated Jorge Oscar López of Argentina, Norbert Nieroba of West Germany, and Abrar Hussain Syed of Pakistan in the first three rounds to advance to the quarter-finals, where he overcame Martin Kitel of Sweden. He lost in the semi-finals to upcoming gold medalist Park Si-Heon of South Korea and settled for bronze. Originally intending to turn professional after the Olympics, Downey remained an amateur and successfully defended his Canadian title in 1989. He then competed at the 1990 Commonwealth Games, where he captured a silver medal, losing to Richie Woodhall of England, who had won the other light-middleweight bronze medal at the 1988 Games. After being eliminated in the quarterfinals at the 1991 Pan American Games by Juan Carlos Lemus of Cuba, Downey attended the 1992 Summer Olympics but, recovering from an eye injury, he was defeated in the opening round by Hendrik Simangunsong of Indonesia (Lemus, meanwhile, went on to win the gold medal).

His other major victories were three titles at Skate America (1989-90, 1992), the 1990 Trophée Lalique, and the 1988 NHK Trophy. Bowman was a child actor, appearing in commercials and two episodes of the TV series “Little House on the Prairie.” He then used his theatrical skills in skating, becoming known as Bowman the Showman. But a wild lifestyle, and inattentiveness to his training kept Bowman from ever realizing his potential. He changed coaches frequently, or they changed on him, often quitting because they could not control his profligate habits. After his skating career ended, Bowman admitted to a cocaine habit and that he had checked into drug rehab prior to the 1988 Winter Olympics. He spent a few years in the 90s skating with the Ice Capades, and then became, of all things, a coach.

He scored both Walthamstow’s goals in the replay which United won 5-2. His performances soon attracted a lot of attention and Ted Drake signed him for Chelsea.

At the World Sprint Championships, he finished sixth, and he narrowly missed a medal at the Olympics, finishing fourth in the 1000 m, just 0.08 seconds from the gold. With the advent of the clap skate in 1997/1998, Van Velde was unable to keep up with the new equipment. After missing the Nagano Olympics, he was close to retiring when he was asked to serve as a training partner by Rintje Ritsma. This marked the start of a second career, leading to a fourth place at the World Sprint Championships in 2002. At the Olympics that same year, Van Velde again finished fourth, missing the bronze by just 0.02 seconds. Considering the 500 his best shot at a medal, Van Velde had nothing to lose in the 1000 m and went all out. He broke the World Record in the event by half a second, a time that remained unapproached for Van Velde. Having won his first international medal, Van Velde also finally made the podium in the World Sprints, finishing second in his 11th appearance, and at the World Single Distance Championships, finishing 2nd in the 1000 m. Gerard van Velde kept going for several more years, eventually retiring in 2008 with 18 Dutch titles under his belt (6 sprint, 8 500 m, 4 1000 m). Winner of 6 World Cups, finishing 2nd in the 1000 m ranking twice, Van Velde became a coach after his retirement, working for the commercial APPM team as of 2009.

He finished fifth in the National Cross-country Championships before representing England at the International Cross-Country Championship in Belgium, where he finished sixth and was the highest placed British runner. Turning to the track, he won the 3 miles in the Kinnaird Trophy meeting at Chiswick, and also the Middlesex title, before finishing second in the AAA 3 miles behind Dutchman Jef Lataster. Olney also made his International début for Great Britain against France that year. In the winter of 1947-48, he won the Thames Valley Harriers and Middlesex County cross-country titles before devoting more time to track work over the remaining winter months under the watchful eye of Sydney Wooderson, in readiness for the forthcoming Olympics. He dropped down to one mile for the 1948 Kinnaird Cup meeting and won the race on the tape, with Roger Bannister occupying fourth place in what was his first Kinnaird Cup race. Olney finished second again at the AAA, this time to another Dutchman, Wim Slijkhuis, who would take the bronze medal at the Olympics. A salesman by profession, Olney was one of the favourites to qualify for the Olympic 5000 metres final at the White City, but he disappointed by finishing seventh in his heat. The following season he won the Southern Counties Cross-Country title before finishing third in the AAA 3 miles. In 1950 Olney finished second in the National Cross-Country Championship and represented England at the International Championship, finishing seventh.

Powell again got the best of Blackburn in 1947, but retired several months later, leaving the title vacant. In 1948, Blackburn made it to the finals of the national championships, which doubled as the Olympic Trials, and won on a walkover after two other semifinalists, Larry Simons and Billy Goulding, refused to fight each other. Blackburn was declared the national champion, but the Olympic selection committee refused to name him their delegate because he had not fought anyone in the final. Over a month later, a tournament between Blackburn, Simsons, and Goulding was called to determine who would represent Canada at the Games. Goulding, by then out of shape, declined to appear, leaving the spot contested between Simsons and Blackburn, the latter of whom won the bout. In London, Blackburn defeated Mariano Vélez of the Philippines in the opening round, but then had the misfortune of being pitted against upcoming gold medalist Július Torma of Czechoslovakia and was eliminated. Blackburn began contesting the middleweight division in 1949, but was unable to regain a national title and retired from active competition shortly thereafter.",Grandfather of Mackenzie Blackburn

He had also combined for two other world records, the 4×1 mile relay (the last to be recognised for the distance) and the 4×1500 relay (which wasn’t recognised because one of the opposing runners ran a leg without the baton).

He was adopted by a relative and his name was changed to Noguchi. In 1905 Gensabulo enrolled in the Saitama Normal School and practiced tennis and kendo, achieving early success on a regional level. After graduation he was employed as a teacher but was urged to go to Tokyo Higher Normal School to specialize in physical education. Together with his senior Shizo Kanikuri he started long-distance running and took part in the national marathon trials for the Stockholm Olympics, but was not selected after placing fourth. In 1913, at the 1st National Athletics Tournament (predecessor of Japan Athletics Championships), Noguchi competed in various events and managed to win the pole vault, clearing 2.39 m. Two years later, he graduated and moved to Matsumoto. There, he started teaching, mainly kendo and judo, and promoting sports. He won the trials in the decathlon and qualified in this event for the 3rd Far Eastern Games in Tokyo, where he was victorious as well. At the Japanese Championships he won the pole vault and took second in the pentathlon and 400 metres. In 1918, Noguchi was appointed managing director of the Japan Sports Association and returned to Tokyo, becoming Tokyo High School’s physical education instructor. Noguchi qualified in the decathlon for the 1920 Olympics at Antwerpen and was selected as team captain and flagbearer of the Japanese team at the Opening Ceremony. Unlike many other competitors, he completed the contest despite cold and rain and a leg injury. After the Olympics, he finished his active career but continued to study sports in Western countries on the trip. Subsequently, he coached the Japanese team at the 5th and 6th Far Eastern Games and acted as director of the Japanese Olympic Team in Paris 1924. Noguchi became responsible for the examination of physical education teachers and wrote books about track and field. One of his students was Mikio Oda, the first Japanese Olympic gold medalist. In 1925, he was appointed professor at the Tokyo High School and fought for equivalent importance of sports compared to gymnastics. At the Amsterdam Olympics, Noguchi acted again as officer of athletics and attended the General Assembly of the International Athletics Federation (IAAF). He continued to lead the Tokyo High School Athletics Club (after 1930 Tokyo Bunri University Athletics Club). He was chairman of the history committee of the Japan Athletic Association, head coach and executive director of All Japan Athletics Federation, and Director of Dai Nippon Sports Association etc. Noguchi retired from many posts in 1941 and was appointed secretary of the Japanese Society for the Promotion of Physical Education, later general manager of the National Athletic Training Department and of the National Defense Training Department at the Dai Nippon Sports Association. After World War II, he helped rebuilding national sports organizations and the physical education system, including the first faculty of physical education. Eventually, he was appointed dean of the Tokyo University of Education’s Faculty of Physical Education and Principal of the Tokyo College of Physical Education. He retired in 1951 but returned to the university of his native Saitama and promoted sports in the region. Again, he held various positions in sports administration on a regional and national level.

921153,Jan Wils,Male,22 February 1891,,, Netherlands,NED,"Jan Wils was an architect to win an Olympic medal with a design that was realized for the same Olympics. His design for the 1928 Olympic Stadium in Amsterdam, and the surrounding buildings, was awarded with a gold medal in the 1928 architectural design competition. Thanks to good connections with IOC member Pieter Scharroo, Wils had been selected to design the stadium. It was decided to build a new stadium after the city had provided a large marshy terrain in 1925. However, Wils’ plan was not fully implemented: The organizers waived both the construction of a tennis stadium and of an Olympic Village. Built in the style of the New Objectivity, the Olympic Stadium with its closed brick façade was considered as the world’s most beautiful stadium of the time. Immediately adjacent to the stadium, two halls were constructed for indoor sports. Not far away was an unadorned swimming stadium for 6,000 spectators, which was demolished immediately after the games. One of its notable features is the Marathontoren, a 40 m high tower. Wils planned to have a fire burn in top of this tower throughout the Olympics. A traditional Greek symbol, the socialist Wils supposedly used fire to juxtapose his tower against church towers, as Dutch Christian politicians had been largely opposed to holding the (heathen) Olympics in the Netherlands. Wils remained connected to the Olympic Movement, entering the Olympic competitions in 1932 and 1948, while judging the entries and participating “hors concours” in 1936. Wils was also known for his (brief) membership of the “De Stijl” movement. This Dutch art movement and magazine existed between 1917 and 1931. Its chief proponents included by Theo van Doesburg, Piet Mondriaan and Gerrit Schröder. After a dispute, Wils left De Stijl, but remained sympathetic to the movement. The Olympic Stadium is still Wils’ best known building. It was long used as the home stadium for various Amsterdam football clubs, including Ajax for its European matches. The stadium was scheduled to be demolished in the 1990s, but was eventually declared a monument and renovated. Other notable designs by Wils include two company buildings for Citroën (built adjacent to the Olympic Stadium), and the City Theater in Amsterdam. After World War II his work remained largely unnoticed. In 1931 Wils developed plans for the Hygiea Building in Amsterdam, which was to include a weight training hall, a school pool, a large swimming pool, a rowing hall, a gym and other facilities. The facade of his design shows an attractive cubic composition. In 1929-30 he had already prepared a draft for a new building of the Academie voor Lichamelijke Opvoeding in Amsterdam, where he also taught himself. The design was characterized by alternately protruding and receding surfaces. By placing part of the building on pillars, he createda passageway to the sports fields. Both of his 1932 entries, however, were not implemented. In 1936, together with the Portuguese Carlos Ramos, he was commissioned to design a huge Stadium for Lissabon with a swimming pool. This project, which was projected in the drawing like a large ring, was also not realized. In the same year, Wils built an extension of the Amsterdam Stadium in the form of an additional uppermost ring of bleachers to increase the capacity to over 50,000 spectators. These extensions, however, which were made of reinforced concrete unlike the rest of the stadium, received an ambiguous response from the critics. The original design of his 1948 entry of a Sport and Exhibition Hall in Amsterdam dates back to 1937.",

He first experienced Wrestling in his Police training curriculum in 1938 and two years later won the first of his 21 consecutive New South Wales Amateur Heavyweight Championship in 1940. Armstrong was also amateur heavyweight champion of Australia on five occasions - 1946, 48, 50, 60 and 61. At the 1948 London Olympics, Jim won the bronze medal in the freestyle wrestling heavyweight division and two years later won the gold medal in the same division at the British Empire Games in Auckland beating future Olympic medallist Ken Richmond in the process. After a long absence from major championships he was chosen to wrestle for Australia at the Rome Olympics but was forced to withdraw following a knee injury. At the Perth 1962 British Empire and Commonwealth Games Armstrong, aged 45 years, added to his international medal by winning a bronze in the light-heavyweight division. Along with Eddie Scarf and Dick Garrard, he is one of only three Australians to win an Olympic wrestling medal.

The following season, he broke the 16-year-old World Record (held by Rudolf Harbig) in an exciting fight with Audun Boysen in front of the Norwegian’s home crowd at Bislett Stadium. Now a favourite for the gold in Melbourne, Moens had to forfeit the Olympics. A few months before the Games, he injured himself while training on a dark tennis court in Athens, and ran into a net pole. He also had to miss the next major international tournament, the 1958 European Championships, because of a dispute with his club which saw him suspended. He was still a gold medal contender in 1960, having lost no races since the Melbourne Games. However, he was upset in the final by an unknown runner from New Zealand, Peter Snell.

Things changed when they were only eight years old, however, when they discovered synchronized swimming. By the age of twelve they had joined CAMO Natation, one of Montreal’s premiere swimming clubs, and they earned their first junior national titles in 1977: Penny won the solo event, Vicky captured the figures crown, and together they were victorious in the duet. They reversed this feat in 1978: in addition to winning the duet, Vicky captured the solo event and Penny was victorious in the figures. They earned their first senior title in the duet in 1980, with taking silver (Vicky) and bronze (Penny) in the solo event, in addition to Vicky’s bronze in the figures. They defended the duet crown in 1981, as well as coming in second (Vicky) and third (Penny) in the solo event, but were defeated in the duet in 1982 by Kelly Kryczka and Sharon Hambrook. At that completion, Vicky and Penny were third and fourth respectively in the figures and the solo event. They abandoned the solo discipline in 1983 to focus on the duet and took back the title at that year’s Canadian Championships, which made them Canada’s representatives in the discipline at the 1983 Pan American Games. There they won silver behind Americans Tracie Ruiz-Conforto and Candy Costie, in addition to gold in the team event. Nonetheless, the Vilagos twins were defeated in the Olympic trials by Hambrook and Kryczka, who went on to earn silver in the duet at the 1984 Summer Games. The sisters disappeared from the public eye after retiring from active competition in the mid-1980s, but came back in a big way in 1992 when, after less than two years of training, they qualified to represent Canada at that year’s Summer Olympics. There they came in second to the American twins Karen and Sarah Josephson and were eliminated in the opening round of the solo event. After winning the silver medal, they returned to retirement the following year and Vicky took up a career in business.

He was born with the full name Julius Beresford Wiszniewski, but dropped his surname and used Beresford in his early rowing days. He legally changed his name by Deed Poll to Beresford in February 1914. Beresford won the 1901 sculling championship of the Netherlands, but it was at Henley that he enjoyed a long association. He first rowed there with the Kensington Rowing Club in 1896 and competed there every year from 1902-14, and was back again for the first post-war Regatta in 1919. His final appearance as a competitor was in 1923. In 1909 Beresford assembled a four that won the Thames Rowing Club’s first Stewards’ Challenge Cup since 1894, a trophy they re-gained two years later. Beresford won the Silver Goblets in 1911 with Arthur Cloutte when their combined ages were 83 years, but they still won in 8:15.0, a record time for the final. The following year, the Thames four won the silver medal at the Stockholm Olympics, before Beresford won his fourth Henley title in 1919 when Thames won the Fawley Cup at the Victory Regatta. After retiring from competitive rowing, Beresford became coach to the Thames crew between 1926-29, and during that time guided them to 10 trophies including two each in the Grand Challenge Cup, Stewards’ Challenge Cup, Thames Cup, Wyfold Cup, and Silver Goblets. These triumphs gave him more satisfaction than his own personal rowing successes. He continued helping young oarsmen on the Thames until very late in life and, for his 80th birthday, had a new sculling boat built for his personal use. An avid stamp collector, Beresford was the co-founder of the furniture manufacturing company Beresford and Hicks, with his brother-in-law Richard Hicks in 1891. They went on to supply furniture to the Royal Family and in 1958 obtained a Royal Warrant when Julius’ son Jack had joined the company. Jack went on to become one of Britain’s greatest rowers, and Jack’s brother Eric was also a winner at Henley between 1927-31. To maintain the long family tradition, Jack’s nephew Michael Beresford was also an Olympian. In the days when both Julius and Jack were both racing, and because newspapers of the day only used initials instead of first names, Julius was referred to as J. Beresford, Sr, while Jack was known as J. Beresford, Jr., purely for identification purposes.",Father of Jack Beresford Grandfather of Michael Beresford

Hillman was one of three triple winners in track & field at the 1904 Olympics and his winning time of 53.0 in the 400m hurdles shattered the existing world record. However, he knocked over the eighth hurdle, which, in 1904, invalidated any record claim and, more importantly the barriers were only 2-6 in height instead of the regulation 3 feet. After 1904, Harry Hillman competed at both the 1906 and 1908 Olympics, but with less success. At London in 1908, he concentrated on the 400m hurdles and, after setting a world record of 56.4 in the heats, improved to a career best of 55.3 in the final but still placed second to Charley Bacon.

Armour studied in St. Andrew’s and Edinburgh, but after a stay in Morocco he moved to London where he had a studio together with his colleague Phil May. After some years in London he moved to Wheathampstead, Hertfordshire, where he ran a farmhouse together with his then best friend, Joseph Crawhall.

From 1928 Mycielski continued his musical education at the École Normale de Musique in Paris, where he became president of the Association of Young Polish Musicians in Paris in 1934. He returned to Poland in 1936 and began to compose, publish in music magazines, and work as a music critic. During World War II, he was taken prisoner-of-war and forced to work on a German farm. After returning to Poland, Mycielski became co-editor of the magazine “Ruch Muzyczny” (“Musical Movement”) and in 1960 its editor-in-chief. In 1948 he briefly served as chairman of the Polish Composers’ Association. In 1955 he wrote an article in “Przegląd Kulturalny” (“Cultural Review”) criticizing the isolation of Polish music. After further publications critical of the government, Mycielski was censored and removed from his position as editor-in-chief of “Ruch Muzyczny”. In 1978 he co-founded the illegal Society for Academic Education. Nevertheless, in 1983 he became an honorary member of the Polish Union of Composers. Mycielski received numerous awards, especially in the 1950s, including the Commander’s Cross of the Order of Polonia Restituta and the Order de mérite culturel in Monaco. His extensive archive is located in Warszawa. His style is described as neo-classicism. Mycielski composed symphonies and other orchestral works, ballets, chamber music and songs. For his less than 10-minute long Uwertura śląska (Silesian Overture) for orchestra and two pianos, written in 1948, he received the prize of the Minister of Culture and Art in 1955.

95816,John Nicks,Male,22 April 1929,,, Great Britain,GBR,"With two parents who were well-known Sussex track athletes, it was little surprise that John Nicks, and his younger sister Jennifer, would both follow a successful sporting career. Their sporting links were further re-enforced by the fact that they were the great-great nephew and niece of 19th century cricketer John Wisden, founder of the famous Wisden Cricket Almanac. One of John’s forenames is that of his famous ancestor. It was soon after the ice rink opened near their Brighton home, where their parents ran a sports shop called “Wisdens”, that the siblings took to the ice, and both showed individual skills, with John winning the British junior title in 1947 (having been runner-up the previous year), and Jennifer finishing third in the girls’ event. It was as a pair, however, that they gained their greatest success and, under the guidance of Gladys Hogg at the Queen’s Ice Club in London, they won six consecutive British Pairs titles 1948-53, during which time John also served two years National Service (1948-50) with, firstly, the Royal Sussex Regiment and then the Royal Middlesex Regiment. They competed in their first major international event at the 1947 European Championships, finishing sixth, and the following year made their début at the World Championships.

At their peak in the late sixties and early seventies they were amongst the most popular figures in British sport and twice finished in the top three in the polling for Britain’s sports person of the year. Coakes was following in the footsteps of her two brothers who had competed at international level when, in 1960, the thirteen year old was partnered with a ten year old Irish pony called Stroller. Despite being freakishly small by the standards of world level show jumping the pony propelled Coakes up the ranks of the sport. Five years after the pair started competing at junior level Coakes onboard Stroller won the 1965 Women’s World Championship at Hickstead in England. 1967 proved a memorable year highlighted by a win in the British Show Jumping Derby and their consistency in top level events assured they would arrive at the 1968 Olympic Games as one of the medal favourites. The Games began well for Coakes and Stroller were only denied the Olympic individual title by American Bill Steinkraus. Stroller, suffering badly from an infected tooth, put in two disastrous rounds of jumping in the team competition which cost the British team any chance of a medal. In 1970 she was runner-up at the Women’s World Championship and became the first women to win the Großer Preis von Hamburg but by then Stroller was reaching the end of his career. After Stroller retired at the end of 1971 Marion continued to achieve some successes and won the Queen Elizabeth II Cup in 1975 but never again reached the heights that the pair achieved together.

98716,Walther von Mumm,Male,13 January 1887,,, Germany,GER,"A member of the family that founded the Mumm champagne business, Walther von Mumm was known as a horseman, a pioneer aviator and especially as a balloonist. Before the First World War he regularly took part in long distance balloon races all over North America including major races at St. Louis and Kansas City. The second son of Baron von Mumm, Walther was given control of the H.G. Mumm Extra Dry Company and with clever advertising turned the brand into a major name, notably in the American market. When his brother, Henri, unexpectedly died he took over as head of the entire Mumm Company and inherited the estimated $20,000,000 family fortune. In 1912 he became engaged to Frances Scoville, an American heiress, but before this had been made public he travelled from St. Moritz to Paris to break this news to his former mistress, Marie von Rensimer. A former waitress from Philadelphia, von Rensimer was considered one of the world’s great beauties and had a string of wealthy lovers and admirers. This meeting ended disastrously for von Mumm, the precise details of incident were hushed up but what is clear is that Walther ended with two bullets in his left lung after Marie had pulled a gun on him. Although the von Mumm family had resided in France for over a hundred years, Walther had himself been born in Germany and on the outbreak of World War I was considered an enemy subject. Instead of internment in France for the period of the war he chose to return to Germany. Walther refused to fight on the Western Front out of a loyalty to his French upbringing and instead served against the Russians on the Eastern front. He was wounded, again in the lung, by Russian gunfire. The years immediately after the war were disastrous; the French government claimed the entire Mumm business empire as part of the reparation process against Germany, he was estranged from his wife, who later died following an appendectomy, and was involved in a lengthy custody battle over his daughter. His remaining business interests in Germany, still valued in millions of dollars, were lost after the collapse of the reichsmark and German hyper-inflation. He still had the rights to the Mumm brand in the United States but the introduction of prohibition meant this was rendered worthless overnight. With what remained of his fortune he invested in Wall Street and again amassed a substantial fortune before the Wall Street crash of 1929 left him penniless. Von Mumm took a job in a brokerage firm and rented a $10 dollar a month room in a New York boarding house whilst concealing his financial plight from his friends. In October 1931, whilst staying at a friend’s house, he attempted suicide. Leaving a note with the words, “Bury me as I am and keep this out of the newspapers”, he attempted to shoot himself in the heart, but he missed and for a fourth time suffered a bullet wound to the same lung. Although the initial prognosis was poor, he rallied and eventually made a recovery. The Winter Olympics were held four months later in Lake Placid and the German bobsleigh team suffered a number of serious crashes which left them very short of personnel. Walther von Mumm had some previous bobsleigh experience in St. Moritz and remarkably was called to drive the Germany II bob with a completely inexperienced team, they finished in seventh place.",

920645,Ludwig Hohlwein,Male,26 July 1874,,, Germany,GER,"Ludwig Hohlwein was largely self-taught as a poster artist, graphic designer, architect, and painter. His poster designs were used for stamps both in the Third Reich (1937 Antiaircraft Defense, 1942 German gallop derby The Blue Ribbon) and later in the Federal Republic of Germany (1978 75 Years German Museum München). Animals, hunting, landscapes, and technology dominated his posters. In the commercial sector, Hohlwein designed the logo of the Bavarian Franziskaner wheat beer brewery, which is still in use today. Self-employed since 1903, he designed, amongst others, furnishings for hotels, department stores, and passenger ships under the influence of the Arts and Crafts movement. Before World War I, he was appointed professor. At the same time, he increasingly specialized in illustrations and posters. Initially inspired by Art Nouveau, he later developed his own style from the New Objectivity. Hohlwein became one of the most important advertising poster artists and an icon of advertising art in West Germany. Early in 1933 he joined the Nazi party NSDAP and was involved in shaping the visual appearance of the Third Reich. Hitler put him on the Gottbegnadeten (God-gifted) list of the most important commercial artists. As a result, after World War II, was prohibited from working for almost one year. Hohlwein took part in the Art Competitions in 1932 at Los Angeles and 1936 at Berlin, and designed the official poster for the 1936 Winter Olympics. Two posters titled Winter in Germany are dated in the early 1930s. Accordingly, it is not certain which one was shown in Los Angeles. Stay young / Playing golf in Germany from 1930 was published by the German Tourist Information Office in New York. It may be identical to the Female Golfer of 1936. It is unknown what kind of Race was advertised with the poster of this title. Hohlwein designed posters for both horse races and motorsport events. In 1936, he used the motif submitted as Hoppegarten also for a poster for the track in München-Riem. The Wiesen Horse Race at Oktoberfest was originally the centerpiece of the event. However, it did not take place after 1913 and was held again for the first time in 1934, the year of the entered poster.",

6049,Ivan Dvorny,Male,5 January 1952,207.0,105, Soviet Union,URS,"Born in a small village near Omsk, Ivan Dvorny did track and field athletics (mostly shot put) in his youth and did not take up basketball until 1966, when he moved to Omsk to study in high school. Dvorny started professional basketball with Uralmash Sverdlovsk in 1969 and from 1971-73 played with Spartak Leningrad. With Spartak, Dvorny won the silvers at the Soviet championships in 1972 and 1973 and the FIBA European Cup Winner’s Cup in 1973. Dvorny was selected to the Soviet national team in 1970, after playing on the winning European Junior Champions. The high point of his career was at the 1972 Olympics, where the Soviet team beat the Americans in a highly controversial final, by 51-50, and won a gold medal. The next year the Soviet team, as the reigning Olympic champions, had a two-month tour of America, but after returning from America, Dvorny was arrested and charged with smuggling and received a three-year prison sentence. Apparently Dvorny had bought a pair of jeans and a shirt in America, had not declared them in customs and had attempted to sell them in Sverdlovsk, but there were also wide-spread rumors that it was actually a mock-trial, as a KGB attempt to tone down the popularity of the Soviet basketball team, who had become national heroes after winning the Olympic gold. After serving his sentence, Dvorny returned to basketball, but at less than his previous level. From 1976-78 he played with Spartak Vladivostok and from 1978-80 was with Dynamo Moskva, but with little success. Dvorny retired from basketball in 1980, at only 28-years-old. Because of his criminal record, Dvorny had difficulty finding a job, so from 1980-94 he worked as a fitter at the locomotive depot Moskovka in Omsk and from 1994-2000 worked as a maintenance man at the Omsk fire department. In 2001 Dvorny emigrated to the United States, where he settled in Baltimore, Maryland, and worked at a local supermarket for nearly 10 years before returning to Russia. From 2012 until his death from lung cancer, Dvorny was president of the Omsk Region Basketball Federation. Since 2009 an annual basketball tournament in his honor has been held in Omsk.",

82331,Barbara Ann Scott,Female,9 May 1928,,, Canada,CAN,"Barbara Ann Scott is the greatest female singles skater produced by Canada. She passed all her skating tests by age 10, the youngest Canadian to ever do so. In 1939, aged only 11, she became Canadian junior singles champion. She repeated that title in 1940 and attempted to win the senior championship in 1941 and 1942, but was runner-up both years to Mary Rose Thacker. These titles came despite her father’s death in 1941, which left her family with little money for training. Scott won her first of five straight Canadian senior championships in 1944. In 1945 and 1947 Scott was North American champion. International competition resumed in 1947 and Scott entered both the World and European Championships – in that era, the Europeans were not restricted to natives of Europe. Thus, in 1947, within six weeks, she held the concurrent titles of Canada, North America, Europe, and the World. Her triumphs in 1947 brought her fame at home and a huge welcome was arranged with Ottawa’s children given half a day off from school so they could watch the adulatory parade. The citizens of Ottawa also pitched in to present her with a new yellow convertible automobile. But future IOC President Avery Brundage protested this gift, and demanded that Scott return the car or risk losing her amateur status. Barbara Ann Scott returned the car and was allowed to compete at the 1948 Olympic Winter Games. She dominated the competition at St. Moritz and easily won the Olympic gold medal, defeating Austria’s Ewa Pawlik, who took the silver medal. After the 1948 Olympics, Scott turned professional, where she was a huge success. She skated with the Ice Capades, starred in a London theatrical ice show based on the musical Rose Marie, and finished her career while starring in the Hollywood Ice Revue. Scott retired from skating in 1955 to marry American publicist and businessman, Thomas V. King, whom she had met while travelling with the ice shows. They settled in Chicago, where Scott began a second sporting career of training and showing horses. Much lauded in her native country, Scott helped carry the Olympic torch on its journey to the 1988 and 2010 Winter Olympics, both held in Canada. In the latter edition she was also selected as one of the Olympic flagbearers alongside a host of other Canadian luminaries. In addition to being a three-time Lou Marsh Trophy winner as Canada’s best athlete (1945, 1947, 1948), she was made an Officer of the Order of Canada in 1991, a member of Canada’s Walk of Fame in 1998, and has been inducted into Canadian Olympic, Canada’s Sports, Ottawa Sports, Skate Canada, and International Women’s Sports Hall of Fames.
