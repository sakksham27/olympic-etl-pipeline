They rose into prominence in 1986, when they won their first gold at the World Championships. They would later win three more golds at the World Championships (1987, 1989, 1990) and one silver in 1988. At the European Championships, Gordeyeva and Grinkov won golds in 1988, 1990 and 1994 and a silver in 1986. They also won gold at the 1988 Winter Olympics, their only Soviet title coming in 1987. Gordeyeva and Grinkov turned professional in 1990 and in April 1991 they married, with a daughter born in 1992. As professionals, Gordeyeva and Grinkov won the World Professional Championships in 1991, 1992 and 1994 and toured with Stars on Ice. But when a new ISU rule allowed professional skaters to regain their Olympic eligibility, the pair returned to amateur competition for the 1993-94 season and skated at the Olympics, winning their second gold. In 1994 they won their only Russian title. After their second Olympics, the pair again turned professional and toured with Stars on Ice. In the summer of 1995, Gordeyeva and Grinkov were inducted into the World Figure Skating Hall of Fame and planned to return to Stars on Ice for their fourth season. But on 20 November 1995, while the pair was rehearsing for opening night of the upcoming tour, Grinkov collapsed on the ice and died at age 28 from a massive heart attack. Doctors later discovered that Grinkov had a congenital heart condition which caused his death. In February 1996, Gordeyeva returned to the ice, this time as a solo performer and skated with Stars on Ice until 2000, when she took some time off to give a birth to a second daughter. A year later, Gordeyeva married Ilya Kulik, the father of her second daughter and the 1998 Winter Olympic singles gold medalist. Gordeyeva skated professionally until 2007. She later worked as a skating coach and choreographer in the United States, and published two books, My Sergei: A Love Story (1996), which in 1998 was made into a movie “My Sergei,” starring Yelena Berezhnaya and Anton Sikharulidze as Gordeyeva and Grinkov, and A Letter for Daria (1998).",Wife of Sergey Grinkov Wife (divorced) of Ilya Kulik Wife of David Pelletier Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the European Figure Skating Championships (3–1–0 1986 København silver: pairs (competed for the Soviet Union); 1988 Praha gold: pairs (competed for the Soviet Union); 1990 Leningrad gold: pairs (competed for the Soviet Union); 1994 København gold: pairs (competed for Russia)) Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the World Figure Skating Championships (4–1–0 1986 Genève gold: pairs (competed for the Soviet Union); 1987 Cincinnati gold: pairs (competed for the Soviet Union); 1988 Budapest silver: pairs (competed for the Soviet Union); 1989 Paris gold: pairs (competed for the Soviet Union); 1990 Halifax gold: pairs (competed for the Soviet Union))

Later in the 1929 season, he showed dramatic improvement and after some solid performances with the Oxford & Cambridge team in America, he was a member of the team which improved the British 4×880 yards relay record by five seconds in the international match against Germany. On leaving Oxford, Hampson took up a teaching post at St. Alban’s School and in 1930 he first revealed himself as a medal prospect for the 1932 Olympic Games. Victories in the AAA Championships, the international match against France and at the British Empire Games, where he beat a class field by 20 yards in 1:52.6 seconds, established him as one of the world’s leading half-milers. In 1931, two international victories and a second AAA title consolidated his position and in 1932, his third successive win the AAA 880 yards was followed, later in the afternoon, by a second place in the 440 yards. Clearly, Hampson had added the essential of quality of speed to his carefully acquired stamina and was now ready for the Olympics. In Los Angeles, Tom Hampson qualified comfortably for the final, where he wisely declined to follow the suicidal pace of the Canadian Phil Edwards, who led at the half-way mark at 52.3 seconds with Hampson trailing by some 20 metres. Edwards inevitably faded and Hampson then had to contend with another Canadian, Alex Wilson, but he won the battle down the home straight and took the gold medal with a new world record of 1:49.7 seconds. Later in the Games, Hampson won a silver medal in the 4×400 metres relay and then closed his track career as a member of the 4×880 yards relay team in the British Empire versus USA match in San Francisco. In 1935, Tom Hampson gave up his teaching post and became an Education Officer in the RAF.

On the international scene he was a member of the team when they played in two finals: Inter-Cities Fairs Cup against Leeds United in 1968 and Cup Winners’ Cup against Dynamo Kyiv in 1975. He was still a member of the team in the 1975-1976 season, but by then he played fewer and fewer games. He moved then to Csepel, where he played two more seasons in the first league. He finished his football career at Bp. Építök. Between 1972 and 1975 he played 6 times in the Hungarian national team and scored 2 goals. Additionally, he was capped 30 times in the youth national team (1964–1967), ten-time in the Olympic team (1970–1972). He was a member of the team that won a silver medal at the Munich Olympics. In 1979, at just 30, he said goodbye to professional football. In the end, he never became a coach, primarily because he would have had less time with his family. He graduated as an economist and worked in his profession. In 1981 he was elected the Honorary Champion of Ferencváros.",

He attended the local College School, and after finishing his education moved to London, and it was there that he took up competitive swimming, and was coached by national champion Rob Derbyshire at the Lime Grove Baths. In 1913, Beaman was a member of the team that won the coveted Whiteley Mile race on the River Thames. He later joined the Shepherd’s Bush water polo team until the outbreak of World War I when Beaman, a keen cyclist, joined the 25th County of London Cyclists’ Battalion. After initial duties at home, he was posted to India when he was twice the winner of the British Army’s 110 yards swimming title in Calcutta. Beaman left the Army in 1919 and returned to Cheshire, where he joined the Chester Swimming Club and remained a member of the club up to the time of his death. He was the one-time 50-yard champion of Chester and won the prestigious local 11⁄2 mile event on the River Dee three years in succession - 1920, 1921, and 1923 (there was no race in 1922). It was at water polo that he excelled, however, and in 1922 he helped Cheshire win the English County Water Polo Championship. That same year Beaman finished second in the Northern Counties’ Mile Championship at Southport.

In 1944, part of his pre-war work was destroyed in a bombing raid. After World War II, Frank first lived in Birkenfeld in the Hunsrück mountains. During this time he created numerous drawings and watercolors, but was reluctant to give them away. He became a member of the Palatinate Secession and the New Darmstadt Secession, as well as the German Artists’ Association. Frank became known exhibiting throughout Germany and in South America. Since 1968, he lived again in the Saarland. Among his motifs were often erotic depictions, oriented on classicist motifs. In addition to mythological and Arcadian topics, his work includes mainly landscapes, especially from the Mediterranean region. In the 1960s, these landscapes became increasingly abstract. Frank’s legacy is in the state archive in Saarbrücken. In 1952 in Helsinki, he exhibited Sports Field, Seven Nudes of Men from 1949, a watercolor in the format 48 x 62.5 cm.

His career was placed in jeopardy when he received a shrapnel wound in his leg serving as a machine gunner in World War I, and doctors told him that he could never compete again. Nevertheless he continued to train and, in 1923, he placed joint-second at the United States national speed skating championship. The following year he represented Canada at the 1924 Winter Olympics in the 500, 1000, 5000 m and allround events, but never placed higher than seventh. It was nevertheless a successful year for him, however, as he won the United States national and world championships within the span of two weeks. He lost these titles in 1925, but regained the latter the following year by defeating five-time Olympic champion Clas Thunberg. He participated in the 1928 Winter Olympics, in the 500, 1500, and 5000 m events, but again failed to place higher than seventh and retired from active competition later that year, still holding seven world records and numerous North American ones as well. He then owned and operated gas stations in Saint John, New Brunswick prior to his death in 1940, at the age of 42, from a skin disease. His funeral procession was attended by thousands, but he was buried under a simple footstone with the name ‘Charlie’ written on it. He was inducted into the Canadian Sports Hall of Fame in 1955 and the New Brunswick Sports Hall of Fame in 1970. The city erected a stone in the 1960s and named the Charlie Gorman Arena in his honor, but it was not until 2010 that funds were raised for a proper memorial and gravestone for the local and international legend.

His career was interrupted by World War I and, after fighting in both the World War I and the Estonian Independence War, Neuland took up weightlifting again in late 1918, winning the Estonian lightweight title in 1921 and 1924 and the middleweight title in 1923. He also won gold at the 1923 Baltic Championships and set six world records in the lightweight and middleweight classes from 1920-25: three each in the snatch and clean & jerk.

He soon took up boxing and, by the age of 15, found it difficult to be matched with competitors of his age due to his large size and considerable talent in the ring. By 1983 he was the world amateur junior champion and, shortly thereafter, the Canadian super heavyweight title holder, the first of five consecutive ones that he would earn in the 1980s. He made the national Olympic team in 1984, but lost by decision in the quarter finals of the super heavyweight division to eventual gold medalist Tyrell Biggs. Four years later and after winning a silver medal in the 1987 Pan American Games, in the same category, he took home the gold medal and quickly announced his decision to turn professional, switching allegiances to his native Britain. Lewis slowly rose through the professional ranks, earning title after title, until his defeat of Donovan Ruddock established him as one of the world’s premier heavyweights. He was declared World Boxing Council heavyweight champion in 1992 after Riddick Bowe abandoned the title, and defended it three times until he lost a bout to American Oliver McCall. He regained the belt from McCall in 1997 and held it until his surprise defeat at the hands of Hasim Rahman in 2001. Lewis regained the title from Rahman later that year and held it until his 2004 retirement from boxing. He was inducted into Canada’s Sports Hall of Fame in 2008 and the International Boxing Hall of Fame in 2009, made a Member of the Order of Canada in 1988, and invested as a Member of the British Empire in 1999, which was upgraded to Commander in 2002.","Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the Summer Pan American Games (0–1–0 1987 Indianapolis BOX silver: super-heavyweight +91 kg) Listed in Olympic Boxers Who Won a Professional World Championship (Olympics - 1984 / 1988 Super-heavyweight (Gold); Professional World Champion - WBC Heavyweight (1992-1994); WBC Heavyweight (1997-1999); IBF, WBA & WBC Heavyweight (1999-2000); IBF & WBC Heavyweight (2000-2001); IBF & WBC Heavyweight (2001-2002); WBC Heavyweight (2002-2004).)

After performing in public, he was declared a professional by the Italian federation, and he broke his shoulder during one of these exhibitions. Also, his 4-year-old son died, leaving Braglia with a nervous breakdown. But he managed to regain his amateur status, and prepared himself for the 1912 Olympics. There, he retained his all-around title, while also leading the Italian team to victory. He then ended his career - in which he had remarkably only won one World Championship medal (bronze in the 1909 team competition). In 1932, he returned to gymnastics, as the trainer of the Italian team at the Los Angeles Olympics. To support himself, Braglia worked as an acrobat, and he performed in many circuses. Although his performances left him moderately wealthy, Braglia spent the money on a bar and a farm back in Modena, and died in poverty, of thrombosis, in 1954. In honor of his sporting achievements, he was awarded a Gold Medal by the Italian Olympic Committee.",Listed in Olympians Who Received the Italian Olympic Association (CONI) Gold Medal ()

The suite was composed in 1935 and had its world premiere later that year in Copenhagen. The work consisted of four movements, of which the first three reflect the Moravian landscape and folklore, and only final movement is actually devoted to sports. The programmatic titles of the movements were Greeting, Pastorale, Folk Song and Ski Final. The autograph of the score for symphony orchestra is kept in the Museum of Czech Music in Praha. Křička also submitted the march Vám, letci, vám… (You, flyer, you…). It has been noted that the record of the march was broken when it arrived at Berlin. Czechoslovakian sources state that he already competed in Los Angeles in 1932 with Pochod Skautů (Scouts’ march), written for a Scout Jamboree in 1930. He is, however, not listed in the Official Report. Křička was a close friend of 1932 silver medalist Josef Suk, and Křička’s brother Petr was an avid skier who came up with the idea to compete in the art competitions. Petr also wrote the text for Suk’s medal winning composition. Křička studied in Praha and Berlin. From 1919-45 he was professor at the Praha Conservatory, which he headed from 1942. In addition to operas, he composed film and theater music, symphonies, chamber music, choirs and children’s songs. In his early works a Russian influence was evident, as Křička lived in Russia from 1907-10. His works encompass all musical styles and genres of songs.

In 1963 Antson began training under Olympic Champion Boris Shilkov, and soon established himself as one of the top skaters in the world. The 1964 season was probably Antson’s best season. At first he won his first Soviet distance title at 5,000 m, was second at 10,000 m and finished in fifth position in the all-around. Next he made his international début at the 1964 European All-around Championships, where he won the all-around title while finishing first in the 1,500 and second in the 500. At the 1964 Olympics, Antson won the only gold medal for Soviet male speed skaters, in the 1,500, and was fifth in the 10K. After the Olympics, Antson set his only World Record, clocking 4:27.3 over 3,000 m at Oslo. At the 1964 World All-around Championships Antson won bronze in the 1,500 m and 5,000 m, but lost the all-around title due to a fall in the 500, settling for a disappointing 15th place. After the 1964 season, Antson was named the best speed skater of the season and was awarded the Oscar Mathisen Trophy. In 1965 Antson won a silver in the all-around at the Soviet Championships and a bronze at the 1,500 m at the European All-around Championships. In 1966 he was third in the all-around at the Soviet Championships and in 1967 won his only Soviet all-around title. In 1967 he also won a Soviet title in the 1,500 and a silver (1,500) and bronze (3,000) at the European Championships, while finishing in fourth position in the all-around at both the European and World All-around Championships. Those would remain his last medals at international championships. In 1968, Antson again won silver in the all-around at the Soviet Championships and won his second Soviet title in the 1,500. Antson retired from sports after the 1968 Olympics, and began work as a sports official, first in the Soviet Estonian Committee for Physical Culture and Sports, and later with the Estonian Olympic Committee. In 1992 at Albertville, Ants Antson was selected to be the first Estonian flag bearer after the country became independent of the Soviet Union.

99720,Maëlle Ricker,Female,2 December 1978,169.0,63, Canada,CAN,"Prior to making her Olympic début at the 1998 Olympic Winter Games in Nagano, Maëlle Ricker (pronounced MY-ell) was the 1997 FIS Canadian and ISF World Junior half-pipe champion and 1996 bronze medalist. She competed at the 1997 FIS World Championships in Italy, finishing fourth in the snowboard cross and 11th in the half-pipe, and was 13th in the half-pipe at the ISF World Championships. Ricker finished her first Olympics in fifth in the halfpipe at Nagano, then won her first World Cup gold in a snowboard cross event later that year. In her prime, Ricker missed the 2002 Olympic Winter Games in Salt Lake City with a knee injury. In her third Olympic Winter Games in 2006, Ricker finished 23rd in the half-pipe, and then in the snowboard cross final (a serious medal contender after recording the fastest qualifying time), she crashed so hard she was flown off the mountain and hospitalized with a concussion and torn neck muscles, not even remembering she had finished fourth. She recalled those results as: “seeing the love of your life on the subway but never getting to meet them.” Doubts were raised if Ricker would ever be the same again after her concussion, but her will to succeed pushed her to continue competing even after her sixth, seventh and eighth knee operations. Ricker arrived at the Vancouver 2010 Olympic Winter Games as the overall leader in the 2009–10 FIS Snowboard World Cup, having skipped the Winter X Games to focus on Vancouver 2010. She easily won her snowboard cross quarter-final and then the semi-final when American Lindsey Jacobellis was disqualified for missing a gate. In the Olympic snowboard cross final, Ricker held on to the lead that her great start gave her and won the Olympic title to become the first Canadian woman to win an Olympic gold medal on home soil – just minutes from her actual home in North Vancouver. Ricker’s success continued after her 2010 Olympic title finishing second in the World Cup snowboard cross standings. At the 2011 World Championships, she crashed out of the snowboard cross final against long-time nemesis Jacobellis, finishing fourth. Ricker had a few snowboard podium finishes in the 2011-12 World Cup and then captured another gold on home soil at the 2013 World Championships in Québec, Canada – the only major title that had alluded her as a senior. Nineteen days before the 2014 Sochi Olympic Winter Games snowboard start, Ricker fractured her left forearm during a training session in Aspen, Colorado and had to undergo surgery, arriving in Sochi with 16 screws and two plates in her arm and still in a cast. She amazingly finished fourth in qualifying, but would go on to crash in her first heat, well before the medal rounds, leaving her in 21st, ending her Olympic snowboarding career. A four-time Olympian in a pair of disciplines, Ricker retired in 2015 from a competitive snowboarding career that spanned more than two decades, as an Olympic champion, World champion, two-time Winter X Games champion and twice winning Crystal Globes as the overall World Cup snowboard cross champion. Ricker was introduced to the sport by her brother Jorli who was also a member of the national snowboard team. Nicknamed “Mighty-mouse”, Ricker graduated from Sentinel Secondary School in West Vancouver, British Columbia. Her father was a geologist and her mother was a biology teacher at Capilano College.",Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the World Snowboard Championships (1–0–1 2005 Whistler bronze: snowboard cross; 2013 Stoneham-et-Tewkesbury gold: snowboard cross)

Guest and Wright teamed up for the double sculls and were selected to represent Canada at the 1928 Amsterdam Olympics, where they were defeated by the American duo of Charley McIlvaine and Paul Costello in the final and took home a silver medal.

He designed posters and billboards for the state elections of Saxony in 1930 for the Economy Party and the German People’s Party and the international hygiene exhibition in Dresden in 1931. During the Third Reich Petzold produced posters for festivals on behalf of the Nazi Party (NSDAP). During the devastating bombing of Dresden by the Allied on 14 February 1945, Petzold lost his atelier and all his properties. Nevertheless, he remained loyal to the city. Even after World War II, he was – as before – known for designing posters for political and commercial events, as well as for the reconstruction of Dresden. The Official Report of 1936 wrote about the tender for the official poster and Petzold’s design: “The threefold task: to show the importance of the Olympic Games in a meaningful way, at the same time to point out Berlin as the host city and to advertise the Games in an emphatic way that could be understood by the whole world, had not been solved. However, since according to the regulations of the Reichskulturkammer (Reich Chamber of Culture) the prizes offered for competition must be distributed, and the five best of the entered works were awarded prizes. The first prize was awarded to the Dresden graphic artist Willy Petzold, whose design - an antique bronze head with the winner’s head-band - did not meet the requirements for the official Olympic advertising poster, but seemed suitable as an advertising poster for the Olympic Art Exhibition and was later used for this purpose”. The N.S.-Air Show in Dresden 1933 of his second entry took place on the Großenhain air base near Dresden. The poster appeared in a photo from the art exhibition.",

In 1927 he went to Paris for further training, made friendships with the best artists of the city and won the 1932 Rome Prize of the Prussian Ministry of Culture, so that he could work a few years at the Villa Massimo. In 1934 he again worked in Germany. Germany’s best known sports administrator Carl Diem introduced Breker to the 22-year-old decathlete Gustav Stührk, who became Breker’s favorite model. The sculpture “Decathlete” with which he earned the silver medal at the 1936 Olympic Games, today still stands in the Berlin Olympic Stadium in front of the entrance to the dome room. Reichs Chancellor Adolf Hitler was excited by Breker, who was first “decadent” for the Nazis, and gave him highly paid public jobs since 1935 and appointed him professor in 1937. Breker became the sculptor who best represented the Aryan people and shaped the new German monumental style. For the Nazis he was the best German sculptor of their age, and was given a large studio room in Berlin. After World War II Breker was de-Nazified despite his commitment as a supporter of the Nazi regime. He settled in Düsseldorf, and although he could no longer gain public orders, he had many private commissions from industrialists and politicians. He also created sculptures of major German sports people, such as Jürgen Hingsen, Ulrike Nasse-Meyfarth and Walter Kusch.",

The Canadian then fought Tate in a battle that most spectators, including Tate’s coach, believed that O’Sullivan won. Nonetheless, the judges awarded the match to Tate, who was booed by his hometown audience during the medal ceremony.

18246,Dick Hyland,Male,6 July 1900,,, United States,USA,"Dick Hyland was a legendary figure whose life was bigger than the legend. He was a star in rugby football, playing from 1916-25, including at the 1924 Paris Olympics. Hyland went to those Games shortly after enrolling at Stanford but stayed in France and coached the Stade Français rugby squad, until his father told him to return to the States and get back to school. At Stanford Hyland starred on the football, baseball, and track teams, playing halfback on the football team, where he was nicknamed “Tricky Dick” because of his open field running. In 1926 against Cal, on the first play from scrimmage, he raced 48 yards for a touchdown, which triggered Stanford to a 41-6 upset victory. He played in both the 1927 and 1928 Rose Bowl Games, and was elected to the Stanford Hall of Fame in 1961. Newspaper reports also had him running 100 yards in 9.9 on the track team. After graduating Stanford, Hyland entered the movie business, serving as the technical director for the movie “The Drop Kick,” one of the first John Wayne movies. On that set he met the actress Adela Nora Rogers St. Johns, who would briefly become his first wife. Their son, Richard Rogers St. John later became President and CEO of film-making subsidiary of Guinness. Hyland joined The Los Angeles Tribune in September 1928 as a sportswriter but had an itinerant life, despite writing a column for them for many years. In 1932 he started what became a well-known radio program in Los Angeles. He lived in Honolulu in the 1930s, where he met his second wife, Lou Lansburgh, another young starlet. He would repeat that pattern with wives three and four, with none of his marriages lasting more than a few years. Hyland had to leave the Hawaiian Islands somewhat urgently after being exposed for allegedly spying on Filipino workers on Maui for the Hawaiian Sugar Planters’ Association. Hyland joined the US Marines in 1942 and served as a captain in World War II with the 2nd Marine Aircraft Wing, which contributed to major operations at Wake Island, Guadalcanal, Midway, Saipan, Tinian, Guam, and Okinawa. After the war, Hyland had some problems with alcoholism.",

He spent the next season on loan to Parma AC (Serie B) where he played 17 games, scoring the only two goals of his entire national and international career, and at the end of the season AC Milan called him back to be Baresi’s replacement.

At Carlisle, which he attended from 1902-1907, Mount Pleasant was a jumper on the track team, and he also played quarterback on the football team alongside Jim Thorpe. Mount Pleasant never competed in the AAU championships in track & field, but in 1908 he entered the long jump at the Eastern Olympic Trials in Philadelphia. There he jumped 23-2¼ to finish second, only ¼ inch behind Cornell’s Edward Cook. This performance was enough to place Mount Pleasant on the 1908 US Olympic team. At London, Frank Mount Pleasant competed in both the long jump and triple jump, and finished sixth in both events. In the long jump, won by Frank Irons of the United States, he failed to equal his performance at the Trials, jumping 22-4½ and trailing four Americans and the Canadian, Calvin Bricker. In the triple jump, he set a personal best with 45-10 but was over three feet behind Ireland’s Tim Ahearne, who won with 48-11¼.

All three brothers would play ice hockey and all three won the German Championship with their local Berliner SC team. All three would also play for Germany. But in 1933, with the political situation darkening as Adolf Hitler and the Nazi party rose to power, all three Ball brothers left, taking up offers to play in Italy and Switzerland and avoiding the growing persecution of Jews in their home country. Rudi Ball was the best pre-war ice hockey player in Germany, but is best remembered for his 1936 Olympic appearance. He was the only Jewish player in the German Olympic team, and was initially not even selected. Because another star player, Gustave Jaenecke refused to play if his friend Ball was not on the team, the Germans recanted, and Ball was allowed to compete. Ball could not match his 1932 performance, when Germany won the bronze in the four-team tournament at Lake Placid. As the third-placed European team in Garmisch, Ball did win a European Championship bronze, having won the title in 1930. He played on eight German championship teams between 1928 and 1944 and won the prestigious Spengler Cup in Davos three times. In 1948, he emigrated to South Africa, joining his brothers Heinz and Gerhard, both former ice hockey players. There he continued to play, even winning the South African Championships in 1951. In his later years, Ball was described as charming and impeccably dressed, while displaying occasional glimpses of the dark “Berlin humour” which had sustained him in tougher times.

John did not follow his father’s footsteps in to wrestling ring, choosing sailing as his preferred sport instead, and after winning the Merlin Rocket Championship three years in succession between 1956-58 he went on to become one of Britain’s most successful dinghy racers in the 1960s and 70s and enjoyed a memorable three month spell in 1967 when, with David Hunt, the 1972 Olympic Tempest Class silver medallist, he retained both his British and European Flying Dutchman titles before going to Montréal to win the world title.

In 1949 he won his first senior title, the Welsh mile championship and the following year he competed in a major international championship for the first time and reached the final of the European Championships in his more favoured 3000 m steeplechase. Disley made a breakthrough into the higher echelons of the steeplechase in 1952 by setting a world best time for the 2000 m steeplechase in winning the AAA Championships – a performance which helped him to qualify for the British team at the Olympics Games. He won his heat in Helsinki, becoming the first Briton to break nine minute for the 3000m steeplechase, and then took a further eight seconds off his best time as he won the bronze medal behind Horace Ashenfelter and Vladimir Kazantsev. Disley was unlucky that the British Empire and Commonwealth Games did not include a steeplechase during his time as an athlete so instead he contested the mile at the 1954 edition finishing fifth in his heat and failing to reach the final. Earlier the same year he had produced an undistinguished performance at the European Championships. Despite the lack of championships in 1955, he performed well enough to be voted Welsh Sportsman of the Year after setting a British record in a GB-USSR match in Moscow in a time which would have been a world record if set a month earlier. He arrived at the Melbourne Olympics as top-ranked Briton and with a good shot at another medal but a bout of Pneumonia caught whilst mountaineering in Snowdonia hampered his preparation and instead it was team-mate Chris Brasher who won a surprise gold medal with Disley trailing in sixth place. He retired after competing in the 1958 British Empire and Commonwealth Games in Cardiff. In all he broke the British steeplechase record 5 times during his career and was AAA champion in 1952,1953 and 1957 A member of the London Athletics Club, he first worked as a psychical education teacher in Isleworth, Greater London before taking up an appointment as chief instructor at the National Mountain Sports Centre at Plas y Brenin in Wales. He also served as a vice-president of the UK Sports Council during the seventies. Disley was an accomplished climber and served as a pioneer of the sport of orienteering in the UK. He published books on all three of his sporting interests. Disley was appointed a CBE in 1979 for his work in outdoor education and was inducted into the Welsh Sports Hall of Fame in 2007. After being inspired by the New York Marathon he and Chris Brasher decided to start a race modelled on the event in London.

902735,Clermont Pépin,Male,15 May 1926,,, Canada,CAN,"Clermont Pépin was a Canadian composer, pianist and music educator. He studied with influential Canadian composers Claude Champagne in Montréal (1939-41 and 1944-46) and Arnold Walter in Toronto (from 1946), and at the Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia from 1941-44. In 1949 he won the Prix d’Europe as a pianist and lived in Paris until 1955, where he took piano and composition lessons with Arthur Honegger, André Jolivet, and Olivier Messiaen. In 1955-73 and 1977-87 Pépin taught at the “Conservatoire de musique du Québec à Montréal”, but in the interim he worked for the Ministry of Culture in Canada. From 1967-73 he acted as director of the Conservatoire. He was elected vice-president (1969-1972) and president (1980-82) of the CAPAC (Composers, Authors and Publishers Association of Canada). He even founded his own publishing house to publish his own works. Pépin was appointed Officer of the Order of Canada in 1981 und of the National Order of Québec in 1990. He was married to pianist Raymonde Gagnon and later to violinist Mildred Goodman. The earliest work written by the 12-year old Pépin was staged in 1938, one year later a symphonic adaptation of a piano score. His first symphony – still in his early post-Romantic style – was broadcast in 1947. In 1948, he took part in the orchestra section of the art competitions with his Concerto No. 1 for piano and orchestra written in 1946 and first performed in the same year by the Montréal Youth Symphony Orchestra. Elements of jazz and serial music were noticeable in his ballets and theatre music from the 1950s. In 1972 Pépin wrote Monade III, a bravura piece for violin and orchestra for the Montréal International Music Competition. In 1983, at the 50th anniversary of the Montréal Symphony Orchestra, they performed his symphony Implosion. In later years, he also composed religious works.",

A unique part of this achievement was that none of the championships were won in the same category as he moved from bantamweight all the way up to light-welterweight during his amateur career. He only lost three of his 140 amateur bouts but it was a major disappointment for him that the third and final loss of his career came in his opening fight at the 1952 Olympic Games. Van Rensburg made a successful transition to the world of professional boxing and in January 1954, less than a year after his debut, he became South African lightweight champion. The next year he divested Joe Lucy of the British Empire lightweight title, made three successful defences of the championship and appeared to be the verge of a world title fight when a poor run of form would proved costly to his career. He lost his titles to compatriot Willie Toweel and suffered a pair of defeats to journeymen fighters over 1956-57 but then rebounded in the welterweight division by again winning South African and British Empire championships. As the decade ended he travelled overseas and fought regularly in both Australia and Europe compiling a record of 32 wins, 13 defeats and 3 draws in his 48 fight career until his retirement in 1960. By career he was a Traffic and Licence Inspector.",Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the British Empire/Commonwealth Games (1–0–0 1950 Auckland BOX gold: bantamweight -54 kg)

He had five matches and won all of them by pins, needing only 16 minutes, 48 seconds, to complete them. At the 1980 Olympics, where Balboshin was the Soviet flagbearer at the Opening Ceremony, he was also heavily favored to win the heavyweight gold, but had to withdrew from competition after two rounds, when he seriously injured his shoulder in a match against Vasile Andrei. It took more than two years for Balboshin to recover from that injury and, after returning to sports in 1983, he won his fifth Soviet title in 1984 and was chosen for the Soviet 1984 Olympic team. The Soviet boycott put an end to his hopes of competing at a third Olympics, however, and Balboshin retired. Balboshin was considered the world’s best Greco-Roman heavyweight wrestler during the 1970s and rarely lost a match. In addition to his Olympic gold, Balboshin was World Champion in 1973-74 and 1977-79 and European Champion in 1973, 1975-79. He also won silver at the 1974 European Championships and was fourth at the 1975 Worlds. He won five Soviet titles (1973, 1977, 1980, 1983-84).

She gained attention the following year by coming in second in the event at the 1979 Pan American Games, behind Evelyn Ashford of the United States, and taking bronze in the 100 metres. Canada’s boycott of the 1980 Summer Olympics deprived her of a chance to participate in that tournament, but she returned strongly to the Commonwealth Games in 1982 by winning four medals: gold in the 100 m and 4x400 metre relay (alongside Charmaine Crooks, Molly Killingbeck, and Jill Richardson-Briscoe), silver in the 4x100 metre relay (with Killingbeck, Angela Bailey, and Marita Payne Wiggins), and bronze in the 200 m. After coming in seventh in the 100 m at the 1983 World Championships, she was finally afforded an opportunity to attend the Olympics in 1984, where she finished eighth in the 100 m and captured silver in the 4x100 m relay (alongside Bailey, Payne, and France Gareau). For her achievements in the world of track and field, Taylor was made a member of the order of Canada in 1985 and became known as Angella Issajenko. Her change in name, and the birth of her first child, did not affect her prowess in the athletic realm and she earned three medals at the 1986 Commonwealth Games: gold in the 200 m, silver in the 4x100 m relay (with Bailey, Esmie Lawrence, and Angela Phipps), and bronze in the 100 m.

45298,David Theile,Male,17 January 1938,,, Australia,AUS,"Born to a family of medical doctors, David Theile learned to swim at the age of five, and became one of the world’s best backstrokers by the later 1950s. Theile won his first Australian title in the 110 yd backstroke in 1955, defending that title in 1956 and also won the Australian Olympic trials with a world record of 1:02.9 to establish himself as a favorite for 100 backstroke gold at the 1956 Olympics. His closest rival at the Olympics was teammate John Monckton. Theile had a unique turn which seemed to help him gain time on his opponents but was of questionable legality. He had been given an unofficial warning by the judges for using this turn in the heats and decided to use a more orthodox method in the semis. In the final Thiele reverted to his original technique, using it to good effect to defeat Monckton by a second to win the Olympic title in a world record 1:02.2. After the Olympics, Theile continued competing, but after being disqualified from the Queensland state championships in 1957 due to his turn technique, he retired from sports to concentrate on his medical studies at the University of Queensland, but made a brief comeback in 1960 to defend his Olympic title. Although Theile had won his third Australian title in 1960, at Rome, he was considered a longshot for gold, the 100 back favorite role going to world record holder Monckton, but in the Olympic final, Monckton misjudged the turn and broke a finger as he smashed into the wall, and Theile won gold comfortably ahead of two Americans Frank McKinney and Bob Bennett. A day after his backstroke victory, Theile led the Australian medley relay team to a silver medal. Theile retired from sports for good after his second Olympics and graduated from the University of Queensland with a medical degree in 1962. After post-graduate training as a Surgical Registrar at the Royal Brisbane and Women’s Hospital, Theile was awarded a fellowship of the Royal Australasian College of Surgeons in 1967. After obtaining further experience in the United Kingdom, Theile entered private practice as a general surgeon in Brisbane in 1974, and was appointed to the visiting staff of the Princess Alexandra Hospital.

He continued wrestling in the United States, becoming AAU Greco-Roman lightweight champion in 1929 and AAU freestyle lightweight champion in 1930-31. Käpp retired from sports after the 1931 season but, a month before the 1932 Olympics, when it was clear that Estonia could not afford to send an Olympic team to America, Käpp was approached by Estonian sports officials, who offered him and other Estonian athletes living in America a spot on an Olympic Team. At first Käpp refused, like many other athletes, because he had not practiced in nearly a year, but later decided to participate at the Olympics along with track & field athlete Alfred Maasik. At Los Angeles, however, in a very light competition, Käpp was clearly out of form, being eliminated in round three of Greco-Roman welterweight and in round two of freestyle lightweight.

In the following years, Gärderud concentrated on the steeplechase, and was favored at the 1972 München Olympics, but was unfortunately suffering from a severe cold, and was eliminated in his heat. Gärderud was also eliminated in the heats of the 5,000 m at the 1972 Olympics, but only seven days later, set a steeplechase world record of 8:20.8.

The culmination of Gärderud’s career was at the 1976 Montréal Olympics, where, after a stirring contest with Malinowski, Gärderud won gold in a world record time of 8:08.02.

In 1946 she switched to Denmark’s Christian Gymnasiastbevægelse (DKG) where she was coached by the renowned gymnastics teacher Ingeborg Paul Petersen and swam with fellow Danish medallists Karen Margrethe Harup and Fritze Carstensen. Simultaneously, she started her education as a gymnastics and swimming teacher at DKG. In 1947, Andersen participated in her first European Championships in Monaco, winning bronze in the 100 m freestyle and gold in the 4×100 free relay. At the London Olympics, Andersen won gold in the 100 freestyle and a silver in the 4×100 relay. She was also the favorite to win the 400 free, but fainted suddenly and almost drowned because of stomach cramps in the heats, before being towed ashore by fellow competitors Nancy Lees and Elemér Szathmáry. In her autobiography Andersen attributed this incident to dysmenorrhea. In 1949 Andersen set a world record of 58.2 in the 100 yard freestyle, which stood until 1956. At the 1950 European Championships in Vienna, she won another bronze in the 100 freestyle and silver in the 4×100 free relay. In her career Andersen won nine individual Danish championships, several team championships, and four individual Scandinavian titles. In the mid-1950s she emigrated to the United States, where she settled in Long Beach, California, and later obtained US citizenship. She then began a new career as a professional straits swimmer. She was the first person to swim a major channel both ways (Santa Catalina, California). With her six trips across the English Channel during the period 1957-65, she set the record for the most Channel Swims by a woman, and even won open competitions in Channel Swimming while competing against men. In 1958 she set the record English Channel time for women at 10:59 hrs. Her world records extended from 100 y (1949) to 50 miles (Chicago to Kenosha, Wisconsin in 1962).

She first represented Switzerland at the Olympic Games in 1992, where she was 25th in the 15 km, 31st in the 30 km, and 9th in the 4x5 km relay. She missed the 1994 edition, but attended the 1997 World Championships, where she was 42nd in the 15 km freestyle and 59th in the 5 km classic. She returned to the Olympics in 1998 and, in the relay, seemed to have clinched the bronze medal alongside Brigitte Albrecht-Loretan, Sylvia Honegger, and Andrea Huber. An amazing final leg by Italy’s Stefania Belmondo, however, secured that nation the final podium spot by a margin of just under two seconds. Leonardi’s next stop was the 1999 World Championships, where she was 27th in the 30 km classic and 28th in the 15 km freestyle. Her next major international championship was the 2002 Winter Olympics and, by then competing as Natascia Leonardi Cortesi, won a bronze medal in the relay with Albrecht (then Albrecht-Loretan), Huber, and Laurence Rochat. Leonardi Cortesi then had a best result of 23rd in the 30 km freestyle, in addition to a 10th-place finish in the relay, at the 2003 World Championships, and was 16th in the 10 km freestyle, 23rd in the 30 km classic, and 11th in the relay at the 2005 edition.

97958,Joe Sullivan,Male,8 January 1901,,, Canada,CAN,"Joseph “Joe” Sullivan’s careers in life were as varied as they were successful. He first tasted success as goaltender of the University of Toronto’s junior ice hockey squad in 1919, when the team took the Memorial Cup, awarded annually to the men’s amateur junior championship team. The following season, he was both captain of the junior team and a member of the senior one, winning the intercollegiate tournament with the latter. He played with the team for five more seasons, captaining once in 1924-1925, and winning four more intercollegiate championships, all while working towards a degree in medicine. He also played golf at the University of Toronto, winning intercollegiate titles in 1923 and 1924, the latter as captain of the school’s golf club. In 1926 he joined the Toronto Graduates and won the Allan Cup, the annual trophy for the amateur senior men’s championship ice hockey team, and earned the chance to represent Canada at the 1928 Winter Olympics. He also threatened to boycott the team unless his older brother Frank was allowed to join the team, against coach Conn Smythe’s wishes. During the two games where he minded the net, his teammates scored a total of 24 goals, but his opponents could not manage a single one. It was no surprise that Canada took that gold at that year’s ice hockey tournament. After the Olympics, Sullivan’s interests shifted from hockey and he began to practice medicine, specializing in otolaryngology, which focuses on the ear, nose and throat. During World War II, he served as a captain in the Royal Canadian Air Force and, afterwards, moved into academics as an associate professor at the University of Toronto, and eventually served on the university’s Board of Governors. He continued his practice as a physician even when appointed to the Canadian Senate by Canadian Prime Minister John Diefenbaker, a patient of his, and he served in that capacity until his retirement in 1986. He died two years later in 1988, the same year that he was made a member of the University of Toronto Sports Hall of Fame. During his lifetime, he was made a Knight of the Order of the Holy Sepulchre and a Knight Commander of Order of St. Gregory the Great with distinction under the Roman Catholic Church. As a final honor, the Senator Joseph A.

He coached Charlton at three Olympics, 1924, 1928 and 1932, and also saw him break countless records. Hay also groomed many other leading Australian swimmers, including the Olympians Garrick Agnew, Rex Aubrey, Warren Boyd, Bill Kendall, and Noel Ryan, Because it was against the Olympic code at the time to employ a professional coach, Hay was officially called a massage therapist. The Australian team managers, however, paid him for his coaching. He was not only a well-known swimming coach and administrator but also in surfing. Hay died from a heart attack one month before leaving for the Helsinki Olympics in 1952.",

Charles first started work in an architectural firm at age 15, while a student in architectural studies at the Pennsylvania Museum and School of Industrial Art. Perhaps his crowning achievement was the development of the master plan and building design for the University of Colorado at Boulder, which has been described as Italianate classical, also referred to as Rural Italian Renaissance architecture, and partially based on building designs Toscano and Firenze villages. Klauder was the collegiate gothic architect who transformed many American campuses from disparate collections of stylish buildings into memorable places with distinct identities. He is known for creating background buildings on many American college campuses. During his career, Klauder won numerous awards and served as president of the Philadelphia chapter of the American Institute of Architects. He was the author, with Herbert C. Wise, of College Architecture in America. Both, his 1928 and 1932 works submitted for the art competitions were projects of the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia. In 1928, these were listed as seven different ones, four showing the stadium (named Franklin Field) and one each the interiors of the Palestra, the (Hutchinson) Gymnasium and its 75 foot (23 m) indoor pool. All these were built between 1922 and 1928. The engineer involved in the construction of the stadium was Gavin Hadden, who competed in 1932. In 1932, Klauder again submitted five individual projects under the collective heading ”University of Pennsylvania”: 1) two views of the stadium, 2) the Palestra, 3) the Recreation Building, 4) a sports hall, called Rec Hall, of the Pennsylvania State College (now Pennsylvania State University) from 1929, and 5) the gymnasium of the Hill School in Pottstown, Pennsylvania, designed in 1931.",

47443,David Wilkie,Male,8 March 1954,182.0,76, Great Britain,GBR,"David Wilkie, Britain’s most successful international swimmer since the heyday of Henry Taylor some 70 years earlier, first learned to swim in Sri Lanka, where he was born of Scots parents. He returned to Scotland in 1965 to attend Daniel Stewart’s College in Edinburgh and although he had no serious competitive aspirations he joined Warrender Baths SC, where he was fortunate to meet an understanding coach in Frank Thomas. On a modest training schedule, Wilkie won a bronze medal in the 100 metre breaststroke at the 1970 Commonwealth Games and a silver medal in the 200 metres at the 1972 Olympics. It was these performances which inspired him to raise his sights. In January 1973 he went to the University of Miami to study marine biology and he then had the time, the facilities and the self-motivation to establish him at the best breastbone swimmer in the world. By the summer of 1973 he had, in part, fulfilled his ambition by winning the 200 metre breaststroke at the World Championships with a new world record. His subsequent record at major championships remains unmatched by any other British swimmer. In 1974 he won the 200 metres breaststroke and the 200 metres individual medley at both the Commonwealth Games and the European Championships and his winning time in the individual medley at the latter event was a new world record. These outstanding performances earned him an MBE in the Queens’ Birthday Honors list. At the 1975 World Championships he won both individual breastbone events and took a bronze medal in the medley relay. Wilkie opened the 1976 Olympic season by becoming the first Britain ever to win an American Championship title. In fact, he won three – the 100 and 200 metres breaststroke and the 200 metres individual medley. Then at the Montréal Olympics, his greatest ambition was fulfilled.

56910,Yevgeny Minayev,Male,21 May 1933,156.0,60, Soviet Union,URS,"Not much is known about Yevgeny Minayev outside the sports arena. Minayev took up weightlifting while serving in the Soviet Army. His strength was first discovered by his commander, a weightlifting enthusiast, who introduced Minayev to weightlifting technique and signed him up for his first competition, the 1956 Soviet Championship. At that meet, Minayev surprised everyone by breaking his first world record, 114 kgs in the press, but he finished in fourth position overall at those championships. Minayev quickly rose to become the top Soviet featherweight weightlifter and was selected for the 1956 Soviet Olympic team. At those Olympics, Minayev won silver behind American Ike Berger, but improved to gold four years later in Rome, beating Berger. Besides his Olympic success, Minayev won golds at the 1957 and 1962 World Championships, while earning silvers in 1958 and 1961, again behind Berger. Minayev was also European Champion in 1958, 1960 and 1962, winning a silver in 1961. Domestically, Minayev won the Soviet title seven times (1957-59, 1961, 1963, 1965-66). During his career, Minayev set 13 featherweight world records, nine in the press, one in the snatch, and three in the total. Although Minayev was the top Soviet featherweight weightlifter for a decade, he missed a lot of international tournaments where he would have been the main favorite to the gold due to disagreements with Soviet sports officials. He refused to train under any coach and regularly missed the Soviet team’s training gatherings. In 1966 Minayev retired from sports, after he had not been sent to an international tournament in four years by Soviet sports officials, despite being nearly undefeated in Soviet Union. Minayev then worked as a weightlifting coach for a short while, but was not very successful. Minayev also started drinking and worked as a mechanic, before doing temporary farm jobs around his hometown Klin. In the last years of his life, Minayev was homeless, living on the streets of his hometown, Klin. He starved and froze to death on the streets in early December 1993, at 60-years-old.",

In Köln, he was not only involved in the construction of the Müngersdorfer Stadium, but also on the buildings of the Köln Fair, the University and the Mülheim Bridge. The Müngersdorfer Stadium was designed by Abel for the 1928 Olympic Games. The construction was initiated by the then Lord Mayor of Köln, Konrad Adenauer, from 1921-26, who was later German Chancellor, and was created and upgraded in 1928 making it at the time the largest sports facility in Western Europe. The facility consisted of a stadium for 60,000 spectators, an out-of-stadium point (ASV Stadium), swimming pool, hockey rink, velodrome, tennis courts and other sports venues. Events previously held there included the 1926 German Fighting Games, and the 1928 German Gymnastics Festival. This complex was a reason to bid to host the 1936 Olympic Games, but this was not successful. In 1975, a new stadium was built on the same site, which was eventually replaced in 2001 by a pure soccer stadium (officially now the “RheinEnergieSTADION”) for the 2006 World Cup.",

Tretyak played his entire career, 1969-84, with one club – CSKA Moskva, winning 13 Soviet titles (1970-73, 1975, 1977-84), a record he shares with Viktor Kuzkin. He also won fourteen European Champions Cup titles (1969-74, 1976, 1978-84), which is also a record. Tretyak was selected as the MVP of the Soviet Championships five times (1974-76, 1981, 1983). Internationally Tretyak starred for the Soviet Union during the legendary 1972 Summit Series against the NHL All-Stars, after first playing internationally for the USSR in 1970, and he led the Soviets to Olympic gold in 1972 and 1976. In 1980, Tretyak was pulled from the nets after the first period of their Olympic match with the United States, and the USA went on to defeat the Soviets in that game and win a gold medal. Tretyak himself stated afterwards that substituting Vladimir Myshkin for him cost the Soviets a seventh consecutive Olympic gold, insinuating that he would not have let in the goals that Myshkin allowed, but he would eventually win his third Olympic gold in 1984. Tretyak won 10 World Championships titles (1970, 1971, 1973-75, 1978-83) and eight European Championships titles (1970, 1973-75, 1979-83), and was named as the best goaltender at the 1974, 1979, 1981 and 1983 World Championships. Tretyak also took part in the 1974 Summit Series, won the 1979 Challenge Cup between the Soviet Union and NHL All-Stars, and won a gold at the 1981 Canada Cup and bronze at the 1976 Canada Cup. In 1983 Tretyak was drafted by the Montréal Canadiens but he was never allowed to play, as the Soviet authorities blocked the move. This was also the primary reason why Tretyak retired from hockey in 1984 at the age of 32. After his retirement Tretyak worked as an official with CSKA Moskva until he was hired by the Chicago Black Hawks as a goalie coach in 1990, which has allowed him to coach some of the top goalies of the past 15 years, such as Ed Belfour, Dominik Hašek, Jocelyn Thibault, and Martin Brodeur. From 1998-2002 Tretyak also worked as a coach with the Russian national team. In 2000 he worked as a special advisor to the Russian president on sports questions and in 2003 he was selected to the Russian State Duma. He is currently the chairman of the State Duma Committee of Physical Culture, Sport, and Youth. In 2006 Tretyak was selected as the president of the Russian Ice Hockey Federation. He was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1989, the first Soviet player to be so honored and the first to be inducted without having played a game in the NHL. In 1997 he was also inducted into the IIHF Hall of Fame.","Torchbearer within the Olympic Stadium at the Opening Ceremony of the 2014 Winter Olympics (Lit flame) Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the European Ice Hockey Championships (10–1–2 1970 Stockholm gold; 1971 Bern and Genève gold; 1972 Praha silver; 1973 Moskva gold; 1974 Helsinki gold; 1975 München and Düsseldorf gold; 1976 Katowice bronze; 1977 Wien bronze; 1978 Praha gold; 1979 Moskva gold; 1981 Göteborg and Stockholm gold; 1982 Helsinki and Tampere gold; 1983 Düsseldorf, Dortmund, and München gold) Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the World Ice Hockey Championships (10–2–1 1970 Stockholm gold; 1971 Bern and Genève gold; 1972 Praha silver; 1973 Moskva gold; 1974 Helsinki gold; 1975 München and Düsseldorf gold; 1976 Katowice silver; 1977 Wien bronze; 1978 Praha gold; 1979 Moskva gold; 1981 Göteborg and Stockholm gold; 1982 Helsinki and Tampere gold; 1983 Düsseldorf, Dortmund and München gold)"

Coached by Dino Nai, a university veterinary lecturer, and representing Pro Patria Milano, he made his debut at the Amsterdam Games but was only fourth in his 1500 m heat. Although he combined athletics with work, he managed to train twice a day, emulating professional training schedules. “Why do they go so fast today, compared to us 40 years ago?” he told Gazzetta dello Sport in 1974. “Because they train more, or rather, it’s the only thing they do. We also had to work. I had already understood then how things were and I trained more than the others, even secretly. Taking advantage of my job situation (I was a council surveyor, responsible for road maintenance, so I was on the road, unsupervised), I would go to the track and allow myself a few kilometres. Then in the afternoon, at the Giuriati track, I would work on speed.” The high point of his career was the Los Angeles Games, coming from behind (last 300 m in 41.7) to take the gold in the 1500 m. A year later, he equalled the World Record winning at the Universiad in Turin in 3:49.2. Just a few days later, on 17 September 1933, he became the sole record holder bettering the record at the Milan Arena to 3:49.0, which remained an Italian record for 23 years. In Berlin 1936 he did not manage to repeat his Los Angeles victory; he was outrun after 500 m and settled into third place behind Jack Lovelock and Glenn Cunningham. He moved to the United States and finished his running career in 1941, then became a wine trader. During his career, Beccali also won a gold (1934) and a bronze (1938) in the 1500 m at the European Championships, as well as 10 Italian titles (eight in the 1500 m, one in the 800 m, one in the 5000 m).

In 1934 Konarska married the Polish poet and writer Antoni Słonimski, another member of the group, while Janina gradually withdrew from artistic activity. After eight years in exile in Paris and London during World War II, she returned to Poland concentrating on book illustrations. Both of her works for the art competitions were color woodcuts.

Later in the season he won the Yonkers Marathon then, by finishing second in the 1908 Boston race, Hayes won a spot on the Olympic team. After his Olympic victory, Hayes paid a brief visit to his grandparents in Ireland and then returned to New York where Bloomingdale’s had plastered their department store with photographs of Hayes and announced that their employee, who had been rumored to train on the store track on the roof, had been promoted to manager of sporting goods. Years later, Hayes laid to rest this oft-repeated bit of Olympic lore. He never did actually work at Bloomingdale’s, or train on the roof. He drew a salary from Bloomingdale’s but most of his time was spent training at a track outside Manhattan. Hayes turned pro upon his return to America and four times met, and lost to, Dorando Pietri in professional marathon races. In 1912, Hayes coached the U.S. Olympic marathoners and later was cross-country coach at Columbia.

After that, it came as a surprise that in 1932 he wanted to take part in the Los Angeles Olympics in the road race. He was so determined to compete that he wanted to ride from Budapest to Hamburg and by taking a job on a boat across the ocean, he would have saved more from the cost of travel. Unfortunately, this adventure could not be realized. In 1933, Győrffy finished third in the 100 km national championship. In 1936, he competed at the Berlin Olympics as a track racer in the sprint competition. During his career, Győrffy often clashed with the leadership of the Hungarian Cycling Association, so he was banned several times. In 1930, he was banned for a year for spreading malicious news. In 1935, during the Tour de Hongrie race, he threw his bottle at the presidential car and smashed its window. For this, Győrffy was at first banned permanently, a penalty that was reduced to two years in light of his results from the past. In 1936, he was banned forever for his actions against one of his competitors. He wanted to return in 1939 and appealed, but the association did not rescind his suspension, so he retired.

Zenga helped Inter win Serie A in 1988/89, the Italian Super Cup in 1989, and the UEFA Cup in 1991 and 1994. Having played one game at the 1984 Olympics, Zenga went on to keep 41 clean sheet in 58 appearances for the senior national team between 1987-92. He played in the 1986 and 1990 FIFA World Cups, winning a bronze medal in the second of those years, when he also set a world record of going 518 minutes without conceding a goal, a record still standing more than 28 years later. Zenga also played at Euro ‘88. Zenga left Inter Milan in 1994, and then had spells at Sampdoria and Padova, before ending his career in the USA with New England Revolution. After retiring as a player, Zenga turned to management, firstly as player-manager of the Revolution, and was then much-travelled, taking charge of clubs in Italy, Turkey, Romania, Serbia, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates and England. Having chalked up over 500 matches as a player, he added nearly 500 more to that total thanks to his managerial career in eight countries across three continents.

After a year at the University of British Columbia, he entered the University of Southern California in 1930 and undertook proper athletic training while earning a degree in geology (having switched from his initial interest in medicine). His efforts paid off and he was selected to represent Canada at the 1932 Summer Olympics, where he found himself in a four-way tie for first place with Corny Johnson, Simeon Toribio, and McNaughton’s friend at USC Bob Van Osdel in the high jump. In the tie-breaking round, none of the competitors were able to clear 2.00 or 1.99 metres but, unlike the others, McNaughton was able to repeat his 1.97 metre performance and thus took the gold medal. After tying for first place in the high jump at the 1933 NCAA Men’s Outdoor Track and Field Championship, he graduated from USC and retired from active competition. He earned a masters’ degree from the California Institute of Technology in 1935 and a Ph.D. from USC. Between these two degrees he served with the Royal Canadian Air Force during World War II, receiving the Distinguished Flying Cross and Bar. After several years as a visiting professor at USC, he began working as a geology consultant in the petroleum industry.

After defending his title in 1932 he earned a spot on Canada’s wrestling delegation to that year’s Summer Olympics. With only four competitors in the light-heavyweight division, Madison finished last, losing by a fall in under two and a half minutes to eventual bronze medalist Eddie Scarf of Australia and then again to upcoming champion Peter Mehringer of the United States in just under fifteen minutes. After the Olympics Madison’s career was confined to smaller, provincial events in his native Quebec and he made his living working for Canadian Pacific Railway. For much of his career he was blind in one eye, having lost it when a bullet exploded in a hunting accident. Longevity was his virtue, however, and he was active in wrestling until 1954, by which time he had become known for his quirky style, most notably his trademark of entering and fighting in the arena bare-footed, and garnered a reputation for doing whatever it took to win. While profiling one of Madison’s rivals in May 1953, for example, the News and Eastern Townships Advocate of Quebec alleged that Madison had “sent at least 18 wrestlers to hospital by using his illegal tactics”. He remained a tough character throughout his life and was arrested at the age of 80 for beating up two younger men who had been harassing him in a bar.",

In 1907 he wrote a revolutionary book entitled The Internal Wiring of Buildings.

The following year, Gandler won a gold medal in the relay at the 1999 World Championships, skiing with Alois Stadlober, Mikhail Botwinov, and Christian Hoffmann.

That last event was not only remarkable for Mastenbroek losing to compatriot Nida Senff, but also for the fact that Senff had missed the turning point and had to swim back to touch the wall. She nevertheless caught up with Mastenbroek and passed her to win the gold. Two years earlier, Mastenbroek had competed in the same four events at the European Championships in Magdeburg, and had won the same four medals – the only difference being that she won the backstroke, but lost to another compatriot (Willy den Ouden) in the 100 free.

His hockey career, however, was taking off in all different directions: he was also recruited by Western International Hockey League’s Trail Smoke Eaters in preparation for the 1961 ice hockey World Championships, and also by the Kitchener-Waterloo Dutchmen to join Canada’s team at the 1960 Winter Olympics. At the Olympics, he played in seven games, scored one goal, and took home a silver medal. At the World Championships his team fared even better, taking home the gold medal as a member of the last amateur team ever to defeat the Soviets in an international tournament. He then spent several years, from 1960 through 1968, in the American Hockey League with the Rochester Americans, but also began a career in the National Hockey League with the Toronto Maple Leafs, playing two games with them in the 1965-1966 season. He played an additional 17 games with the team in the 1967-68 season before joining the Vancouver Canucks for the 1968-1969 season while they were still part of the now-defunct Western Hockey League. He moved to the NHL’s Minnesota North Stars in 1969, while also playing ten games for the Central Hockey League’s Iowa Stars in their only season with the league. He rejoined the Canucks (now a part of the NHL) and the Americans the following year, in what would be his final year in the NHL. He played two more seasons with the Americans, and seven more with the Ontario Hockey Association’s senior level Barrie Flyers, before retiring from playing hockey in 1978. Sly coached the Flyers from 1971-1973, and again in the 1975-1976 season, but did not retire from coaching until 1987, the year his Collingwood Shipbuilders took the Ontario Hockey Association’s Senior “A” championship.

One of his last track or road races was at Hastings in 1924, one month before his 37th birthday. He then turned to hill-climbing which took him to events across Europe. Ernie was an electrician by trade but, in 1918, had started Merlin cycles with his brother Gus (Augustus), who was also a keen cyclist. Ernie lost his life when he was knocked off his bike in a collision with a car in 1959.",Listed in Olympians Who Died in Motor Vehicle Accidents (Boat/Car/Motorcycle/Train) (Died after being knocked off his bike following a collision with a car.)
1005638,Johnny McMillan,Male,,,, Great Britain,GBR,"Johnny McMillan’s amateur career was brief. He shot to fame in 1924 by beating Jim McKenzie of Leith to win the Scottish ABA flyweight title. He then went to London to compete in the national ABA Championships, but was eliminated by the defending champion Teddy Warwick, who went on to retain his title by beating McKenzie in the final. All three men were selected for the Paris Olympics, with McMillan a reserve. After a brief amateur career, Glaswegian McMillan turned professional in 1925 and fought as a featherweight. Despite losing his début fight to Frenchman Charly Sauvage at Manchester in December that year, McMillan went on to box in the paid ranks for 11 years until losing to Frank McCudden in the final eliminator for the Scottish title at the Parkhead Stadium in July 1936. McMillan ended with a record of 39 wins, 18 losses and two draws in a 59-fight career. Between 1930-32 he engaged in 15 bouts in the USA with a creditable 9-5-1 record. Despite holding Scottish area titles, McMillan had just one crack at the British featherweight title but lost on points over 15 rounds to Seaman Tommy Watson at Glasgow’s Kelvin Hall in 1934. It was unfortunate for McMillan that, after finishing his heavy training just a couple of days before the fight, he had a fall while out riding and injured his arm, which hindered him throughout the contest. As a keen trade unionist McMillan continued his involvement with the sport after retirement and was the Glasgow secretary of the National Union of Boxers.",

920354,Paul Landowski,Male,1 June 1875,,, France,FRA,"Paul Landowski graduated from the French national academy. He won the Prix de Rome in 1900 for his statue of David and went on to a long lasting career producing over 45 monuments in Paris and the surrounding area. Among those is the Art Nouveau figure of St. Geneviève on the Pont de la Tournelle. He also created Les Fantomes, the French Memorial for the Second Battle of the Marne, now located at the Butte de Chalmont in Northern France. In 1928, he won the gold medal in the Art Competitions for his Statue Boxer. His best-known work is the Christ the Redeemer statue in Rio de Janeiro, finished in 1931 in association with civil engineer Heitor da Silva Costa. In 1920 he became a Knight of the Legion of Honor. Beginning in 1929, Landowski ran a master atelier at the École des Beaux-Arts and from 1933-37 he was Director of the French Academy in Roma. He then became director of the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris. His children also became famous artists: the painter Nadine (1908-43), the composer and cultural politician Marcel (1915-99), and the pianist and painter Françoise (1917-2007). The statue for which Landowski was awarded the gold medal in 1928 shows the French professional boxer Georges Carpentier, who acted as a model for him in 1920. A 100 cm high version of the bronze statue is in the Musée des Années Trente in Boulogne-Billancourt, which is dedicated to Landowski’s works. It is noteworthy that the medal-winning work is neither listed in the exhibition catalog nor shown in the 1928 Official Report. Perhaps Le Pugiliste entered in 1924 is the life-size model for the statue of 1928. Le boxeur tombé (also called Knock-down), was created in 1921 with the dimensions of 41 x 32 x 50 cm and was supposed to be part of a series of four sculptures dedicated to boxing: a fallen boxer, a boxer putting on the bandages (not realized), a fight (not realized) and a standing boxer. L’Aviation may be the Monument to Wilbur Wright and the Forerunners of Aviation, which Landowski created in 1917-1919 together with architect Paul Bigot. Both received the first assignment for the – with plinth – 11 m high monument in 1912. The planning, however, was interrupted by the World War I. The monument was inaugurated in 1920 on the Place des Jacobins in Le Mans. The figure that crowns the monument is also available as a more than 2 m large plaster or bronze figure. Maybe only this was submitted in Paris.",

In a career that began in high school, and then at Oregon State, he was never defeated, winning three AAU titles in 1921, 1922, and 1924. He was not tremendously strong but worked endlessly on improving his moves to better himself. He was also a bit of a character. While hitchhiking his way across the country to join the 1924 Olympic team in New York, he stopped at Iowa State and asked the coach if he could work out when the team came to practice. When the coach refused, Reed asked if he could if he pinned every man on the team. He then stood in the doorway and grabbed each team member as he came to practice, pinning all of them in quick succession. Reed weighed only 135 lbs., but at the Paris Olympics he won a bet when he pinned Harry Steel, the American heavyweight gold medalist, five times within 15 minutes. After retiring from a short, yet brilliant competitive career, Reed went into coaching and had a short stay as a professional wrestler before becoming a land developer on the Oregon coast.",

45231,John Konrads,Male,21 May 1942,179.0,84, Australia,AUS,"Born in Latvia, John Konrads’ family left for Germany in August 1944, fleeing from the Soviet troops who reoccupied Latvia after the German occupation of 1941-44. The Konrads family stayed in Germany at a refugee camp until 1949, when they were relocated to Australia after the United States refused their immigration application on account of the family’s large size. Taught to swim by his father, John Konrads was selected for the Australian 1956 Olympic team as a reserve after winning the national 440 yds freestyle junior title. But his breakthrough year as an international swimmer came in 1958, establishing himself as the best freestyle swimmer in the World in the late 1950s. In January 1958, in the space of eight days, Konrads set freestyle world records in the 200 metres (2:04.8), 220 yards, 400 metres (4:25.9), 440 yards, 800 metres (9:17.7) and 880 yards. He set another eight world records in February and March 1958, and won the 220, 440 and one mile freestyles at the Australian Championships. At the 1958 British Empire and Commonwealth Games, Konrads won the 440 yds, one mile and 4x220 yds freestyle relay gold medals. In 1959 he set six world records in the same six events as he did in January the previous year, including 2:02.2 for 200 m, 4:21.8 and 4:19.0 in the 400, and 8:59.6 for 800 m, and was the first person to sweep the freestyle events from 110 yds to 1 mile at the Australian Championships, winning the Helms Award as the best Australian athlete of the year. In 1960, Konrads won the 220, 440, and one mile freestyles at the Australian championships and, after setting world records of 4:15.9 in 400 m, 17:11.0 in 1,500 m freestyle and 8:16.6 in the 4x2 free relay, went to the 1960 Olympics as a heavy favorite in the 400 and 1,500. At the Olympics, Konrads surprisingly did not win the 400 in his first event at the Olympics, barely taking bronze after a photo finish, but a couple of days later easily won the 1,500, and then added a bronze in the 4x200 free relay. After the Olympics, Konrads enrolled at the University of Southern California, graduating with a marketing degree, but he never reached his levels of 1958-60 and although he tried to defend his 1,500 m Olympic title in 1964, he qualified only for the Australian 4x200 relay team, swimming in the heats at the Olympics. After retiring from competition, Konrads became a swimming coach, and later worked with L’Oréal, eventually rising to the directorship of the Australasian division, and later established a consultancy and advertising firm.

For many years, however, Dale’s time was split between boxing and his fledgling acting career, and he had several small television roles in the early 1980s. He gave up on acting in 1982, however, when he began representing Canada in boxing on the international stage. After an eleventh-place finish at the World Championships that year, he attended the 1982 Commonwealth Games and the 1983 Pan American and was eliminated from both tournaments following controversial judging decisions. He then entered the bantamweight division at the 1984 Summer Olympics where he was more successful: after receiving a bye in the opening round, he defeated Mustapha Kouchene of Algeria, Hiroaki Takami of Japan, and Pedro Décima of Argentina, before being bested by Héctor López of Mexico, the eventual silver medalist, and taking home bronze. Walters turned professional shortly after the Games, having never been defeated by another Canadian boxer, or on Canadian soil, as an amateur boxer, and having held three national titles in his division from 1982 through 1984. He had suffered a serious hand injury during the final years of his amateur career, however, which curtailed his professional one: after six straight wins, he lost the bout for the Canadian featherweight title to Tony Pep and retired in the aftermath. He then worked as boxing broadcaster and a trainer at his facility, Ringside Fitness, in Vancouver.

He had two books published: “Thoughts on Riding” (1955), and “Training the Horse” (1964). In 1990, the then 91-year-old Brigadier Bolton was fined £100 for driving without due care and attention, but won his right in court to carry on driving, when he convinced magistrates he was still fit to drive.

After beating Yugoslavia 3-2 in the qualifying round, the Yugoslavians filed a protest against the referee, claiming he had been too much in their own favour.

However, after a fall-out with his father, Barker left the family home, and spent 18 months with the famous Chipperfield’s Circus. As a show jumper, Barker was associated with two well-known horses, Mister Softee and Franco. He won the 1962 men’s European Championship at the White City, London, on Mister Softee. The horse went on to win the title on two more occasions (1967 and 1969) with David Broome in the saddle. In 1962, Barker and Mister Softee cleared 2.18m (7ft 2in) in a puissance competition at Madison Square Garden, New York. At the 1960 Roma Olympics, Barker partnered Franco, a former thoroughbred race horse he bought in 1958. In the team event at the Olympics, Franco had three refusals which resulted in Barker being eliminated and, as the first British rider, put paid to their chances of a medal. However, Barker went on to enjoy success aboard Franco at notable events across Europe. Caroline Bradley also later had considerable success with Franco. After selling Franco, Barker bought a stud in Buckinghamshire, and also devoted time to his first love of foxhunting with the Whaddon Chase, of which he eventually became Master. He later became huntsman of the Meynell and South Staffordshire Hunt. After retiring from hunting Barker and his wife kennelled hunting hounds. During his time at the Meynell and South Staffordshire, the Prince of Wales used to ride with Barker, and on one occasion, Barker maintained he once told the Prince to get off his horse while Barker took it over a fence for him, saying: “You’re the heir to the throne. If you sit on the throne like you sit on that horse, you’ll not stay there long.” The prince attended David Barker’s funeral at Ellastone, Staffordshire, in 2018, and when he was the guest editor of Country Life in 2013, the Prince had nominated David Barker as one of his “heroes of the countryside”.",Cousin of David B.

77808,Babe Didrikson,Female,26 June 1911,169.0,57, United States,USA,"One of seven children of Norwegian immigrants, Babe Didrikson Zaharias is often considered the greatest female athlete of all-time, and is often in the discussion of the greatest female golfer ever. Babe played almost every sport but became famous to the American sporting public with her feats in track & field in 1932. Her track career was brief but brilliant and her performance at the 1932 AAU meet remains among the greatest in sporting history. In the space of 2½ hours she competed in eight events, winning four of them outright and finishing equal first in another. As the only representative of her club, Employers Casualty AA of Dallas, she won the national team championship with the powerful Illinois Women’s AC, who fielded more than 20 athletes, in second place. At the end of the day the score was Didrikson - 30 points, Illinois - 22 points. At the 1932 Olympics, Babe opened her Olympic campaign by winning the javelin on her first throw with a new Olympic record, she then equalled the world record (11.8) in the heats of the 80 meter hurdles and the following day brought the record down to 11.7 as she took her second gold medal. Finally she placed second in the high jump after a controversial jump-off with Jean Shiley. The judges ruled that Didrikson had dived over the bar although she had been using the same style throughout the competition. Prior to the Games the Babe had already been voted an all-American in basketball for three years and, as a 17-year-old, she twice broke the world javelin record in 1930. Babe forfeited her amateur status after the Olympics by allowing her name to be used in an automobile advertisement, so she then turned her attention to golf and was easily the greatest woman golfer of her era. In 1934 Babe won the first tournament she entered and, until cancer ended her career in 1955, she won multiple major titles, including the 1946 US Women’s Amateur and the 1947 British Ladies’ Amateur (the first American to ever win both of those championships). She also played in three men’s PGA Tour events in 1945, making all three cuts at the Los Angeles, Phoenix, and Tucson Opens. From 1948 to 1951, she was the leading money winner on the LPGA circuit, during the first four years of its existence, and she won 41 LPGA sanctioned events in her career. This included 10 major professional titles, the US Open in 1948, 1950, and 1954, the Western Open in 1940, 1944-45, and 1950, and the Titleholders in 1947, 1950, and 1952. Better known professionally under her married name of Babe Zaharias, she contracted colon cancer in 1953 but recovered from major surgery to win the 1954 US Open, and two tournaments in 1955, before dying from cancer at the age of 44. Babe was considered the most popular golfer of her day, male or female, and it has been said her popularity in golf is rivaled only by Arnold Palmer’s. Her awards are almost too numerous to mention. In 1950 she was voted the Greatest Female Athlete of the First Half of the Century, and she was voted Female Athlete of the Year by the Associated Press six times. In 1999 the Associated Press voted her as Woman Athlete of the 20th Century, while Sports Illustrated placed her second behind the heptathlete Jackie Joyner-Kersee. She is a member of the LPGA Hall of Fame and the World Golf Hall of Fame. In 1957 she was posthumously given the Bob Jones Award by the US Golf Association, in recognition of distinguished sportsmanship in golf.

Scharff was excluded in 1933 from his teaching job and was transferred to Düsseldorf. Although initially a member of the NSDAP, he was not allowed to work after 1937 and was eventually banned from the party. In total, 46 of his works were destroyed as degenerate art. After the war, Scharff taught at the State Art School in Hamburg. Scharff started as a graphic artist and was a founding member of the München New Secession. From 1902 he attended the School of Applied Arts in München. In 1907 he received a scholarship to travel to Italy, France and Spain and then lived in Paris from 1912-1913. He was severely wounded in World War I, spending a year in hospital. After the war he turned to sculpturing. He was a professor in Berlin from 1923. His style was a mix of Cubism and Expressionism. In 1955 and 1959 his works were shown at documenta 1 and 2 in Kassel. In 1999, an Edwin Scharff Museum was opened in Neu-Ulm. The Medal awarded with a bronze medal depicts an archer. Scharff complained that four copies of his work were cast in bronze without his permission. He gave a copy to the archives of the Reichssportwart, one went to Amsterdam, and two remained with him. He also bore the expenses himself. The medal was one of several designs for the permanent Olympic winner’s medal. Twenty-four years after his bronze medal, Edwin Scharff presented his Young men with horses at the Olympic art exposition. It is likely a bronze relief, which actually represents a motif from the Christmas story, originally titled Outside with the herds - with horses. The relief was created in 1946 in the format 117 x 100 x 5 cm and is in the municipal collections Neu-Ulm. Although mainly active as a sculptor, Scharff also submitted the drawing Rider. It was drawn in black with pen and brush on paper in 1952. The sheet has the format 59.5 x 42.5 cm and is in the collection of the Städel Museum in Frankfurt am Main.",

In 1907 two strands of his life came together when, quoting from “High Tide at Gettysburg” in a closing address which was reported as having both judge and jury in tears, he defended his own son on a charge of first degree murder. The case ended in an acquittal on the grounds of insanity. Along with his brother Maurice, he was one of the founders of The American Archery Association in 1878 and was to win the national championship on five occasions between 1879 and 1908.",

3448,John McCluskey,Male,23 January 1944,166.0,51, Great Britain,GBR,"At a time when British boxing was at low ebb in the lower weight divisions, the Scottish town of Hamilton produced the only two flyweights who could campaign at an international level with even moderate success. Following in the footsteps of future World professional champion Walter McGowan, fellow Hamiltonian John McCluskey won Scottish and British Amateur championships in 1964 and was chosen to box for Great Britain at the Tokyo Olympics. After defeating a Thai opponent in his first Olympic bout he was conclusively defeated by Stanislav Sorokin in the round of sixteen. He opted to stay as an amateur for one more year and, having retained his Scottish and British titles, ended his career in the unpaid ranks by winning a bronze medal at the 1965 European Championships. By the end of the year he had made his debut as a professional and fifteen months later defeated the much more experienced Tony Barlow to win the British Flyweight title in only his 8th professional fight. Thereafter his career followed a recurring pattern as he dominated domestic opposition and held the national title for 8 years but, despite three attempts at the European title, he never broke through to compete at the highest level. He fought Fernando Atzori, the Olympic champion at flyweight in Tokyo, on three occasions but lost all three fights. The highlight of his career came in 1970 when he outpointed previously undefeated Australian Harry Hayes for the Commonwealth flyweight title although his reign ended with a defeat in his first defence. After he suffered a first round knockout at the hands of Wayne Evans, McCluskey retired at the end of 1975 with a career record of 23 wins and 15 defeats from his 38 fights. McCluskey coached boxing and swimming in his native Hamilton for many years afterwards.",

As she felt that the chances for improvement on her ninth place at the 1977 European Figure Skating Championships were limited, she turned to speed skating and became one of the most successful speed skaters in history. At three Olympics between 1980 and 1988, she won eight medals (three gold, four silver and one bronze), which remains an Olympic record for speed skating as of 2018, although since equalled by Gunda Niemann-Stirnemann. Her record at World Championships was even more impressive. She won the sprint title a record six times (1980-81, 1983-84, 1986-87) and her five victories in the all-round event were also a record for the Championships. She emulated the great Eric Heiden by winning the sprint/allround double in 1984, 1986, and 1987, only missing the 1985 Championships because of pregnancy. Enke also bettered a total of 16 world records, most notably in the 1,500 m. Her 1:59.30, skated at the high altitude rink at Medeo in present-day Kazakhstan was 3 seconds better than her own former world record, and the first woman to finish in less than 2 minutes. The record stood for 10 years, when it was broken by Catriona Le May Doan, with help of the clap skate. Her first world record was set in December 1980 in the mini-combination at Chemnitz, Germany. During her career she set world records in the 500 once, the 1,000 twice, the 1,500 three times, and once each in the 3,000 and 5,000 metres. She also set five world records in the mini-combination, two in the small-combination and one in the sprint combination. Enke also recorded 37 national records in the GDR between 1979 and 1987. At GDR national championships, she won a total of 17 titles, at least one in each of the events: allround (1982-83), sprint (1984, 1986), 500 m (1981, 1987), 1,000 m (1980, 1983-84, 1986, 1988), 1,500 m (1983-84, 1988), 3,000 m (1983) and 5,000 m (1983).

He was then appointed to the position of garden director of Charlottenburg (Berlin), and from 1926 he was the city garden director of Berlin. At the same time he taught first as a lecturer and then as an honorary professor at the Technical University Char-lottenburg. In 1929 he was named first professor of garden design in Germany at the Agricultural College Berlin. His progressive blindness and the seizure of power by the National Socialists led to his suicide in 1933. One of the parks that Barth planned in Berlin was the Volkspark Jungfernheide in Charlottenburg. He was commissioned with the plant before World War I, but the implementation of the post-war plans did not take place until the 1920s. In 1927, the complex was completed with sports fields, a swimming pool, and children’s playground, and the opening took place in 1923.

Here, they planned a water sports facility (Ilz, 1936) and a sports complex with a sports settlement (Pfann, 1932), but the plan was not realized. Ilz studied at the Technical High School in Wien (Vienna). His career started with town planning projects mainly in Wien and from 1925-36 he often worked with Pfann. At the Technical High School, he later was appointed professor of urban planning, and served as dean of his faculty from 1938-45. During this time, he designed urban plannings for Wien, Praha and Znojmo. In 1934 Ilz became an internal architect at the Künstlerhaus Wien, where the National Socialists began to restructure the institution in the Nazi mold. Ilz was thus discarded from the list of institutional members in 1945, but due to a change in the legal situation, only three years later he was reinstated as a member by common consent. He eventually worked as a town planner in Salzburg, mostly planning buildings in a conservative style. He died on his 63rd birthday.",

After receiving a bye in round one, he defeated R. Landesmann of France and Karel Istaz of Belgium in the next two rounds and remained the only wrestler without any bad points.

This took him to the final against Henry Wittenberg of the United States, which he lost in a 2-1 decision, therefore settling for a silver medal. Four years later he returned to the Olympics, this time as a bobsledder, and came in fourth in the four-man event alongside Felix Endrich, Franz Kapus, and Werner Spring. His bobsledding career seemed on the rise at the 1953 World Championships, where he and Endrich won the two-man event, but tragedy struck when an accident during a practice run for the four-man claimed Endrich’s life.

Although McCulloch was exactly half Blackstaffe’s age, the final proved be the finest race of the Olympic Regatta and it was impossible to pick the winner until the last 50 yards when Blackstaffe held on to his light advantage to become the oldest sculling champion in Olympic history. After this great victory, Blackstaffe retired and ended a career which had brought him nine victories in the London Cup, five wins in the Wingfield Sculls and one victory in the Diamond Sculls. All these successes proved particularly gratifying to a man who, because he was a butcher, initially experienced great difficulty in having his entry accepted for Henley. Following his Olympic victory, Blackstaffe was made a Freeman of the City of London and at the time of his death he was Senior Life Vice-President of the Amateur Rowing Association. Blackstaffe was also a useful cross-country runner and represented South London Harriers in the National Championships. In 1903 he won the Nicholson Cup 10-mile race, and in the field was Alf Shrubb, who went on to win the International Cross Country Championship just two months later. Blackstaffe’s all-round sporting ability extended further, to boxing. A member of the Amateur Boxing Association, he regularly refereed at the ABA Championships and was one of the officials at the 1908 London Olympics.",

He won the silver medals for his works Euryale (1924), The Argonauts (1932), and The Olympic Champion (1948). He was a Danish writer who often used antique or medieval motifs between 1910 and 1949. He was the son of a vicar and a maternal grandson of the Norwegian poet Johann Sebastian Welhaven. In his lifetime Petersen was better known for his work as a journalist and foreign correspondent. He also tried his hand at painting. Although he has never been fully recognized by Danish literary critics, his work was respected by contemporary historians for its knowledge of and identification with Antique cultures. Therefore, it doesn’t come as a surprise that he won his Olympic Medals using antique Greek athlete motifs. He was always interested in sports and athletics and took part in the last Danish duel in 1913. Euryale is a prose text about the mythical origins of Olympia. In Greek mythology, the figure is one of the three Gorgons, sister of Medusa and Stheno. The book was published in 1928, the year of the Olympics. His work submitted in 1932 was modeled on the Argonauts’ myth, which he retold in a literarily edited form. In the same year the work was released as a book.

He turned it into the consummate team game, where defensive ability, rebounding and hustle were as important as great offensive skills. Bill Russell played for the University of San Francisco, the 1956 Olympic team, and the Boston Celtics. But one rarely finds Russell’s name in the individual record book as most of the records were set by his arch-rival, Wilt Chamberlain. However, when it counted, Russell’s character refused to allow his team to lose. In 17 attempts to win championships with these clubs, he succeeded 14 times, and one loss occurred when he was injured in the NBA championship finals. Besides his gold medal, he played on two NCAA championship teams, and 11 NBA champs with the Celtics – eight of those in succession. Russell was five times the NBA’s Most Valuable Player, and was virtually always first or second-team All-NBA, often alternating the honor with Chamberlain. He was named The Sporting News’ Athlete of the Decade in 1970, and also was named Sportsman of the Year by Sports Illustrated. After his retirement he was elected to the Basketball Hall of Fame in 1974 and, in perhaps his greatest honor, was named the NBA’s greatest player ever in a poll of basketball writers. Russell also coached in the NBA, but with mixed success. He started as a player-coach with the Celtics in his last two playing years.","Listed in Olympians Who Won Olympic, NCAA and NBA Basketball Titles (Olympic Champion: 1956; NCAA Champion: 1955-56 University of San Francisco; NBA Champion: 1957, 1959-66, 1968-69 Boston Celtics) Listed in Olympians Who Acted in Movies (On The Right Track) Listed in Olympians Who Received the US Presidential Medal of Freedom (Awarded by President Barack Obama in 2011.)

In 1966 and 1969 he was German Indoor 800 m Champion. In 1968, he was eliminated in the semifinals of the 1,500 m at the Mexico Olympics. After his athletic career he studied history, English, philosophy and sports at the University of Mainz and UCLA, graduating in 1967. He received his doctoral degree in 1971 from the University of Köln (Cologne). Afterwards he was a referent at the Deutscher Sportbund, from 1974-78 he was a scientific assistant at the Pädagogische Hochschule Berlin, from 1978-80 professor at the University of Hamburg, and since 1980 he has been professor at the Georg-August-University of Göttingen.

After this speech there were detailed investigations by the DVS, which found that Krüger had falsified some quotations, and made up some historical facts.

Howaldt was a professional marine soldier, who entered the Imperial German Navy in 1907 and in 1913 was promoted to Oberleutnant zur See.

Brooke then served as a navigator on the destroyer Douglas before joining the new battleship Prince of Wales, which set off to the North Atlantic on 24 May 1941, along with the pride of the Royal Navy fleet, the battlecruiser Hood. Their mission was to engage in battle with the German battleship Bismarck. Sadly, the Hood was sunk, and seven months later, the Prince of Wales was also sunk off Malaya. After abandoning ship and being picked up, Brooke ended up in Singapore in February 1942 from where he escaped along with 100 others, and this became one of the most amazing escape stories of World War II. After 1,600 miles and a 37-day voyage at sea under sail, the party was picked up by a merchant ship and taken to Bombay and eventual freedom from the Japanese. Brooke was awarded the DSC for putting out fires aboard the aircraft carrier Formidable in the latter part of the war, after it had been hit by a kamikaze aircraft.

He was in the winning Cambridge eight for three successive years and in the last tow years, 1935 and 1936, he was the stroke. Later in 1936 he stroked the British eight that finished fourth at the Berlin Olympics but possibly his greatest performance came in the Grand in 1934, when he stroked the winning Leander eight as they set a Henley record which was to last until 1952. After the 1936 Olympics, Laurie joined the Government Service in Sudan where his friend and future Olympic partner, John Wilson was also serving. They had rowed together at Cambridge, rowing for three winning Boar Race crews. In 1938 they took their leave together and won the Goblets at Henley. Ten years later they again traveled to England from the Sudan and won the Goblets for a second time before going on to win the Olympic title. When Ran Laurie finally retired to England he qualified as a doctor. After their Olympic win, Laurie returned to the Sudan and worked there until the early 50s. He then switched careers and became a doctor, practicing in Oxford for over 30 years. In 1951 he became a Steward of the Henley Royal Regatta. Laurie was educated at Monkton Combe and Selwyn College, Cambridge. He was chairman of the Oxford Duke of Edinburgh’s Award Committee from 1959-69 and of the Save the Children Branch from 1986-89.

55733,Ben Helfgott,Male,22 November 1929,165.0,67, Great Britain,GBR,"Ben Helfgott grew up in the town of Piotrków Trybunalski in Poland and was nine years old at the time of the German invasion. In October 1939 he and his family were herded into what was to become the first Nazi created ghetto in occupied Poland. In 1942, at the age of 12, he registered for work at the local glass factory as he was led to believe that those who worked for the German war effort would not be chosen for transportation to the death camps. A man called Janota was in charge of his work unit and would continually treat Helfgott in a brutal manner. By coincidence Janota would regularly borrow a horse and cart from a friend of Ben’s father. When Janota next visited to borrow the horse Ben’s father was present and asked Janota why he treated Ben so badly. Afterwards the horse owner refused Janota permission to borrow his horse but changed his mind when Ben’s father spoke on Janota’s behalf. A few weeks later the transportations to the Triblinka extermination camp began, 22,000 out of 24,500 Jews in Piotrków were sent to their deaths. On the final day of transportations the trains were not filled to capacity and the SS marched into the glass factory and rounded up anybody they suspected was Jewish. Ben was stopped but insisted that he was a Pole and not a Jew. The SS continued to question him but at that moment Janota came over and lied to the SS that Helfgott was indeed Polish. Helfgott spent the three remaining years of the war being moved from one labour camp to another. Although weak and skeletal in appearance he survived and was liberated from the Theresienstadt concentration camp in 1945. His family were not so fortunate, his mother and 8-year-old sister were victims of a mass execution in the forests near Piotrków and his father was killed attempting to escape from a “death march” a few weeks before the end of the war. Orphaned at the age of 15, together with 731 other orphans Helfgott was sent to England and soon discovered a talent for weightlifting. He became British champion in 1954 in the featherweight division and was later three times national lightweight champion. Helfgott also won a bronze medal in 1958 British Empire Games (750 pounds, represented England) and was three times a champion at the Maccabiah Games in Israel. On both his Olympic appearances he was captain of the British weightlifting team. Educated at Plaistow Grammar School, Helfgott was a good all-round sportsman, enjoying football, athletics, gymnastics, and table tennis. At the age of 18 he went to Southampton University, from where he obtained a degree in economics. Helfgott later became a clothing manufacturer employing 120 people, and was a prominent member of the Jewish community in Britain. He helped to form a charity, the 45 Aid Society for Holocaust Survivors in the UK, served on the Board of Deputies of British Jews and was a member of the Council of the Conference on Jewish Material Claims Against Germany. He was elected to the Jewish Sport Hall of Fame in 1995. A biography of Helfgott, entitled Ben Helfgott: From Victim to Champion was published in 2000. He was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II in 2018 in recognition of his services to Holocaust remembrance and education. Following his death in 2023, tributes were paid to Helfgott by such dignitaries at the Chief Rabbi Ephraim Mirvis, and United Kingdom Prime Minister Rishi Sunak.",Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the British Empire/Commonwealth Games (0–0–1 1958 Cardiff WLT bronze: lightweight -67.5 kg (competed for England)) Listed in Olympian Members of the Nobility (Sir) Listed in Olympians Who Survived Nazi Concentration Camps (Different labor camps and at last Theresienstadt concentration camp)

He coxed the victorious Oxford crew in the 1977 Oxford-Cambridge boat race. Despite being a prospective candidate for Mrs. Thatcher’s Conservative party he rallied support against the decision of the Amateur Rowing Association to boycott the Moscow Games of 1980, a vote by the rowers themselves eventually overturning the decision. As well as a an Olympic silver he won a world championship silver medal in 1981 and represented Great Britain in the 1984 Games. Elected to the British Parliament in 1983, it came as a surprise when he was appointed Minister for Sport in 1987; it was a post he was to hold for three years. Losing his place in the House of Commons following the 1992 general election, he started a career in business. Moynihan was involved in a lengthy legal case following the death of his brother, the 3rd Baron Moynihan. He eventually won the legal right to the title of 4th Baron Moynihan when it was proved that other claimants did not have a legitimate claim to title. He is currently a member of the House of Lords and was the Shadow Minister of Sport from 2003-2005. In 2005 he was elected chairman of the British Olympic Association.","Listed in Olympians Who Competed in the Boat Race (1977 Oxford (won)) Listed in Olympian Members of the Nobility (4th Baron Moynihan) Listed in Olympic Order Recipients (2012 (Silver?))

One of his earliest instructors was a veterinarian, who had Smith closely study the anatomy of his subjects. Smith first attended the Art Students’ League in New York and then the School of Art at the Boston Museum. Smith won numerous prizes including the Hallgarten Prize in 1917 and the Isidor Medal in 1921, both from the National Academy. He became one of the founders of the Rockport Art Association. In 1938, he settled in Carmel, California. After his wife’s death in 1948, he moved to Mexico for a couple of years, often spending the summers in Carmel. Smith eventually settled in Carmel permanently. Smith was an American impressionist who was known for his illustrations, landscapes, equestrian portraits, and etchings. He not only worked in oil and watercolors, but did also a variety of graphics, often using as subject matter the horses, Indians and cowboys of the West. Much of his work was published in “Harper’s Monthly” magazine. During World War II, he painted horses in the Sierras. All of his six works submitted in 1932 showed equestrian scenes. Three of them were paintings, probably in oil. The Water Jump (102 x 127 cm) could be reliably identified. Polo at Myopia was represented in the catalog of art competitions, but without further details. Myopia Polo is the oldest active polo club in the United States and is located in South Hamilton, Massachusetts. Three identified artworks were etchings with equestrian motifs. Known are the sizes of Go (19 x 25 cm) and Before the Start (15 x 20 cm). The etchings were already exhibited in Boston in 1930.",

3943,Tony Byrne,Male,6 July 1930,,, Ireland,IRL,"Tony Byrne was born into a poor family and got interested in boxing at a young age. His hard-working mother, who kept the family of eight kids together on meager earnings from cleaning a church in the 1930s, couldn’t afford the proper boots, so Byrne fought in his socks during his junior years, thus earning the nickname Socks. And there were big doubts whether Byrne could compete at the 1956 Olympics, as in those days, athletes had to pay their own way to the Olympics. Byrne worked as the town bread man making deliveries with a horse and cart at that time and did not have the funds to travel Australia, so a fundraising campaign under the banner of “Send Byrne to Melbourne” was created, and it raised £653 from local businesses in Drogheda to send him to the Olympics. Captain of the Irish boxing team, Byrne carried the Irish flag at the Opening Ceremony and won a bronze medal after losing his semifinal to German Harry Kurschat on a split decision. But Byrne’s best fight came a couple of weeks after the Olympics, when in January 1957 he beat the Melbourne gold medalist Dick McTaggart, in an Ireland-England dual meet. Byrne never turned professional and during his career won 201 of 208 amateur bouts. In 1962, Byrne emigrated to Canada with his family and settled in Edmonton, where he worked at a local meat packing plant and later on a city maintenance crew. He also coached kids at the North Edmonton Boxing Club.",

Kramsztyk painted realistic scenes of the ghetto and their Jewish people. He studied drawing and painting in Warszawa, Kraków, and München, and was influenced mostly by impressionism, before living in Paris from 1910-14. From 1915-24 he lived in Warszawa where he was a co-founder (1922) of the Rytm Association of Polish Artists, one of the leading artistic groups during the 1920s. He then returned to Paris, visiting his home country just once a year. In those times he painted portraits, figurative scenes, still lifes and female nudes, strongly influenced by French post-impressionism. In 1939, while in Poland, Kramsztyk was caught by surprise by the outbreak of World War II. He then joined the Warszawa ghetto, although he previously never felt Jewish and did not speak Yiddish. The resulting drawings strongly documented the imprisonment, poverty, hunger and death of Jews during the Holocaust. He was shot on 6 August 1942 during the deportation of Jews from the Warszawa ghetto to the Treblinka concentration camp. His death was described by an eyewitness: “The man carried out of the apartment was not walking down the stairs fast enough and a German just shot him in the back of his head. Because in the ghetto there was a rule that you had to move quickly, even to your own death.” One of Kramsztyk’s best friends in the ghetto was pianist and writer Władysław Szpilman (1911-2000), about whom the award-winning film “The Pianist” was made. The submitted picture The Sailboat “Albatros” was reproduced in the art catalog but was created not later than 1924.",Listed in Olympians Who Were Killed or Missing in Action or Died as a Result of War (Kramsztyk was Jewish and was murdered in 1942 in the midst of his pictures by the German SS in the Warsaw ghetto as a demonstration of their strength.)

In 1912 he won the Dunlop Trophy race and in 1920 was selected to represent Canada at the 1920 Summer Olympics, coming in 38th among 42 finishers in the road race. As two of his teammates, Norman Webster and Harold Bounsall, failed to finish the race, with Herb McDonald coming in 31st, the Canadians did not place in the team rankings. Martin remained active in cycling after the Games and even proposed a 30-day, 3,000 mile bicycle tour from Toronto to Los Angeles as late as May 1922, but less than three months later he died in a Weston, Ontario sanitarium of an acute illness.",

91563,Alina Kabayeva,Female,12 May 1983,164.0,46, Russian Federation,RUS,"Debuting internationally at age 13, Alina Kabayeva won her first world title (rope) in 1998. She upgraded to four golds and two silvers the following year in Osaka, including the overall and team titles. Her dominant performances made her the top favourite for the Olympic title at Sydney, but she “only” placed third after dropping her hoop in one of the exercises. Now aiming for the gold in Athens, she won a cart-load of medals at the European Championships in 2001 and 2002, and again brought home four world titles in 2003. She had also won world titles in 2001, but lost her medals when she was convicted of doping use at the 2001 Goodwill Games. She was not banned from competition as counterfeit medicine had been the cause of the conviction. Kabayeva fulfilled her goal and dominantly won the Olympic gold in Athens, retiring shortly afterwards. Kabayeva then turned her attention to politics, serving two years in the Public Chamber before being elected into the Duma, the lower house of Russian parliament. Representing Vladimir Putin’s Yedinaya Rossiya party, she was romantically linked to the Russian president, but both parties denied these claims. She also returned to gymnastics, winning the 2007 world title with the Russian team. Kabayeva was chosen as one of the torch bearers to bring in the Olympic Torch at the 2014 Sochi Opening Ceremony.",Torchbearer within the Olympic Stadium at the Opening Ceremony of the 2014 Winter Olympics (Torch bearer within stadium) Listed in Olympians Who Were Members of National Legislatures (Member of Russian Duma since 2007 (Edinaya Rossiya))
