Send the greetings to whom the hell you like.” Häggblad became a merchant with a well-known sports store.

He competed in the road race at the 1996 Olympics, just missing the podium with a fourth-place finish, although he was not in the final pack of three that contested the podium positions. After the 1988 Olympics, Andreu joined the 7-Eleven professional team that became Motorola in 1991, and continued to ride with them through the 1996 season. He then spent a year with Cofidis, but in 1998 returned and rode from 1998-2000 with US Postal Service, the former Motorola team. Throughout his professional career, Andreu was basically a domestique, and with Motorola / US Postal, he rode primarily in support of Lance Armstrong, at one time a close friend. Andreu had only a few wins as a professional. He won stage seven of the 1994 Tour of Poland, stage six at the 1997 Mi-Août Bretonne, and stage five of the 1998 Tour du Luxembourg. In classics his best finish was ninth at the 1994 Paris-Roubaix, while his best major stage race finish was eighth on GC at the 2000 Paris-Nice. Andreu retired after the 2000 season and became an announcer for televised cycling in the US. But problems arose with Armstrong, after Lance’s cancer diagnosis and treatment. Andreu and his wife, Betsy, were in a hospital room with Armstrong when Betsy claimed to have heard Armstrong admit to a doctor his litany of drug usage. Betsy was a bulldog on this and demanded that Armstrong admit his use of PEDs when he started winning the Tour de France and other races in the late 1990s, and this caused a major rift between Andreu and Armstrong. As Armstrong was the most powerful rider in the sport, it also made it more difficult for Andreu to get hired by bicycle companies. Eventually, Armstrong’s house of cards collapsed and he admitted to years of PED usage in 2012, proving Betsy Andreu correct.",

The Polo Player was created in 1929 also for Augarten. At 21.5 cm and 0.8 kg, it is slightly smaller than the figures of the Spanish Riding School. According to the illustrations in the exhibition catalog, the submitted figures were unpainted.

920534,Heath Robinson,Male,31 May 1872,,, Great Britain,GBR,"Heath Robinson entered three of his works in the 1932 Olympic Art competition and the titles of them highlight the eccentricity of his style; when you look at one of his entries, Machines for Clearing Out Holes in Golf Courses, you get some idea of what he created most of the time. It was a drawing of a magnificent and ornate, yet fairly useless, machine for cleaning out holes in golf courses. Many of his works were along these lines hence, when you hear the expression “It is Heath Robinson”, it is a phrase meaning: “An absurdly ingenious and impracticable device” and the expression entered the English language in 1912. Robinson must be one of the few, if not only, Olympians to have an entry in the Oxford English Dictionary named after them. Robinson was born into a family of artists, as he and his brothers Charles and Thomas followed in the footsteps of their father Thomas, Sr., who was a writer, artist and chief illustrator for the Penny Illustrated Paper, and they had an uncle who worked on the “Illustrated London News”. Another of Robinson’s brothers, George, was a publisher’s manager. Robinson studied at the Islington Art College and then the Royal Academy. He had wanted to be a landscape artist but his career started as a book illustrator and his early works included Don Quixote, 1001 Nights and Hans Christian Andersen’s Fairy Tales. He then obtained commissions working for the magazines Tatler and The Sketch, which eventually took him into drawing cartoons of weird contraptions. One of the many contraptions he drew was a camera to enable a person to take a photograph of themselves. And who said the “selfie” was a modern-day thing? Despite his elaborate designs, Robinson was not an engineer and it is doubtful that any of his creations would actually have worked. His work was not entirely restricted to the drawing of weird and wonderful contraptions. He made scenery for the Alhambra and Empire theatres in London and provided murals for the Knickerbocker Bar and the children’s room on the cruise liner the Empress of Britain. Robinson had four sons and a daughter. Three of his sons, Quentin, Oliver and Tom, all served in the Army in the second World War, while his daughter Joan was a nurse. His fourth son Alan was a monk. Plans for a Heath Robinson Museum at Pinner, London, were announced in June 2014. The “Ice Hole” Clam Spearer in the Frozen North appeared in 1928 as part of a series in the Illustrated Sporting & Dramatic News titled Very Patent Aides to Sport. In 1934 the drawing was also included in the book Absurdities - a Book of Collected Drawings in the format 20 x 28 cm. Machines for Clearing Out Holes in Golf Courses was the first in the series Very Patent Aides to Sport with the full caption ”Screw-Em-Out” golf hole cleaner in action on a golf course. The complete title of the last drawing reads Carrying out the correspondence course for mountain climbing in the home (in the catalog: Learning Mountain Climbing in the Home), published in The Sportsman in 1928.

Hurd served in the Navy during World War II, where he was a surface warfare officer on destroyer escorts in the North Atlantic.

After the war, he lived in San Francisco for a few years, working as an attorney with Pillsbury, Madison & Sutro, primarily working for Standard Oil, and then joining them in their land development section. Hurd then joined with Radcliffe Killam to start Killam & Hurd, an independent oil and gas exploration and production company based in Laredo, Texas.

His father, Captain Cyril Hardy was a captain in the Irish Army at the formation of the Free State, a founding member of the Irish show jumping team, a brilliant amateur jockey and later, the trainer of the winning horse in the 1944 Irish Grand National. Four of Eddie’s uncles, his grandfather and great-grandfather were professional jockeys. Unsurprisingly Eddie followed in their footsteps and combined being a jockey with show jumping and eventing. He was Ireland’s leading rider at the 1960 Games, placing 9th individually and leading his team to the sixth position. Following the Games, he began to concentrate more on his career as a jockey and forfeited his Olympic eligibility by following it as a professional career. He rode for some of the foremost trainers in England and Ireland, but his biggest win came as a late replacement. Highland Wedding had contested for the win at The Grand National Steeplechase in 1966 and 1967 but had lost his regular jockey for 1969 due to a broken elbow. Hardy took the ride on the twelve-year-old, hit the front halfway round the second circuit and romped clear to win by twelve lengths. He suffered a bad fall at a meeting at Cheltenham in 1971, where he suffered badly damaged nerve in his right arm. After failing to recover from the injury, he started a long and successful career as a trainer before his son, Eddie Jr, took over the running of the stable. His grandson, Patrick, joined as a partner in 2021. His brother John Harty followed an almost identical career path, appearing at the 1964 Olympics in eventing before turning professional as a jockey. The highlight of his career coming when he rode the winner of the 1980 Irish Grand National. Another brother, Cyril Jr, also had a good career as jockey and trainer while another of Eddie’s sons, Eoin, relocated to Kentucky to train and has had successes in American racing including a win at the Breeders Cup.","Brother of John Harty Listed in Olympians Who Participated in the Grand National Steeplechase as a Jockey, Trainer or Horse Owner (Winning jockey aboard Highland Wedding in 1969)"

The daughter of a solicitor from Berwick on Tweed Agatha Morton learned her tennis at Halstead, Essex, from an early age and was coached by her father and the former Scottish and Welsh champion Helen Jackson. Agatha first hit the headlines in 1902 when she won the All-England women’s doubles title with Charlotte Sterry. In 1914, when the doubles now had full championship status at Wimbledon, she teamed up with the American Elizabeth Ryan to capture the title, beating the British duo of Edith Hannam & Ethel Larcombe 6-1, 6-3. Like the women’s doubles, the All-England mixed doubles was not granted full championship status at Wimbledon until 1913 but Agatha and Herbert Roper Barrett won the title in 1909 when it was held as part of the Northern Tournament at Manchester. Agatha made her Wimbledon début when she was 29 in 1901 and played there 13 times. She reached the final of the all-comers singles championship on four occasions, losing to Muriel Robb 2-6, 4-6 in 1902, and to Charlotte Sterry in two sets in 1904. She lost to Sterry again in two sets in 1908 and in 1909 took Dora Boothby to three sets before losing 4-6, 6-4, 6-8 in one of the longest ladies finals seen at Wimbledon at that time. In those latter two years she would have been proclaimed champion had she won the all-comers finals, as the reigning champions failed to defend their titles. At Wimbledon in 1908 during the Olympic competition, she lost in the quarter-final of the singles to Dorothea Lambert Chambers 2-6. 3-6. Agatha won many provincial tournaments around England including the North London championship nine times in succession between 1906-14 and in that same period she also won the Suffolk championship nine times. She also won the Essex championship six times between 1904-11. In addition she won tournaments on clay in Germany and France.

He first became interested in art in 1890, when his family moved to Mexico City. He then apprenticed in the open workshop of José Guadalupe Posada (1851-1913), Mexico’s first great printmaker. When he was 17, however, Orozco lost his left hand in a laboratory accident, and abandoned his architectural studies. He re-entered the Academy of San Carlos in 1905 with a renewed passion for painting, and assiduously set about to become a competent painter. Orozco conscientiously began to explore Mexican themes and to draw more directly from scenes of daily life. He became a caricaturist for an opposition newspaper and haunted the barrios, or slums, of Mexico City, painting a series of watercolors dealing with the lives of prostitutes that was collectively titled House of Tears. After negative criticism he then moved to the US in 1917, returning in 1920, but again moving to the US in 1927. In 1932 he made a brief trip to Europe, where he viewed the art of England, France, Spain, and Italy, and eventually returned to Mexico with a strong reputation. Orozco became a national hero in his later years, honored as the leader among those who raised Mexican art to a position of international eminence. He published his autobiography in 1945. In 1947 the President of Mexico awarded him the Federal Quinquennial Prize, which recognized him as the outstanding Mexican figure in the arts and sciences of the preceding five years.",

After 1910 he was self-employed artistically. The First World War initially inhibited his artistic development until he traveled to Italy and North Africa on a scholarship in 1922. His comparatively simple medals are based on ancient models. Well-known medals show French politicians such as Briand and Clémenceau. In 1930 Dropsy became a professor and for 25 years director of the department of medal art at the École Nationale Supérieure des Beaux-Arts in Paris. In 1942, he was admitted to the Académie des Beaux-Arts. After the war, the Paris mint eventually honored his work. In 1947, he was a professor for one year at the École des Beaux-Arts in Cairo, Egypt. Dropsy designed the medal that was gifted to Queen Elizabeth II by Vincent Auriol, President of France from 1947-54, on the occasion of her coronation. He created another medal a few years later commemorating the Queen’s visit to France.

But the weather was warm, and the outdoor rink was beginning to soften and gradually melt. A few pairs later, the event was called off, the results voided, and Jaffee was denied any medal although several skaters, including Evensen, protested to the officials that Jaffee should be declared the champion. In 1932 Jaffee qualified again for the Olympic team and this time fared much better.

Growing up in the White Mountains of New Hampshire she started out as a runner and ski racer, and then ran track and cross-country at Southern Illinois University. Injuries hampered her progress, so she started cycling as a way to cross-train, only to find she had a talent for it. She started competing in cycling only the year after she left college. Zack was US National Champion in the road race in 1987 and 1988. She competed for the US at the 1991 World Championships, finishing fourth in the road race. At the 1991 Ore-Ida Women’s Challenge, she won four stages, but did not make the podium on GC. She again raced at the 1993 World Championships, placing fifth in the road race. Zack was on the podium in a major stage race when she finished third at the 1989 Grande Boucle Féminine Internationale, the women’s version of the Tour de France. After leaving cycling in 1993, Zack returned to ski racing, in cross-country, probably spurred into that by her husband, former Norwegian Olympic cross-country skier Audun Endestad. They later settled in Fairbanks, Alaska where they ran Alaska Heartland Adventures, serving as guides for people doing hiking, back-country skiing, and hunting, and also running ski camps and ultra-ski races. Zack-Endestad also began teaching and coaching skiing at the University of Alaska and for the Fairbanks Nordic Ski Club.",Wife of Audun Endestad

921562,John MacGilchrist,Male,12 July 1893,,, United States,USA,"Scottish-born John MacGilchrist studied architectural drawing and painted initially mainly Scottish castles. In 1913, he traveled to the United States to complete his degree in architecture at Carnegie Tech in Pittsburgh. MacGilchrist was a prominent American aviation artist who fought in World War I as a Balloon Observer for the British Royal Air Corp. Despite having been shot down four times, he survived over 200 hours of combat and chronicled images of war. After the war, MacGilchrist returned to the United States to pursue his chosen profession as an architect in Philadelphia and New York. In 1926, however, he left architecture, to follow his yearnings, and returned to his romance with airplanes. His techniques ranged from etchings and lithographs to watercolors and oil paintings. After falling into obscurity during the Great Depression his career ended and his work was only re-discovered after his death. In 1932, MacGilchrist entered three works in the graphics section of the Art Competitions. Apparently, he produced two works entitled The Race. One of them is an etching measuring 13 x 18 cm (sheet 31 x 24 cm). Zooming Laird Solution, sized 25 x 23 cm (sheet 38 x 32 cm), from 1930 was probably identical to the submitted etching Zooming. The Laird Speedwing Solution was a biplane built for flying competitions. Here it is shown above the rooftops of Chicago. The third etching (14 x 22.7 cm, sheet 24.1 x 32.1 cm) depicted the Yankee Doodle, a single-engine Lockheed Vega built since 1927. A plane of this type, nicknamed “Yankee Doodle”, was used by Captain Charles Collyer (1896-1928) and Harry Tucker (1891–1928) to fly non-stop from New York to Los Angeles in October 1928 in 24 hours and 55 minutes. A few days later, both crashed fatally with the plane in Arizona.",

Warwick was a motor car and aeroplane pioneer at the turn of the 20th century. He raced on the roads of the Isle of Man and at Blackpool before the opening of Brooklands in 1907 when he took part in the very first meeting and, driving a Darracq, came close to winning the principal race of the day, The Montagu Cup, but came to a halt on the 10th of 11 laps when leading the race. The following year he took part in the French Grand Prix at Dieppe, and also in 1908 he drove the motor boat Sea Dog in the 6-8 metres C-Class at the Olympic Games. Sadly, despite pushing the other entrant Gyrinus hard, a mechanical fault caused Wright and Sea Dog to abandon the race. Wright became something of a celebrity across Europe and mixed with some rich and famous people. He rode on the Cresta Run with such people as Lord Brabazon and King Albert of Belgium. He was also reported to have been with his former partner and fellow racing driver Huntley Walker when Walker won £12,000 at the tables in 1909 and became known as “The man who broke the bank at Monte-Carlo”. Having enjoyed success at automobile racing and motorboating, Wright and his brother Howard had the distinction of being responsible for some of the first flights in Britain in 1910, a few years after their famous American namesake, achieved the first powered flight at Kitty Hawk. In 1916 Warwick joined the Royal Naval Air Services as a flyer and served in Belgium and quickly rose through the ranks before leaving with the rank of Lieutenant Colonel. He was mentioned in dispatches and was honoured with the D.S.O. in 1918. He re-enlisted in the RNVR in World War II and won a bar to add to his D.S.O. The name Warwick Wright is synonymous with selling high-class motor cars in Central London after establishing Warwick Wright Limited in 1906. Based in New Bond Street they sold mostly Sunbeam, Talbot and Darracq marques, and in 1910 he acquired the UK rights to the Van Den Plas name. However, by the mid-1930’s the business was in difficulty and was taken over by Rootes. The Warwick Wright Limited name lived on for many years after its founder’s death in the summer of 1945.",

After losing in the national finals both Wheatcroft and Sanders joined Julie Sutton’s rink and made it to the national championship once again, only to lose after their first playoff game. Wheatcroft then disappeared from the national curling scene for a while, although she was a provincial curling mixed champion in 1989 and 1993. She resurfaced under her married name with Sutton, now known as Julie Skinner, a decade later in 1999 to join Kelley Law’s rink. Wheatcroft won her second international gold medal at the 2000 World Championships and earned the right to represent Canada at the 2002 Winter Olympics the following year. The team entered the Olympic playoffs with an 8-1 record, but a loss to Great Britain and a win against the United States left them with a bronze medal. Wheatcroft stayed with Law until 2003, when the team was disbanded, and then began skipping her own rink, taking along Olympic teammate Diane Dezura as lead.

After the war, Myyrä won his only two Finnish javelin titles in 1917 and 1918. In 1919, Myyrä threw his only ratified world record 66.10 m, a mark that stood until 1924. Later, Myyrä would better his official world record several times, but they were never ratified for various reasons, including his eventual personal best of 68.55, thrown in Richmond, Virginia in 1925. At the 1920 Olympics, Myyrä was resting on the grass before the javelin competition when his left, non-throwing arm, was struck near the elbow by American James Lincoln’s warm-up throw. Despite that Myyrä managed to throw 60.63 during the first three rounds, enough to advance him to the evening final. On his fifth throw (his second throw of the final) Myyrä threw a new Olympic record of 65.78 m to win the gold. Four years later, at the 1924 Olympics, Myyrä successfully defended his title. After the 1924 Olympics, facing alleged financial irregularities in Finland, Myyrä emigrated to the United States and settled in San Francisco, where he invented a number of training methods that are still in use today. He is regarded as a pioneer of strength training and founder of the Finnish dominance in the javelin for many years. Myyrä’s story was told in the 2001 book Sankari vai konna by Antti Arponen and Seppo Hakuli, which translates into English as Hero or Crook. They note that he was the bank manager in Savtaipale for many years before emigrating to the USA, but after his departure it was discovered that thousands of markka had disappeared, and certain of his activities had adversely affected local businesses and families with sums in excess of 1 million markka.

But Ton Eijkenboom, although in Mexico, never raced in the marathon. In Paauw and Bijkerk’s 1996 book “Olympisch Oranje”, Eijkenboom explains that due to a large number of rowing coaches, there were insufficient quota for him as an athletics coach. It was therefore decided to enter him as a participant in the marathon. But “how my name ended up in the results, is a mystery to me”. Eijkenboom’s impact on Dutch athletics exceeded this administrative incident. He started out as a coach for the Dutch federation in 1960, and remained active as a federation or personal coach for over 45 years, specializing in the combined events. Although his fragile hips forced him to coach from a mobility scooter from a young age, he was still a very effective coach, and his athletes are said to have won over 300 medals at Dutch national championships. He was awarded for his services by the Dutch trand and field federation with a Golden cross of honor in 1991.

Capio is one of the few Italians to have won a World Championship in an Olympic class. Capio began sailing at only 5-years-old thanks to his older brother, a sailing enthusiast. His greatest international moment was in 1959 when he won the world title in the Flying Dutchman class together with the other Olympian Tullio Pizzorno. The Italian duo won easily. In his whole career, Capio was twice runner-up at the Flying Dutchman Worlds and was a 10-time Italian Champion. In the Snipe class he was the 1955 World Champion and won five domestic titles. In 5.5 metre boats he won the 1955 Mediterranean Games but never won an Olympic medal. In his three Olympic participations his best result was in 1956 in the Sharpie class with a fourth place. In 1960 at Napoli he was the favorite as the World Champion but, because of a withdrawal and one disqualification, after a protest by the Dutch crew, his medal hopes vanished. At Tokyo in 1964 he won the first race easily but struggled after that and placed 10th. After another two years of competition, Capio retired from active sports and became, for 10 years, coach of the Italian Olympic team. Capio was a mechanic at the Ansaldo company and was a skipper as his passion. In Nervi, where he was born, a promenade was named in his honor with the inscription Belvedere Mario Capio – Campione di Vela 1924-2000.",Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the Mediterranean Games (1–0–0 1955 Barcelona SAI gold: 505) Listed in Olympians Who Received the Italian Olympic Association (CONI) Gold Medal ()

In the early 1920s the family moved to Clovelly (NSW), a small beach-side Sydney suburb. She joined her elder sister Thora at the Sydney Ladies’ Swimming Club and started competing in interclub events. Thora, an Australian junior swimming champion and freestyle record holder, was selected for the Australian team for the Olympic Games in 1928 but was not sent because she was considered too young. In 1931, Clare won her first Australian 220 yd breaststroke title. One year later, she broke the world record in the 200 metre breaststroke with 3:08.6. Donations from her late father’s colleagues from the Sydney Police helped her to attend the 1932 Olympics at Los Angeles. In the heats, she was almost disqualified for wearing a swimsuit that allegedly was not according to the regulations showing too much of her shoulder. Ultimately, the charge was dismissed and she went on to win the final with an Olympic and world record of 3:06.3. After returning from Los Angeles, Clare Dennis began work in Sydney’s largest department store but continued her swimming career. In 1933, she broke the 100 breaststroke world record in 1:24.6. The next year, she became the first Australian woman to win a gold medal in the British Empire Games by winning the 200 yards breaststroke in London. In a controversial decision, she was not considered for the 1936 Australian swimming team, and she subsequently retired from competitive swimming but eventually took up professional coaching. In 1942 she married George Golding, a police detective and former Olympic track athlete. Later, she became a masseuse and owned two hairdressing salons in Sydney suburbs.

26669,Abe Lenstra,Male,27 November 1920,,, Netherlands,NED,"Although a talented speed skater and track sprinter, teenage Abe Lenstra preferred football. It proved to be a good choice, as he is still considered one of the all-time great Dutch footballers. He played with SC Heerenveen for much of his career, and is still very much identified with that club - a statue of Lenstra stands outside their stadium also which bears his name. With Heerenveen, Lenstra won the Northern Championship eight times, 1942-44 and 1946-50, but they never managed to win the overall Dutch title in that period. The fast and frequently scoring forward was reportedly offered a blank contract by Italian team Fiorentina, but Lenstra preferred to stay with Heerenveen. With the introduction of professional football in the Netherlands, Lenstra did however change teams, playing for SC Enschede from 1954 through 1960. The team narrowly lost the 1958 title, losing the tie-breaking match 0-1 in overtime. By then 40-years-old, Lenstra transferred to rival Enschedese Boys, playing with them for three more seasons before retiring. Lenstra had made his national team début in 1940, and would win 47 caps, scoring 33 times. The 1948 Olympics were the only international tournament he competed in, as the Netherlands did not qualify for the World Championships during his career. After his playing career, he was active as an amateur coach, while working for a large brewery. He suffered from a brain hemorrhage in 1977 and was forced to spend the last years of his life in a wheelchair. In 1951, Lenstra was elected Dutch Athlete of the Year - the first person bestowed with that honor.","Listed in Olympians Who Were Elected Dutch Athlete of the Year (1951, 1952)"

But as Connie Carpenter, this was 12 years after her first Olympic appearance, which came in speed skating at the 1972 Winter Olympics in Sapporo, when she was only 14-years-old. Carpenter was US national overall champion in speed skating in 1976, but injuries prevented her from competing at the 1976 Winter Olympics. She then turned primarily to cycling and won multiple titles, highlighted by a 1983 World Championship gold medal in the individual pursuit, after she had finished second in that event in 1982. On the road, Carpenter won silver in the 1977 World Championships and a bronze in the 1981 Worlds. Carpenter-Phinney won 12 U.S. cycling championships, more than any man or woman in history. Her other major cycling victories included the 1977 Tour of Fitchburg and two victories at the Coors Classic (1977, 1982). In addition she rowed for the University of California in the national collegiate championships, winning an NCAA Championship in the 1980 coxless fours. Carpenter married Davis Phinney, an American professional cyclist known for his sprint, which enabled him to probably win more races than any American cyclist ever in the professional peleton. One of their children, Taylor Phinney, became a top track cyclist, winning the individual pursuit world championship in 2009-10, and later turned to the roads, racing several times in the Tour de France, in addition to his Olympic appearances.",Wife of Davis Phinney Mother of Taylor Phinney

13735,Joey Browne,Male,22 June 1931,185.0,59, Australia,AUS,"Ian Browne took up cycling at the age of four, but did not start entering competitions until his teenage years. His first major success came at the 1953 Australian Championships, where he won the 10 mile, but his most significant victory came when he was selected to represent his country, alongside Tony Marchant, in the tandem sprint, 2,000 metres event at the 1956 Melbourne Olympics. In round one, they placed third behind South Africa and Germany, and then lost their repêchage against Czechoslovakia, thus ostensibly eliminating them from the tournament. In the third repêchage heat, however, the Soviet duo of Rostislav Vargashkin and Vladimir Leonov crashed and were hospitalized, leading the Australians to be selected to re-run the heat against Germany and the United States. This time, however, the Australians won and were never again defeated, besting South Africa in the quarter-finals, Italy in the semi-finals, and Czechoslovakia for the gold medal. After their victory, Marchant retired, but Browne continued cycling for many years, winning another national 10 mile championship in 1958. That same year, he also took the title at the British Empire and Commonwealth Games, also competing in the sprint. He won another national title, this time in the 2,000 metres tandem, in 1960 with a new partner, Geoff Smith. At the 1960 Rome Olympics, however, they were only able to place 9th. His penultimate international stop was the 1962 British Empire and Commonwealth Games, where he took home bronze in the sprint, and then won the national tandem title again in 1964 with Daryl Perkins.

The number could have been even higher, as he was present at the 1960 Olympics as an 18-year-old. He was, however, only a substitute for the Austrian sailing team there. In 1964 he started his Olympic career in the Finn class, finishing 5th, improving to silver in Mexico. He then switched from the solo vessels to two- and three-person boats. After the Tempest (1972) and the Soling (1976, together with his brother Walter), he settled for the Star class. He competed in that boat from 1980 to 1996, getting his best finish in 1980. Together with Karl Ferstl he again won a silver medal. It could have been gold, had they not been (controversially) disqualified in the third race, which they won. In his long Olympic career, Raudaschl also carried the Austrian flag four times during opening ceremonies, which is also a record. Following his last Olympic competition in 1996, he has focused on working in the family business, a sail factory. His son Florian attempted to qualify for the 2008 Olympic Finn competitions, but had to wait until 2012 to follow in his father’s footsteps.",Brother of Walter Raudaschl Father of Florian Raudaschl

66172,Fred Meadows,Male,11 November 1886,,, Canada,CAN,"By 1907 Fred Meadows was the Canadian champion in the five mile event and was gearing up to participate in athletics internationally. At the 1908 Summer Olympics he place sixth in the five mile event and also competed in the 1,500 m competition, although he failed to reach the final. Only a few months later, however, he was involved in a strange scandal involving his Olympic teammate Dave Beland of Quebec City. In late October 1908 a runner by the name of “Walter Beland” won Quebec’s annual Telegraph Road Race. Prior to the race, however, the organizers, having never heard of “Walter Beland”, had become suspicious and began to investigate. It was soon discovered that “Walter Beland” was actually Fred Meadows, and that Dave Beland had altered documents to allow Meadows to compete as if he were from the province, so that he would be eligible to run in the Quebec City versus Montreal competition. Dave knew that Meadows, a former five-mile champion, would be able to give Quebec City the upper hand. To add credibility to the scheme, Dave also claimed that Meadows, who was now in the guise of “Walter Beland”, was his brother. Meadows, as “Walter Beland”, arrived in Quebec the night before the race and Dave instructed that no one was to visit him, claiming that his “brother” usually grew nervous before a race and required rest. The organizers became even more suspicious when “Walter” failed to greet his peers from Quebec City and attempted to hide his face with a hat. “Walter” disappeared immediately after, which again heightened suspicions. By the end of the day, rumors were already spreading that “Walter Beland” had actually been Fred Meadows. After an inquiry proved this to be the case, both Meadows and Dave Beland were stripped of their amateur status, in Meadows’ case a consequence of having entered a competition under a name other than his own. He continued running as a professional and began entering marathons and long-distance races in May of 1909 and continued to compete through at least 1913.

3416,Fred Grace,Male,29 February 1884,,, Great Britain,GBR,"Fred Grace of Elton Mission BC was one of the less fancied competitors in the 1908 British Olympic boxing team. He had never won a major title and he was, by his own admission, woefully short of training. However, in the quarter-finals he scored an outstanding win over Matt Wells, who later became the British and European professional champion. In the final Grace met Fred Spiller of Gainsford AC when, after an even first round and both boxers going down in the second round, the superior skills of Grace eventually ensured a comfortable victory. Fred Grace went on to win four ABA lightweight titles between 1909 and 1920 but as boxing was illegal in Sweden in 1912 he was denied the opportunity of defending his Olympic title when at his peak. He did made a second Olympic appearance in 1920 but they then he was 36 years old and after beating a Dutchman in his first bout he lost to the eventual winner, Sammy Mosberg of America. Grace retired from his business as a heating and ventilating engineer in 1949 and while out walking one day was struck by a car, receiving injuries which proved fatal.",Listed in Olympians Who Died in Motor Vehicle Accidents (Boat/Car/Motorcycle/Train) (Died after being struck by a car while out walking.)
69262,Douglas Lowe,Male,7 August 1902,183.0,70, Great Britain,GBR,"Douglas Lowe was the first man to retain an Olympic 800 metres title and he surprisingly won his first Olympic gold medal in 1924, before he had won an AAA title. At Highgate School, Lowe won the Public Schools half-mile in 1920 and while at Pembroke College, Cambridge, he won a blue for soccer and athletics. He finished third in the 880 yards against Oxford in 1921 bef0ore winning the event for the next three years and in 1924 he also won the mile. Despite reaching the 880 yards final at the 1922 and 1923 AAA Championships, Lowe failed both times to finish in the first three; but in 1924 he was a close second to Henry Stallard. Lowe was not, therefore, Britain’s first-string for the 800 metres at the Paris Olympics and was a surprise winner in 1:52.4 seconds, which beat the British record set by Albert Hill in the previous Olympic final. He came close to winning a second medal when he finished fourth in the 1,500 metres. He continued to show impressive form in the years between the 1924 and 1928 Olympics and in 1926, after setting a world record for 600 years, he was narrowly defeated over 880 yards by the German Otto Peltzer at the AAA Championships. Peltzer set a new world record of 1:51.6 seconds and Lowe was credited with an estimated 1:52.0 seconds, which was also inside the old world record. In 1927 Lowe finally won his first AAA title; in fact, he won three. He finished first in the 440 yards and 880 yards and was an Achilles Club team that won the 4×440 yards relay. He also showed a surprising turn of speed as a member of the Achilles team which was third in the 4×110 yards relay. He retained both his 440 yards and 880 yards AAA titles in 1928 and then won his second Olympic gold medal where he devastated a world class field with a new Olympic record of 1:51.8 seconds. Later in the Amsterdam Games, he ran a 47.6 second leg on the 4×400 metre relay team that set a new British record of 3:16.4 seconds to finish fifth place. Lowe ran two more magnificent races before he retired at the end of the 1928 season. An 880 yards relay leg, estimated at 1:51.0 seconds, in the British Empire vs. USA match was probably the fastest performance of his entire career. He followed that with a British record of 1:51.2 seconds for 800 metres. Douglas Lowe was Called to the Bar of the Inner Temple in 1928, became a bencher in 1957 and took silk in 1964. He was deputy chairman of Warwick quarter sessions, Recorder of Lincoln and a Recorder of the Crown Court. Despite his busy legal career, Lowe found time to serve as Honorary Secretary of the amateur Athletic Association from 1931 to 1938. Personal Bests: 440y – 48.8 (1927); 800 – 1:51.2 (1928); 1500 – 3:57.0 (1924); Mile – 4:21.0 (1925).",

Roberts achieved the best performance of his career when he ran 46.8 in the 400 metres at the 1936 Berlin Olympics, finishing in fourth place only one metre behind the winner. In the relay final, Roberts’ estimated 46.4 was the fastest of all the stages and made a major contribution to Britain’s victory. In post-Olympic meetings, Roberts beat the American Olympics 400 metres champion Archie Williams over the first leg of the 4×440 yard relay in the British Empire vs. USA match, and five days later he met the Olympic 800 metre champion John Woodruff over 400 metres in Oslo. Woodruff set a career best of 46.8 and Roberts, in second place with 47.1 had only ever run faster in the Berlin final. Roberts won the AAA title in 1937 and was the British Empire champion in 1938. He also won a silver medal in the 1938 British Empire Games 4×440 yards relay (with Brian MacCabe, Frank Handley, and the non-Olympian Henry Pack) and finished sixth in the 220 yards. Although he did not compete in 1939, he made a successful comeback after the war. In 1946, he finished second to the Jamaican Arthur Wint at the AAA Championships, then won the international against France, and closed the season with a silver medal in the relay (with Derek Pugh and the non-Olympians Ronald Ede and Bernard Elliot) and fifth place in the individual 400 metres at the European Championships in Oslo. After a quiet 1947 season, Roberts, in third place, was the first Briton home at the 1948 AAA Championships and was elected captain of the British team for the Olympic Games. But the successes of Berlin were not to be repeated. The 36-year-old Roberts was eliminated in the second round of the individual 400 metres and despite a fine leg in the relay heats he narrowly failed to take Britain through to the final.

18753,Alastair Denniston,Male,1 December 1881,,, Great Britain,GBR,"Alastair Denniston excelled in school in classics, languages, and mathematics. He studied language and literature at Bonn University and the University of Paris, and became fluent in German, and taught languages at Merchiston Castle, the Edinburgh public school, and at the pre-Dartmouth Naval Preparatory School, Osborne, on the Isle of Wight. While there he was recruited into the Admiralty at the outbreak of World War I. His ability in German helped him find his way into the world of cryptography and cryptanalysis, and he was eventually awarded a CBE in 1933 and a CMG in 1941 for his work in those fields. In November 1914 he began working in Room 40, the naval cryptanalysis section. He continued to work in secret intelligence for the British military thru May 1945, serving Britain well during two World Wars. He was instrumental in the establishment, growth, and development of the Government Code and Cipher School in 1919, and the UK Government Communication Headquarters (GCHQ) in 1941, and he worked in the diplomatic arm of that group from 1942 to 1945. Serving at Bletchley Park, he was responsible for heading the secret Ultra project, that broke enemy codes, including the famed German coding machine Enigma. During the 2nd World War, Denniston worked closely with William Friedman, head of American cryptology, and it started a friendship that lasted until Denniston’s death in 1961. Friedman wrote to his daughter on her father’s death, “Your father was a great man and will remain in the debt of all English speaking people for a long time, if not for ever. That so few of them should know what he did towards the achievement of victory in WWI and II is the sad part of the untold story of his life and of his great contribution to that victory.”",

After a successful début in athletics in 1923, she enrolled in Nikaido Gymnastics School the following year. Later that year, she won the triple jump and javelin throw with unofficial record marks. After graduating Hitomi worked as a gymnastics teacher in Kyoto and in Taiwan, but then returned to Nikaido Gymnastics School, which was to become the Japan Women’s Physical Education College. She competed in the Meiji Jingu championships, winning both the 50 metre dash and the triple jump in two consecutive years, setting an unofficial world record of 11.62 in the triple jump. In 1926, she joined the Sports Division of the Osaka Mainichi Shimbun newspaper. In the following years she won nation-wide competitions in such different events as 100 metres, triple jump, baseball throw, and shot put, setting a Japanese record in the latter. In 1926, she was the only Japanese person to take part in the 2nd Women’s World Games in Göteberg, where she won the long jump with a world record of 5.50. She also won the standing long jump, placed second in the discus throw, and third in the 100 yard run and competed in the 60 and 250 metre runs. As a result, she not only received the Honorary Award of the Fédération Sportive Féminine Internationale (FSFI) but also earned valuable experiences regarding Western training techniques. Hitomi continued to dominate women’s athletics in Japan, tying the world record in the 100 with 12.4. In October 1927 she took her first titles at the Japan Athletics Championships, in the 50 and 100 metres. In 1928, she set an unofficial world record of 59.0 for 400 metres. At the next national championships, she improved the 100 world record to 12.2 and set another one in the long jump with 5.98. At the AAA Women’s Championships in London, she clocked 25.8 in the 200, yet another world record. At the 1928 Amsterdam Olympics Hitomi was the first Japanese female athlete to compete and her silver medal in the 800 made her the first Japanese female Olympic medalist. After another defeat at home in the 100 she retired, but returned in the spring of 1929 and continued to set Japanese records in various events and even a world record of 24.7 in the 200. At the end of 1929, she successfully took part in several international meetings while a German team toured the Far East. At the next Japanese Athletics Championships, she captured victories in the 200, long jump, and 4x100 relay, setting six Japanese records during the event. In 1930 a fundraiser at girls’ schools allowed six athletes, including Hitomi, to represent Japan at the 3rd International Women’s Games at Praha. She took gold in the long jump, silver in the triathlon, and bronze in the 60 metres and javelin throw. With 13 individual points, she came in second in the overall individual standings. While still in Europe, the Japanese team and Hitomi took part in various meetings against European countries although she was sick and suffered from a high fever. Back in Japan, she immediately returned to work but had to be hospitalized for pleurisy in the Osaka Imperial University Hospital in March 1931. There, she eventually died from pneumonia exactly three years after winning the silver medal in Amsterdam. During her short career, Hitomi set four official world records in three different events, two unofficial world records in events that were not official at the time (400, triple jump) and another four in events that are no longer on the international schedule (50 and 60 metres, standing long jump, triathlon). That is 10 world records altogether, in nine different events. All of her medals and trophies had been donated during World War II for metal recovery. Only the Olympic silver medal survived but was not discovered until 2000.

He worked for Ullstein, a publishing company, but moved to the United States in 1913, ending up in New York City with only about 50 words of English in his vocabulary. Despite this, he found work quickly and, by 1920, was able to open up his own portrait studio, although he continued to hold another job as an engraver. When Harper’s Bazaar began giving him a monthly space in their magazine in 1921, however, he dropped this second job to focus on celebrity portrait photography. He was sent to Europe in 1926 and Hollywood in 1929 to capture the famous faces of the era, garnering worldwide recognition for his efforts. In 1931, while working for Ladies’ Home Journal, he produced the first natural color commercial photograph to appear in an American magazine. His career also took him into the realm of advertisements, and he produced many works in this field as well. Muray quickly became a part of American society on a personal level as well, and even served as a flight lieutenant in the Civil Air Patrol during World War II. An avid fencer, he was the United States sabre champion in 1927 and competed in this discipline at the 1928 and 1932 Summer Olympics. In 1928 he was eliminated in the opening round of both the individual and team events, but in 1932 he finished fourth in the team event. Muray was active in the sport after his competitive career ended, serving as a referee at the 1956 and 1960 Olympic Games. On 9 February 1961 he was practicing fencing at the New York Athletic Club when he collapsed with a heart attack. A fellow fencer, Barry Pariser, then a medical resident, tried to revive him, but when he was unable to do so, he opened his chest with a penknife and did open heart massage for 40 minutes while Muray was being taken to the hospital. Muray survived and was able to continue fencing and again refereed at the 1964 Olympics. In November 1965 he again collapsed during a match in New York, and this time no miracle occurred and he succumbed to a heart attack.",

Two similar versions of this painting exist, but one of them is said to have been created not before 1937. Graafland died in 1940 after an operation, which had progressively weakened him rapidly. He was appointed Knight of the Order of Orange-Nassau. Many of his works were lost in 1945 during an Allied bombing raid.",Listed in Olympian Members of the Nobility (Jonkheer)

But in his first two seasons with the Islanders, Salo did not see much ice, playing in only 16 games, so Salo played most of those seasons with the Islanders’ International Hockey League (IHL) affiliate Denver Grizzlies (who became the Utah Grizzlies in 1995). With the Grizzlies, Salo helped them win the Turner Cup as league champions in 1995 and 1996, was awarded the James Gatschene Memorial Trophy as league MVP, the James Norris Memorial Trophy as the goalie with the fewest goals against and the Gary F. Longman Memorial Trophy as the 1995 rookie-of-the-year, and the N. R. “Bud” Poile Trophy as the 1996 playoff MVP. He was also selected to the IHL First All-Star Team in 1995. Starting in the 1996-97 season, Salo became the Islanders’ starting goalie until 1999, when he was traded to the Edmonton Oilers. He was the top Oilers goalie for 5½ seasons until the lockout cancelled 2004-05 season and was selected to the NHL All-Star Game in 2000 and 2002. During the 2004-05 lockout season, Salo played with MoDo Hockey. After that season, Salo decided not to return to the NHL, citing chronic hip pains, and instead played two years with Frölunda HC until his retirement in 2007 due to his hip problems. Internationally Salo was the top Swedish goalie for nearly 10 years. He competed at three Olympic Winter Games (1994-02), eight World Championships (1994 and 1997-03), and at the 1996 and 2004 World Cups. He won a 1994 Olympic gold, was 1998 World Champion, won silvers at the 1997 and 2003 World Championships and bronzes at the 1994, 1999, 2001 and 2002 World Championships. He was named as the best goalie at the 1997, 1998 and 1999 World Championships and was selected to the World Championships All-Star Team the same years. After finishing his sporting career, Salo worked as an ice hockey coach. From 2007-09 he was head coach of Kungälvs IK and from 2009-10 was head coach of IK Oskarshamn. In 2010 he became general manager and assistant coach of Leksands IF. He was awarded the Stora Grabbars Märke (Big Boys’ Badge) #158 in ice hockey.","Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the World Ice Hockey Championships (1–2–4 1994 Bolzano, Canazei and Milano bronze; 1997 Helsinki, Turku and Tampere silver; 1998 Zürich and Basel gold; 1999 Oslo, Lillehammer and Hamar bronze; 2001 Köln, Hannover and Nürnberg bronze; 2002 Göteborg, Karlstad and Jönköping bronze; 2003 Helsinki, Tampere, and Turku silver)"

Jo herself was a painter and art teacher. The symbolic power of the design honored the rubble women and female forest workers, who rebuilt the cities and forests destroyed by men after World War II. Richard Martin Werner died shortly after the first coins with the image of his wife were minted. Overall, more than 2 billion pieces were coined between 1949 and 2002. The coin was considered the most popular among former German Marks (DM) coins. It was also the only coin of the Federal Republic of Germany with a woman on the back side. Werner studied in Frankfurt am Main at the Städel School and the Municipal School for Applied Arts under Richard Scheibe, amongst others. Werner produced several standing female nudes as well as portraits in bronze, marble or stone. He produced numerous female nudes in simple large forms as well as portraits. After World War II, he joined the Darmstadt Secession and taught sculpture at a vocational school. His much smaller than life-sized bronze sculpture Läuferin am Start (Female runner starting) received an Honorable Mention at the 1936 Art Competitions in Berlin within the category Sculpturing, Statues. The work came to Frankfurt in 1938 and stood in front of today’s Commerzbank Arena on a granite pedestal since then. Track and field athlete Emmi Haux (1904-?) is said to have been the model for the sculpture. In the 1920s, Haux was multiple German champion in various athletics disciplines and in 1930 participated in the Women’s World Games.",

66226,Eric Robertson,Male,12 September 1892,,, Great Britain,GBR,"Eric Robertson is not always listed as a British international, because of the unusual circumstances surrounding his 1920 Olympic participation in the marathon. During World War I, Robertson was wounded in action on the first day of the Battle of the Somme, receiving a gun shot wound to his right leg and in 1917 he was eventually discharged and returned home to Newfoundland. In 1920 he took up a position with the London clothing store Fortnum and Brown. Among his workmates were some member of Polytechnic Harriers and through them Robertson developed an interest in running, although he had no competitive record of note. Robertson elected to travel to Antwerp to watch the Olympics, and met up there with his Polytechnic teammates, who were in Antwerp as part of the British team. Canada was affiliated with Newfoundland at the time, although it was not integrated into the Dominion until 1949. Canada had entered four marathon runners, while Britain entered only three. His teammates persuaded the British team manager to offer the vacant fourth spot on the British team to Robertson, who wore the number that had been allocated to the fourth member of the British team, even though Robertson was a Newfoundland national. His lack of experience and ability showed as he finished in last place, 35 minutes behind the next-to-last finisher, and almost one and a half hours behind the winner. For his Olympic participation, he was presented a silver medal by the Polytechnic Sports Club. Robertson returned to Newfoundland in 1921 and went on to become a renowned athletics judge, organizer, official and trainer. He holds the distinction of being the first Newfoundland born and bred athlete to compete at the Olympic Games, albeit for Great Britain, and in unusual circumstances.

He started in football with the teams Swift and Blauw Wit, before joining Ajax Amsterdam in 1914, but it took him another three years to become a regular. Unfortunately, he missed the decisive games during Ajax’ first two championship seasons in 1918 and 1919. During his time with Ajax he earned his first 10 caps from 1920-22. De Natris played the first three matches of the Olympic tournament in 1920, but was then in the center of a mutiny on the Dutch football team. A group of players refused to return to their primitive cabins on the naval ship Hollandia, where the Dutch athletes were accommodated. Four “ringleaders” were to be sent home including Jan de Natris, but the team threatened to go on strike for the pending game against Spain. To avoid cancellation of the bronze medal game the four players were pardoned but De Natris and Jaap Bulder were not considered. After 1922 De Natris played one season each for De Spartaan and again for Blauw Wit, before he returned to Ajax in 1925. After another two seasons with Ajax he joined Vitesse Arnhem, where he played three seasons. Subsequently, he returned to Ajax again for his last season, finishing his active career in 1929. Internationally, he won another 13 caps for a total of 23 including another four in the Olympic tournament at Paris in 1924. The last one also came in 1924 during his time with Vitesse Arnhem. For the national team he scored five goals. Jan de Natris was also an excellent sprinter with a personal best of 11.1 sec over 100 m, and was one of the first Dutch players to advocate for a professional football league. His various changes of clubs during his active career nourished speculations about payments. In 1953, he acted briefly as a technical advisor to the break-away Dutch Professional Football Association (NBVB), before it was merged with the Dutch football federation. De Natris worked as a travelling salesman for plumbing technology and later worked in his wife’s tobacco shop in Amsterdam.",

Caproni was born and raised in Livorno, until his family moved to Genova. There, he also studied violin, and composition, at the Giuseppe Verdi Institute of Music. From composition he moved into poetry, and gave up his musical ambitions at the age of 18. He then studied literature and wrote his first poems. In 1933-34, he saw military service in San Remo, before moving to Roma. During World War II, he was called to arms, but his experiences in the war made him a resistance fighter. After the war, Caproni went to Roma where he worked for many years as a primary school teacher. His later poetry was influenced by the hardship of the war. He never became part of the literary circles in Roma, but is considered one of the greatest Italian poets of the 20th century. Two of his works were submitted for the 1948 art competitions: Il giuoco del Pallone (The game of football) is a short story originally published in pieces in various magazines between 1947 and 1948.

37230,Peter Brandt,Male,2 July 1931,,, Great Britain,GBR,"Peter Brandt was a banker by profession, and was the ninth generation of a 17th century Polish/German family of merchants who eventually came to London in 1805 and shortly afterwards established the bank of Wm. Brandt’s Sons & Company. Brandt started working in the company in 1954, having been educated at Eton College and Trinity College, Cambridge. It was after completing his two year’s National Service in the Royal Navy that he joined the family business and became managing director in 1966. He remained with them until 1972 when they were taken over by National and Grindlays bank, after more than 160 years trading. At Cambridge, Brandt rowed for First and Third Trinity Boat Club and specialised in double sculling. He was a semi-finalist in the double sculls at Henley in 1952 with John MacMillan and reached the final of the Magdalene Pairs at Cambridge the following year. Brandt went to the Helsinki Olympics in 1952 and partnered MacMillan. They nearly missed out on selection, however, after finishing second in the Olympic trial at Henley to Dickie Burnell and Pat Bradley of Leander, but the two crews’ oars were overlapping at the finish. After the Trinity men put in an objection the race was re-run 10 days later, which Brandt and MacMillan won by four lengths. Although he never won a rowing Blue, Brandt was on the fringe of the 1954 Cambridge Boat Race crew but a strained arm forced him to miss a crucial part of the season. Despite not winning a Blue, he was nominated for the Cambridge University Boat Club presidency in 1953. In his retirement, Brandt enjoyed sailing, steam engines, wild fowl, and collected water colours by English artists. Shortly before his death, Brandt published the book Wm. Brandt’s Sons & Co: The Story of a Family Trading Company.",

His parents were both devout Seventh-Day Adventists and members of the “Original 8” as Black pioneers of their faith community in their adopted home of Toronto. They both worked at local hospitals, his mother as a nurse at Mount Sinai and his father as a chef at Wellesley. Bryan Saunders attended Georges Vanier Secondary School in North York where he became a keen track competitor. He then accepted scholarships to attend college in the United States from 1973 to 1974 in North Platte, Nebraska and at Bishop State Community College in Alabama, during which time he took a break from competition due to religious reasons. Returning to competition by 1975, he regained notice in the Canadian athletics scene by running a 400 metres in 45.9 at a college track meet in America, which made him a strong prospect for the 1976 Olympic team. He was a member of the Canadian 4×400 metres relay team at the 1975 Pan American Games in Mexico (alongside Glenn Bogue, Don Domansky, and Ron Jackson) and 1975 Summer Universiade in Italy, which won a pair of bronze medals. Saunders also competed in the 400 metres at the 1975 Pan American Games, finishing sixth. At the 1976 Olympics in Montreal, Saunders competed in the 400 metres and as a member of the 4×400 metres team, recording a Canadian record with his teammates Ian Seale, Don Domansky, and Leighton Hope with a time of 3:02.64 in the latter and narrowly missing out on the bronze medal. He also competed in both events eight years later at the Olympic Games in Los Angeles, and also scored a fifth place finish in the 400 metres at the 1979 Pan American Games. Following his athletics career, Saunders continued to reside in the Toronto area until his death in 2022 at the age of 69.

Her 391 total that year in the kneeling position was a new world record – for men or women – the first time any woman had set an internationally recognized world record above the men’s mark – in any sport. Margaret Thompson Murdock won several titles at the 1970 World Championships in 300 metre free rifle standing, the women’s standard rifle 3x20 event with an individual world record, helping the US team win that event with another world record, and won further team golds in the 300 metre free rifle 3x40 and 300 metre free rifle standing events. At the 1973 Championships of the Americas in Mexico City, Murdock won team golds in the 300 m free rifle 3x40 and the 50 m free rifle 3x40, helping the team set four world records. Murdock won further World Championships in 1974 in the women’s 50 m standard rifle prone, tying the world record, and helping the team win that title; and winning team titles in 50 m free rifle 3x40 and 50 m free rifle standing. At the 1975 Pan American Games she won the 50 m free rifle 3x40 event, helped the USA win the 50 meter free rifle 3x40 and 50 meter free rifle prone team events, and set another open individual world record in the 50m free rifle standing event At the 1976 Olympics Murdock tied for first place with Lanny Bassham in the smallbore, three position event, but on the examination of the targets, Bassham was awarded first place and Murdock was relegated to the silver medal. Bassham gallantly asked Margaret Murdock to share the victory platform with him as the flag was raised and the anthem played – and rightly so. Margaret Murdock graduated from Kansas State in 1965 and Washburn University School of Nursing in 1977. She later became a nurse anaesthetist, in addition to being a competitive shooter, housewife, and mother.","Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the Summer Pan American Games (5–0–0 1967 Winnipeg SHO gold: small-bore rifle 3 positions and small-bore rifle 3 positions team (competed as Margaret Thompson); 1975 Ciudad de México SHO gold: small-bore rifle 3 positions, small-bore rifle 3 positions team, and small-bore rifle prone team (competed as Margaret Murdock)) Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the World Shooting Championships (10–5–1 1966 Wiesbaden gold: 50 m small-bore rifle 3 positions, silver: 50 m small-bore rifle prone and 50 m small-bore rifle prone team (competed as Margaret Thompson); 1970 Phoenix gold: 300 m free rifle standing, 50 m small-bore rifle 3 positions, 300 m free rifle 3 positions team, 300 m free rifle standing team, and 50 m small-bore rifle 3 positions team, silver: 300 m free rifle kneeling team; 1974 Bern/Thun gold: 50 m small-bore rifle prone, 50 m small-bore rifle 3 positions team, 50 m small-bore rifle standing team, and 50 m small-bore rifle prone team, silver: 50 m small-bore rifle kneeling team and 50 m small-bore rifle prone team, bronze: 50 m small-bore rifle 3 positions)"

922714,William Crabbie,Male,1 February 1893,,, Great Britain,GBR,"William Monteith Crabbie came from a wealthy family. His grandfather John Crabbie was the founder of the Edinburgh drinks company that bears his name, and Crabbie’s alcoholic ginger beer is one of the best-known drink brands in Britain and worldwide. When he died in 1891, John Crabbie left the 2020 equivalent of £43 million. William, like his father before him, would go on to work for the family company. William Crabbie was the youngest of three sons of George Crabbie, and attended Edinburgh Academy. He was a fine rugby player but, unlike his two older siblings, John and George, he did not go on to play for Scotland. He was, however, vice-captain of the Edinburgh Academy XV that won the Scottish Schools Rugby Championship in 1911, and went on to play senior rugby for Edinburgh Academicals. His preferred sport, however, was athletics and he won the 880 yards and mile at the Edinburgh Academy Championship in 1910 to carry off the Burma Cup. He retained it in 1911 and the follow year was selected for the 1,500 metres at the Stockholm Olympics. Crabbie surprisingly never won the Scottish One Mile Championship, but was third in 1913 and second the following year. During World War I, Crabbie served as a lieutenant in the Royal Field Artillery and then, after its formation, the Royal Air Force (RAF). He won British and Victory Medals, and the 1915 Star, before retiring from service in 1923. Crabbie was attached to the Military Flying Service in the early part of the War and in July 1915 was reported missing in France. A month later, his family received notification that he was a prisoner-of-war in Germany. He returned to Scotland in November 1918. Crabbie, who obtained his Aviator’s Certificate from the Royal Aero Club in 1929, was to serve the Scottish Amateur Athletic Association (SAAA) as an honorary president, and in 1953, donated the Coronation Cup to the SAAA in honour of the Coronation of HM Queen Elizabeth II. It was to become an annual award to the outstanding Scottish athlete of the year, and notable winners included Jim Alder, Ian Stewart, Liz McColgan, Yvonne Murray, and Allan Wells, who won it six times in succession between 1978-83.",

In a special Czechoslovakian NHL Entry Draft in 1981, Hlinka was chosen by the Winnipeg Jets but was traded to the Vancouver Canucks and played the 1981-82 and 1982-83 seasons in North America with the Canucks. Returning to Europe he then played two seasons in Switzerland with EV Zug before retiring due to back problems, although it was a transient retirement. He came back in 1986-87 to serve as a player-coach with Litvinov. Internationally, Hlinka played in the 1972 and 1976 Olympics, winning Olympic silver in 1972. He also played on 11 World Championships teams for Czechoslovakia from 1970-81, missing only the 1980 Worlds, and winning a medal at each participation. He won World golds in 1972, 1976 and 1977, silvers in 1971, 1974-75, and 1978-79, and bronzes in 1970, 1973, and 1981. In addition he helped Czechoslovakia to a runner-up finish at the 1976 Canada Cup. In all he was capped 256 times for Czechoslovakia, scoring 132 international goals. After his playing career ended, Hlinka became a coach, started with his CHZ Litvínov club, coming back as a player in 1986-87 to help the team as a player-coach. At the club level he later coached EHC Freiburg in Germany from 1989-90, Spartak Omsk in Russia in 2002-04, and in 2000-01 he spent one season as coach of the Pittsburgh Penguins in the NHL, only the second European to be a head coach in the NHL.

Over the next few years she became one of the most consistent performers in the world and was third at the 2001 and 2002 World Championships and won both the European Championships and World Cup Final in 2003. She also helped Great Britain win the team event at the World Championships in 2001, 2003 and 2004. These performances made her a strong medal contender for the Athens Olympics but she struggled badly in the early stages of the event. Still only 14th after four of the five events, Harland produced a cross-country run that was nearly half a minute faster than anyone else and earned herself an Olympic bronze medal in the process. She added silver medals in both the team and relay events at the 2006 World Championships but failed to gain qualification for the Beijing Olympics and retired at the end of the 2008 season.

He competed in modern pentathlon at three Olympics, the Pan American Games of 1951 and 1955, and was the 1947 South American Champion in modern pentathlon. But he is best known for his military and political career. Floody studied at the Military Academy of Bernardo O’Higgins, beginning in 1941, and would eventually become the leader of that institution. His training was as a cavalry officer and in 1964 he spent time at Fort Knox in the US, at a course for armored officers. In September 1973 he supported the military coup d’état of Augusto Pinochet in Chile and was then promoted to brigadier general. After Pinochet established his dictatorship, Floody was placed in charge of what human rights groups termed “Operation Comb,” which was in charge of capturing and eliminating “armed extremists.” In 1978 it was discovered by another high ranked officer that Floody was said to have been deeply involved in crimes against humanity during Pinochet’s dictatorship, but he was never charged, and he continued his rise in the Chilean military and politics. In 1974 Floody was appointed mayor of the Bío Bío Region in Chile and shortly thereafter was made commander of the Third Army Division, based on Concepción. He was then sent to Washington as head of the Chilean Military Mission. On his return in 1977 he was promoted to major general, and was appointed mayor of the Magallanes Region and Chilean Antárctica. During his tenure in that region, he faced a difficult situation with a potential border war with Argentina over the islands of the Beagle Channel. In 1979 Floody was appointed director of the Chilean Department of Sport. He was named the Chilean Ambassador to Israel in 1983, a position he held until 1987.",

After World War II, Bonicco continued with success, and in 1947 was Italian giant slalom champion, and was a regular member of the Italian national team.

Five years later his boxing career was over following an accident at work. Packer was a former Chatham dockyard apprentice whose boxing career started at the Dartford Amateur Boxing Club. A southpaw bantamweight, he was told at the age of 17 he should never box again, unless he wanted to live with a permanently damaged hand. After several operations and a two-year wait, however, he was not only back in the ring, but was the ABA bantamweight champion. Packer won the first of his back-to-back ABA titles in 1963, and shortly afterwards was selected for the England team to go to the European Amateur Championships at Moskva. After winning his second ABA title in 1964, Packer went to the Tokyo Olympics, but lost on a split decision to local favourite Takao Sakurai, who went on to win the gold medal. It was a decision that haunted Packer emotionally for much of his career. After the Olympics, Packer turned professional and won 14 of 15 bouts, his only defeat being on a TKO after suffering a cut eye against South African Winston Van Guylenburg at the Shoreditch Town Hall. Due to a lack of quality bantamweights, Packer stepped up to featherweight to fight Glasgow’s Bobby Fisher in November 1968. That would turn out to be Packer’s last fight. With an exciting future ahead of him, with fights against the Spanish European bantamweight champion Ben Ali and Mexico’s world number one, Ruben Olivares, scheduled, Packer’s world crumbled in December 1968. While working as a welder on the North Sea Gas pipeline he fell into a trench and did serious damage to his leg. Despite attempts to get back into the ring, the damaged leg prevented him from continuing with his boxing career. Although he continued working as a welder, Packer had received substantial compensation following the accident but suffered with health issues including mental health issues and heart bypass surgery. In 2008, he was diagnosed with dementia.",

Leibbrandt attended Grey College at Bloemfontein from 1924-30. As a boxer, he fought at the 1936 Olympics after winning a bronze medal as a light-heavyweight at the 1934 British Empire Games. He turned professional in early 1937 and in July 1937 became South African heavyweight champion. In June 1937 Leibbrant defeated Tiny de Swardt in 13 seconds (some say 11 seconds), considered the shortest fight in South African boxing history. He fought two bouts in 1949, after the war. During World War II, Leibbrant worked as a Nazi spy and served in the Germany Army. Leibbrandt formed the Nasionaal Sosialistiese Rebelle, a rebel organization in South Africa. In December 1942 he was captured and arrested in Pretoria, and in March 1943 was sentenced to death for high treason. The sentence was eventually commuted that year to life imprisonment by General Jan Smuts, who knew the Leibbrandt family. In 1948, Daniel François Malan, leader of the newly victorious National Party, released Leibbrandt in an amnesty of war criminals. Leibbrandt left the prison and was greeted as a folk hero by many South African people. Later in his life Leibbrandt remained politically active, starting the Anti-Kommunistiese Beskermingsfront (Anti-Communist Protection Front) in 1962. He also produced a series of pamphlets entitled Ontwaak Suid-Afrika (Wake up South Africa).",Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the British Empire/Commonwealth Games (0–0–1 1934 London BOX bronze: light-heavyweight -175 lb (79.38 kg))

He also found time to serve the constituency of Chertsey in Surrey as a Conservative Member of Parliament (MP) for nine years between 1922-31. The Baronetcy was conferred upon him in 1929. Richardson was the son of John Wigham Richardson, founder of a firm of shipbuilders that became part of the famous Swan, Hunter, Wigham Richardson company, of which Sir Philip was chairman for many years. Swan Hunter, as they became better known, built some famous British ships at the turn of the 20th century, including RMS Mauretania, which held the Blue Riband for the fastest crossing of the Atlantic. Richardson was educated at Rugby School and King’s College, Cambridge. At school he was a keen footballer and athlete, and won the school steeplechase championship. He also took up rifle shooting during his time at Rugby and, after going to Cambridge, was in the University Match Rifle team in 1884-86. He reached the Queen’s (later King’s) Prize for the first time in 1886 when he was a member of the Cambridge University Volunteer Force, and appeared in the final ten times between then and 1924. Although he never won the title, he coached his former chauffer Captain E. W. H. Brookes to win the title in 1949. At the time of his death, Richardson was regarded as the “Father” of the Bisley Meeting. In addition to his King’s Prize appearances, Richardson, a former chairman of the National Rifle Association, made a total of 26 appearances for England in both the National Trophy and MacKinnon Cup matches between 1887-1920 and captained both teams several times. He appeared at two Olympics, and in 1908 was a member of the Military Rifle team that won a silver medal. Richardson’s talents were put to good use during World War I when he trained snipers in the use of telescopic sights and generally raised the standard of musketry in the British Army. His services were recognised with the award of an OBE in 1919. He also received the Volunteer Officers’ Decoration (VD), and was knighted in 1921.","Listed in Olympian Members of the Nobility (Sir, 1st Baronet Richardson of Weybridge) Listed in Olympians Who Were Members of National Legislatures (Member of the UK House of Commons 1922–1931 (Conservative))"

Pardoe nearly added a British Empire Games title to his record in 1930, but lost to the South African Jacob Smith in the final. At the Los Angeles Olympics two years later, Pardoe reached the semi-final and then gave his American opponent Lou Salica a walk-over in the bronze medal contest. Pardoe won his fifth ABA title in 1933 but came close to not taking part following the death of his brother shortly before the Championships. During his amateur days Pardoe was a farmer at Church End, Birmingham. He turned professional in 1933, and in a four-year career showed early promise, winning nine of his first 11 contests, including the Southern Area flyweight title against the experienced Bert Kelly. However, it all then went wrong for Pardoe, and he won just one of his remaining 15 contests, to end with a career record 10-15-1.

This was mainly due to his tremendous ability as a road sprinter, unmatched in the peloton at the time. Only the Grand Prix des Nations (a time trial) and the Bordeaux-Paris are missing from his list of victories in classics. Van Looy’s lack of strength as a time trialist was his greatest weakness and cost him in the grand tours. He was not a great climber, though he was better than average. Van Looy also won 11 six-day races, nine of them with Peter Post. Van Looy is one of only three riders to have won all five monument races, the best known of the one-day classics, along with Merckx and Roger De Vlaeminck. Van Looy was twice a winner at the World Championship road race, winning in 1960-61. In the grand tours, he won the points classification at the 1963 Tour de France and the 1959 and 1965 Vuelta a España, and the mountains classification at the 1960 Giro d’Italia.

The Diana Golden Opportunities Fund was established to support and encourage junior athletes with disabilities. Golden was given the Flo Hyman Memorial Award in 1991 by the Women’s Sports Foundation.

The painter, graphic artist and impressionist was the first woman who dared to draw a self-portrait with a female nude. She had her best period between the two world wars and in 1929 was awarded the title of Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire, as the first woman since the 18th century to be introduced into the Royal Academy. She became best known for her portraits of dancers, actors and circus actors in the early 20th century. Laura and Harold had an influential circle of friends including George Bernard Shaw, T E Lawrence and Augustus John. Her portrait of Shaw was one of her finest works. After World War II Knight became the official war artist of the Nuremberg trials on the leadership of the Third Reich. She received an “Honorable Mention” in the Arts Competitions at London in 1948 for her Boxing Sketch in the engraving and etchings category, while at Amsterdam in 1928 she won a silver medal for the work Boxers. Canadian Joe Shears (St. James) was the model for her paintings of boxers. She was commissioned by the Canadian War Memorials Fund in 1916 to paint the physical training of the troops at Witley Camp near Godalming in Surrey, south west of London. Shears was army champion at the time. The painting has been exhibited under various titles and is best known as Boxing in Camp (The Light-Heavyweights). The painting in oil on canvas measures 58 x 71cm. Also an oil on canvas painting is Between Rounds from about 1920, submitted in 1932. The work may also be identical to the one that was entered as Repos (Recreational Break) in 1928. One version of Paddock at Ascot (oil on canvas, 51 x 64 cm) is said to have been painted around 1935. A painting entitled Romany Belles is in the Aberdeen Art Gallery & Museum. The work depicted under this title in the 1948 catalog, however, is traded on the art market as Gypsies at Epsom (oil on canvas, 76.2 x 63.5 cm). Epsom is a 35.5 x 51 cm watercolor with pencil. Again, there is another work known with this title. Especially in the 1930s, Laura Knight created numerous sketches, drawings and individual watercolors on the subject of boxing, which were probably exhibited collectively as Boxer or Boxing.

After attending boarding school, Frank was educated at Owen’s School, Islington, before going to Corpus Christi, Cambridge from where he graduated as a “Wrangler”, the name given to students who obtained their first-class honours in the third year of their undergraduate degree in mathematics at Cambridge. At University, Sandon was a swimming Half-Blue in 1911 and 1912, winning the 440 yards freestyle title in the first of those years. He finished second in both the Southern area trial and the final trial at Southport for the 1912 Olympics, but not in his preferred quarter-mile freestyle; instead he entered for the backstroke. At Stockholm, Sandon reached the 100 metres back semi-final, finishing fourth. After University, Sandon got a job as a clerk at the Home Office, but left in 1919 as it was not challenging enough for him. He decided that his vocation was in teaching, and he trained at the department of training for teachers at Oxford University. He then obtained teaching posts in Sheffield, and then within the London area at Greenwich, Highgate and West Ham, before being appointed headmaster of the Plymouth Corporation Grammar school in 1929. It closed in 1937 when Sandon became a secondary school teacher in the area. He remained in the Plymouth area until 1941 when he was offered the headmaster’s position of a county co-educational grammar school (now known as a secondary school) at Millom in Cumbria. Sandon published several books, including the 1920 publication “Every-Day Mathematics”. His younger brother Harold also swam for the Amateur Swimming Club.",

He is presumed to have died only a few days later in the gas chambers, but was only officially declared dead on 8 May 1945 by the Amtsgericht (District Court) Karlsruhe in 1950, when his date of death was put at the end of the war. Hirsch earned seven cups between 1911 and 1913, won the 1910 German Championship with Karlsruher FV and in 1914 with SpVgg Fürth. He joined the Karlsruher FV team for the first time when he was only 17-years-old (in 1909). As a left winger he became best known for his stooped running and his strong left-sided shots. In 1910, 1911 and 1912 he helped Karlsruher FV win the South German Championship and led them to the 1912 German national final, where they lost to Holstein Kiel 0-1. During the days of the Third Reich his name was not listed among the German Internationals. Hirsch then served in World War I and earned the Eiserne Kreuz II. Klasse (Iron Cross 2nd class). From 1919 he worked for the Deutsche Signalflaggenfabrik (German Signal Flag Factory) which was owned by his father. The company had restructured its products after the war to produce sports articles and leatherware. The trademark „Hirsch“ was best known worldwide for its leather footballs. After his father’s death, he and his brother Max inherited the company but it went bankrupt in 1933. He then worked as a commercial agent and as a football trainer in a Jewish club, but with little success in those troubled times. Hirsch divorced his wife in 1939 to protect his family against the Nazi Jewish terror. In 1943 he was informed by the Gestapo that he had to prepare himself for a “work effort” at Auschwitz and was deported soon. His children Heinold and Esther – so called “first half breeds” - were also deported in January 1945 to the Terezín concentration camp, but survived and returned to Karlsruhe on 16 June of the same year.

He was the son of Torben Grut, a top Swedish tennis player and a noted architect who designed the 1912 Olympic Stadium in Stockholm. Willie Grut was a talented swimmer, winning several freestyle titles in the 1930s, as well as a water polo title. He was picked for the Swedish relay team in Berlin, but did not actually compete there. However, in Berlin Grut learned about the modern pentathlon, a sport he took up afterwards. Being an officer with the Swedish artillery, Grut had the opportunity to train regularly in each of the five disciplines, and soon became one of Sweden’s best pentathletes - Sweden being the leading nation in the sport at the time. He would likely have been a top contender for the 1940 Olympic gold, had the Games not been cancelled due to war, so Grut had to be content with five Swedish titles: 1938-1940, 1944 and 1948. After the war, Grut first competed in the Winter Olympics, where a demonstration winter pentathlon was held. This was essentially a modern pentathlon competition, but with the cross-country running event replaced by cross-country skiing and swimming replaced by a downhill skiing event. Grut finished second in that competition, finishing behind compatriot Gustaf Lindh. Unlike Lindh, Grut also qualified for the actual modern pentathlon at the Summer Games, and Grut dominated that competition. He won three of the five events, and scored a record of only 16 place-points, for one of the most dominant modern pentathlon victories in international competition. The Svenska Dagbladet awarded him with the newspaper’s coveted gold medal for the best sports performance of the year. Grut, who had also won several Swedish rifling titles with his artillery regiment, subsequently retired from sports, but he remained active and coached Lars Hall to a gold medal at the 1952 and 1956 Games. In 1960, he appeared as Sweden’s flagbearer at the Olympic opening ceremony. That same year, he was elected as the secretary general of the International Modern Pentathlon and Biathlon Union (UIPMB), a post which he held through 1984.",Son of Torben Grut Listed in Olympic Order Recipients (1998 (Silver))

He confirmed his status as the best freestyle sprint swimmer at the Sydney Olympics. In a close race with home favourite Ian Thorpe, he won the 200 m freestyle in world record time. Two days later, in the Olympic semi-finals, he became the first man to swim the 100 m free in less than 48 seconds. He won the final as well, beating two-time champion Aleksandr Popov. In 2001 and 2003, Van den Hoogenband attempted to win a world title, but failed to do so. Throughout his career, he won 8 silver medals at the World Championships, but never a gold medal. He did retain his Olympic 100 m title in Athens, adding silver medals in the 200 and 4 x 100 relay. His career seemed over in 2005, when he was diagnosed with a hernia in his back, which had long been a painful area for the swimmer.

50058,Aleksandr Popov,Male,16 November 1971,200.0,87, Russian Federation  Unified Team,RUS,"Known by a variety of nicknames – “Sasha,” “The Russian Rocket,” “Ice Man,” and “Big Dog” – Aleksandr Popov is considered by many as the greatest sprint freestyle swimmer ever. Popov took up swimming at the age of eight and, at that time, he was afraid of water, but his father insisted on him taking swimming lessons. Popov started out as a backstroke swimmer and switched to freestyle only in 1990. A year later, Popov competed at his first international tournament, the 1991 European Championships, and established himself as the world’s top freestyle sprinter by winning the 100 freestyle and helping the Soviet team win both the 4x100 freestyle relay and medley relay titles. Nearly unbeatable in the 1990s, Popov won gold medals in the 50 and 100 sprint events at the 1992 and 1996 Olympics and added silver in both the 4x100 freestyle relay and medley relay at those Olympics. His comeback to world-class swimming after the Atlanta Olympics was the stuff of legend. During an altercation on a Moscow street with an Azeri watermelon vendor, he was stabbed in the abdomen, with the knife grazing his lung and an artery to his kidney. He required emergency surgery and spent three months in rehabilitation. Popov competed at the Sydney Olympics in 2000, but was touched out in the 100 by Pieter van den Hoogenband, winning a silver medal. Popov also competed in 2004, without winning a medal, and retired shortly after the Athens Olympic Games, where he was the Russian flagbearer at the Opening Ceremony. At the World Championships Popov won the 50 free in 1994 and 2003, and the 100 free in 1994, 1998, and 2003. His World Championship record saw him win gold six times, silver four times, and bronze once between 1994 and 2003. At the European Championships, after his three 1991 titles, Popov went on to win 21 gold and 26 totals medals, competing at that meet through 2004, and ending with gold in the 2004 50 metre freestyle. During his career Popov set one world record at both of the two sprint distances: 48.21 in the 100 free in 1994, which stood for six years, and 21.64 in the 50 free in 2000, which stood for eight years. Popov was elected as the European Swimmer of the Year in 1994 and 2003 and the Russian Athlete of the Year and European Sports Press Union Athlete of the Year in 1996. Popov was elected as a full member of the IOC in December 1999. He also represented the athletes on the IOC Sport for All Commission and was elected as one of seven athletes to the IOC Athletes’ Commission by the athletes participating in the 1996 Olympics. He was re-elected to the Athletes’ Commission at the 2000 Olympics and is now the IOC Athletes’ Commission’s Honorary Secretary. Popov has been named to the IOC Evaluation Commission for the 2016 Olympics. Popov is an advisor to the Russian president in sports matters and a member of the Executive Committee of the Russian National Olympic Committee. Since 2004, Popov has been vice-president of the Russian Swimming Federation.

In 1908, Bouin had partied prior to the 3-mile team race and was punished by French authorities who refused to recognize his time as a national record, and there is some confusion as to whether or not they allowed him to receive the bronze medal. Bouin was International Cross-Country Champion in 1912, just prior to the Stockholm Olympics, after having finished second in 1909. In 1913 he set a world record for the hour run with 19,021 metres (11 miles, 1,454 yards). Bouin served in World War I for France as a soldier with the 163e Régiment d’Infanterie.

2000563,Alvar Aalto,Male,3 February 1898,,, Finland,FIN,"Alvar Aalto was a Finnish architect and designer. His work includes architecture, furniture, textiles, and glassware, as well as sculptures and paintings. Over the course of his career from the 1920s to the 1970s, his style evolved from Nordic classicism to an international-style rational modernism in the 1930s to a more organic modernist style beginning in the 1940s. Typical is his striving for a total work of art, for which he designed not only the building, but also the interior surfaces, furniture, lamps, and even glassware. Aalto preferred to work with wood and is considered the inventor of curved plywood furniture. The Alvar Aalto Museum, which he designed himself, is in his hometown of Jyväskylä, where he lived from the age of five. After drawing lessons with a local artist, he attended the Helsinki University of Technology from 1916. His studies were interrupted by the Civil War, in which he fought for the White Army. After graduation he opened an architectural office in Jyväskylä. He married the architect Aino Marsio (1894-1949) and worked alongside her. Due to his success, he moved his office first to Turku, then in 1933 to Helsinki. After the early death of his first wife, he again married an architect, Elissa Mäkiniemi (1922-94), who had worked in his office. From the 1920s, along with a change to functionalism, he attracted attention with numerous writings. In the 1930s he maintained contacts with the artists of the Bauhaus and with the Swiss Le Corbusier. As early as 1938 he received a solo exhibition at MOMA in New York, and in the 1940s he was invited as a visiting professor to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. In the last two decades of his life Aalto mainly designed monumental buildings for Helsinki. From 1963-68 he was president of the Academy of Finland. In total, he designed more than 500 buildings, of which 300 were actually built, mostly in Finland (including the Finlandia Concert and Congress Hall in Helsinki), but also in France, Germany (opera house in Essen), Italy, and the United States. Which projects Aalto exhibited in 1952 is unknown, as they are listed generically as Stadium and Sportshalls. In 1933 he had participated in the competition for the Olympic Stadium in Helsinki for the 1940 Olympics. In 1949 he won the competition for the design of the Otaniemi compound. His proposal included the sports field, the sports hall, and some service buildings used for the training of Olympic athletes. Initially, the facilities were to be used for the 1952 Olympic Games and then they became part of the campus of the Technical University. The Otahalli sports hall in particular, built 1949-52, set standards with its wooden construction and is still in use.",

His father hailed from Aberdeen but moved south to work on a farm in the grounds of Windsor Castle where he looked after Queen Victoria’s pure-bred cattle stock. The Wilson family lived in the grounds of the castle and James and his twin brother John were educated at Windsor Park Royal School. After leaving school, Wilson served an apprenticeship with a local blacksmith. But his life took an unexpected turn in 1908 when the Olympic Marathon started in Windsor Park and the Wilson twins both took up athletics as a result of witnessing the start of the Olympic race. They both joined Slough Harriers as novices but it was James who made the quickest progress and in 1910 represented Slough at the Southern Counties Cross-country Championship. He won the North of the Thames Cross-country Championship in 1912 and a year later was runner-up in the Nationals. Because of his father’s Scottish birthplace, Wilson was tempted north of the border by Greenock Glenpark Harriers and his first appearance on a Scottish track in 1914 resulted in him winning the first of his two Scottish 4 miles titles. Wilson did not enlist during World War I but spent the war years in Greenock working in an essential occupation. Sadly his twin bother served on the front and died in 1916 after contracting peritonitis. After the war James resumed his athletic career and was the dual Scottish 4 and 10 mile champion in 1920. His greatest performance on the track was in the 10K at the 1920 Olympics when he stayed in contact with the great Paavo Nurmi and Joseph Guillemot to take third place, only five seconds behind the winner. He would be Britain’s last 10K medallist for 56 years until Brendan Foster repeated the feat at Montreal in 1976. Wilson also had an impressive record as a cross-country runner and won the International Championship shortly after winning his only Scottish title in 1920. He represented Scotland four times (1920-21, 1924-25) in the International race, having previously been sixth for England in 1914. In the 1920 Olympic cross-country event, he individually placed fourth and led Britain into second place in the team event.

Although he was a member of the NSDAP (Nazi Party), she was not allowed to exhibit in Germany, so she decided to stay in Italy alone despite financial difficulties. After the liberation of Italy in 1944, she was initially interned by the Allies, but was released through the intercession of her artist friends.

He got extremely close to winning a medal at the 1980 Games but was edged out by 3 votes to 2 on the judges’ scorecards in his quarter-final with the more experienced Valentin Silaghi of Romania. Kaylor wasted little time before embarking on a career as a professional boxer and had his first pro fight just two months after returning from the Soviet Union. He won his first 24 fights, culminating in a victory in an attempt on the British and Commonwealth titles, but in his very next fight he lost his temper and was disqualified for hitting the lightly regarded American journeyman Tony Cerda a number of times after the bell had rung for the end of the ninth round. He lost his titles in 1984 to Tony Sibson and the next year had an infamous encounter with Erroll Christie. At a time when racial tensions were high in the UK and the far-right National Front political party were gaining momentum, Christie claimed that Kaylor used a racial insult during a pre-fight press conference at a London casino that resulted in the two men being involved in a brawl for which both men were given large fines by the boxing authorities. Christie received racially motivated death threats but the fight still went on, albeit with massively increased security. Kaylor won the fight by knock-out but his career stalled afterwards. He would fight on for five years but lose on all four occasions that he challenged for the European title during that period. He retired with a record of 40 wins, 7 defeats and a draw as a professional. In 1996 he moved to California where he worked as a boxing coach and aerobics instructor in the city of Chino.",

He designed the famous silver Mercury Dime and his silver half dollar became known as the Walking Liberty Half Dollar, in use from 1916-47, whose motif was later used for the Silver Eagle, first produced in 1986, and a 10-cent coin. However, he also created numerous statues commissioned by a New York architecture practice. History largely classifies Weinman as a famous medalist, but he did not like this designation and was insistent that he wanted to be known as an architectural sculptor. In 1901 the Ball Thrower was created, a 48 cm high bronze. In some sources it is also referred to as Putting the Shot. If you take a closer look at the posture and the ball, another title, Spirit of Baseball, seems to be more appropriate.",

He was also Pan American Games and NCAA champion in 1959.

Her passion for the sport, however, had begun at the age of 9, when she went to a local arena to sign up for the women’s hockey team. When she discovered that the trainer intended to form a speed skating team, however, she focused her energies on that sport instead. Her Olympic career began in 1980 and she participated in five consecutive Winter Olympic Games. Knee operations in 1985 and 1987, however, forced her to switch from long to short track speed skating beginning at the 1988 Games. Although it was only a demonstration sport that year, Daigle took home five medals, gold in the 1500 metres, silvers in the 1000 and 3000 metres and bronze in the 500 metres and the 3000 metre relay, showing her promise in the sport. At the next Winter Games, short track speed skating was introduced as an official event and Daigle’s dedication and perseverance paid off; she won gold and silver in the 3000 metre relay in 1992 and 1994 respectively. Daigle was a serious contender in the 500 metre event in 1992, but a collision with Cathy Turner cost her a medal. Daigle began her studies in medicine after the 1992 Games, but put them on hold to compete in 1994.

Theile had a unique turn which seemed to help him gain time on his opponents, and was of contested legality. He was given an unofficial warning by the judges at the 1956 Olympics for using this turn in the heats and decided to use a more orthodox method for the semi-final. In the final he reverted to his original technique and used it to good effect as he finished exactly a second ahead of Monckton to claim the 1956 Olympic title. In 1960, Monckton was even with Theile on the outward lap at the final, but misjudged the turn and broke a finger as he smashed into the wall, finishing in a disappointing seventh position. Between Olympics, when Theile took a break from swimming to concentrate on medical studies, Monckton won the 110 yd backstroke and 4x110 yd medley relay golds at the 1958 British Empire and Commonwealth Games.

4172,Carlo Saraudi,Male,4 February 1899,,, Italy,ITA,"Carlo Saraudi was an Italian boxer and coach who was the Italian light-heavyweight amateur champion in 1923 and 1924. He then represented Italy at the 1924 Paris Olympics where, having reached the semi-finals after two wins on points, he met the British boxer, Harry Mitchell, losing on points in a controversial decision. In protest against the referee’s decision, the Italian Boxing Federation immediately withdrew its athletes, and Saraudi was unable to fight for the bronze and settled for fourth place. Saraudi turned pro in 1925. He was unbeaten after seven matches in Civitavecchia and Roma, and left to seek his fortune in the United States. With the pseudonym of Jack Moresco he fought 15 matches, with 9 wins, 4 draws, and 2 defeats. Saraudi returned to Italy in 1928 where he served as a sparring partner for Vittorio Tamagnini, who would win the gold medal in bantamweight at the 1928 Amsterdam Games. Saraudi then returned to the ring, winning six consecutive bouts. On 10 February 1931, in Torino, he faced Preciso Merlo for the vacant national light-heavyweight title, but lost on points. Saraudi retired in 1932 with a professional record of 20 wins, 3 losses, and 7 draws. Saraudi later embarked on a career as a coach with the Civitavecchia boxing club. Among the boxers he trained were his sons Giulio Saraudi and Vittorio, both among the top Italian light-heavyweights of the 1960s. On his death, Civitavecchia named its sports field after him, now Parco Saraudi. In 2015 the Civitavecchia Boxing Gym was officially dedicated to him.",Father of Giulio Saraudi

921777,Norman Wilkinson,Male,24 November 1878,,, Great Britain,GBR,"Norman Wilkinson was a British artist who was considered the doyen of British marine artists. He was educated at Berkhamsted School of Art and St. Paul’s Cathedral Choir School. In 1898 Wilkinson began contributing to The Illustrated News and The Illustrated Mail, which was the beginning of a long association. In Paris in 1899 he studied figure painting but was already set upon working on marine subjects. He had a painting of Plymouth that hung in the smoking salon of the Titanic. During World War I Wilkinson served in the Dardanelles, on submarine patrol in the Mediterranean and a minesweeper in the English Channel. While not an official war artist, he made many drawings of his time in the Dardanelles. During World War II he invented “dazzle” camouflage to protect merchant ships from attack. Wilkinson was best known for his work in water colors, and in 1937 was elected President of the Royal Institute of Painters in Water Colours. He was also a member of the Royal Institute of Oil Painters. Wilkinson was an experienced sailor and was the Official Marine Painter to the Royal Yacht Squadron. In 1948 Wilkinson only participated “out of competition” because he was also a member of the jury. He depicted fishing and here especially Trout Fishing in several oil paintings and numerous etchings. In the title they often differ only by indicating the localities in Great Britain, the USA or Canada, which, however, is missing in the art catalog. Among others, Trout Fishing on the Test (etching, 19.5 x 26 cm), Trout Fishing on Loch Laggan (etching, 22 x 31 cm) or Trout Fishing in Maine (etching, 22 x 30 cm) are potential candidates. The painting Fastnet Race is shown in the catalog, but could not be identified elsewhere. Also Pool at Findhorn could not be verified. The Fastnet Race is a traditional regatta on a course between the Isle of Wight, Ireland and Cherbourg, while the Findhorn River is a river in Scotland rich in fish with the spectacular Sluie Pool. Evening rise, Loch Poulary also shows a fishing scene on a lake in the Scottish Highlands (35.5 x 50.8 cm). The latter was an oil painting, probably also Wilkinson’s other paintings exhibited in 1948.",

45163,Neil Brooks,Male,27 July 1962,198.0,96, Australia,AUS,"Neil Brooks was born in England, but immigrated to Australia with his family when he was 4-years-old. Thought to be the most promising Australian freestyle sprinter at the start of 1980s, his talent was never fully deployed as, known for his rebellious nature, Brooks often found himself in conflict with swimming officials. He débuted at the 1976 Australian championships at 13-years-old and first medaled at those championships in 1978, narrowly missing out on selection to the 1978 Australian Commonwealth Games team. Brooks débuted at international level at a 1979 World Cup meet and in 1980 was selected to the Australian Olympic team by finishing second behind Mark Tonelli in the 100 freestyle at the 1980 Australian Championships. The peak of his swimming career probably came at the medley relay final at the Moscow Olympics, when Brooks caught and then passed the 200 freestyle gold medalist Soviet Sergey Koplyakov during the anchor leg to seal a narrow victory for Australia, which remains the only time that the United States has not won this event at the Olympics through 2016. Following the Olympics, Brooks was expelled from the Australian Institute of Sport for disciplinary reasons, so he accepted a swimming scholarship at the University of Arkansas, studying journalism. At the 1982 Commonwealth Games, Brooks won three gold medals – 100 freestyle, 4x100 m freestyle relay and medley relay, which earned him Western Australia’s Sportsman of the Year title. He competed at his second Olympics in 1984, and competing only in relays, won silver in the 4x100 free relay and bronze in medley relay. He graduated from Arkansas in 1985, and then last competed internationally at the 1986 Commonwealth Games, where he won gold in the 4x1 free relay and silver in the 100 free. Brooks was expelled from the Australian national team after being suspended for his drinking binge during the return trip, so he retired from competitive swimming. After his retirement, Brooks entered the media. He worked with Seven Network, commenting on Australian Football League matches and read the sports segment on the weekday evening news. He was also the commentator at the 1988, 1992 and 1996 Summer Olympics and, aside from covering swimming and water polo, he also commentated on volleyball and in 1998, commented on various Alpine skiing events at the Nagano Winter Olympics. Brooks also hosted Brooksy’s Footy Show, a Western Australian travel/holiday show called Wild West, and in the lead-up to the Sydney Olympics, co-hosted “The Games” with Tracey Holmes. However, Brooks’ career began to unravel in the late-90s as he became addicted to alcohol, leading to a series of on-screen incidents. He once read the sports news segment while inebriated, and was then involved in a drunken argument with Nine Network’s Australian rules football pundit Sam Newman. In early 1999, Seven suspended him from on-screen duties for six weeks after he made comments that they deemed to be “tasteless and offensive”. In an interview with a magazine that had not been authorized by Seven Network, he was asked what event he was looking forward to most at the 2000 Olympics in Sydney, and replied “The after-Olympics piss-up”. Brooks was eventually sacked, denying him the opportunity to commentate on the swimming events at the 2000 Olympics. In fall 2000, Brooks was declared bankrupt by the Federal Court in Perth after failing to repay a debt to BankWest. In May 2001, the police raided his Perth home and found a metre-high cannabis plant, which Brooks claimed belonged to a friend. After relocating to South Australia in 2003, he established a lifestyle magazine called Local, run entirely by he and his wife. He later became a partner in Nitro Energy Drink Company, which was involved in motorsport sponsorship. However, the firm suffered from financial trouble and he had a falling out with his business partner, so Brooks was removed from the board and the company was put into administration.

Although Finland has won two other international weightlifting medals (bronzes by Jouni Grönman and Pekka Niemi), those medals were won in lighter competition at the 1984 Olympics.

Lambert played in the 1900 Olympic golf event in Compiègne, France, finishing eighth. When plans were being made for the 1904 Olympics in St. Louis, Lambert and his father-in-law, Col. George McGrew, were instrumental in bringing golf to their own Glen Echo Country Club. Lambert, a left-handed golfer, played again and made it to the quarter-finals individually in addition to playing on the second-place team. Lambert’s most notable achievement in golf was winning the 1907 Missouri Amateur. He played in the US Amateur in 1903 and 1905, losing in the first round both times. In 1896, Lambert had taken over the family business, the Lambert Pharmacal Co. This later became Warner-Lambert, which marketed Listerine, invented by Al Lambert’s father. Lambert was also a pioneer in aviation in the United States. In 1920 he purchased Kinoch Field, from which he flew bi-planes and balloons. He later donated the field to the city of St. Louis, and it eventually became Lambert International Airport, St. Louis’ main airport. In 1927, when Charles Lindbergh made his trans-Atlantic flight, he was sponsored by a group of St. Louis businessmen. The group was started, and headed, by Al Lambert. He was known in St. Louis as the “Dean of Aviation”. Lambert was always a US citizen, but he entered the 1900 Olympic golf tournament playing out of the Golf Club de Paris, although he was also a member of the Glen Echo Country Club in St. Louis at the time.",
