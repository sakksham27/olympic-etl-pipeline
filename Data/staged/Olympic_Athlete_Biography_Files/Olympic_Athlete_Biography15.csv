97300,Othmar Schneider,Male,27 August 1928,,, Austria,AUT,"A great all-around skier, Othmar Schneider’s greatest success came at the 1952 Olympics, where he won the slalom and placed second. He might have won a third medal in the combined, but that event had been discontinued after 1948 and replaced by the giant slalom. It was held as a World Championship event in subsequent Olympics, but not in Oslo. While not managing to win any additional medals in international championships (Schneider ranked fourth in the 1954 World Championship giant slalom), he did win various honors in major races in Europe and North America. In 1951, he won the famous Arlberg-Kandahar slalom (held in Sestriere that year), while winning the Wengen downhill and combined two years in a row (1951-1952). After the 1956 Winter Olympics, Schneider switched to the pros, competing in two Professional World Championships. In the meanwhile, he switched focus to a second sport, pistol shooting. A 34-fold Austrian champion (17 individual titles), he won a World Championships team bronze in the free pistol (1974) and a European Championship team bronze in the center-fire pistol (1975). A third Olympic appearance in the sport was impossible because of Schneider’s past, having been a pro and a skiing teacher in the US and Chile. Schneider, who was course manager at the 1966 World Championships in Chile, later managed his own hotel in Lech, and owned and managed Huber, a manufacturer of skiing apparel and accessories. In 1976, he also managed his third appearance at the Olympic Games as the coach of Austrian’s sport shooters, and his pupil Rudolf Dollinger won a bronze medal in those games.","Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the World Shooting Championships (0–0–1 1974 Bern/Thun bronze: 50 m free pistol team) Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the World Alpine Ski Championships (1–1–0 1952 Oslo (Olympics) gold: slalom, silver: downhill)"

In 1952, Teräsvirta submitted his plans for the Swimming-baths, Ilosaari. Ilosaari is the most famous island in the Pielisjoki River in the city of Joensuu. A swimming pool with wooden diving towers was built here as early as 1907. In the 1940s, the old facilities were abandoned and construction of the new Ilosaari 25 metre pool began in 1946 and was completed in 1949. It was eventually demolished in the 1970s.",

He served in the Army for a total of 27 years and saw service as a corporal in the second Boer War, until he was invalided home in 1900 after just six months, suffering from enteric fever. Shortly afterwards, he was appointed to the permanent staff of the Royal Jersey Militia and remained in service until 1918, having attained the rank of sergeant major. As a fine marksman, Kempster was a former honorary secretary of the Jersey Rifle Association, and represented the island at the annual Bisley Meeting on many occasions. He won two Olympic team pistol bronze medals at the 1912 Stockholm Olympics after failing to medal at the London Games four year earlier. As well as being a fine shot, Kempster was a good standard gymnast and fencer, and taught both sports during his time in the Army. He was also a top athlete and amateur boxer and was a one-time Army lightweight champion. On the island of Jersey, however, Kempster was better known for his voice as a celebrated opera and operetta singer. Kempster had the Albert Medal conferred upon him by King George V for gallantry after stopping runaway horses near Pontac, Jersey, in September 1910. His actions probably saved the lives of the two women and two children aboard the carriage.",

She attended Kimball Union Academy and graduated in 1900 from the Massachusetts Normal Art School. The same year she married attorney Edward Leighton (1876-1941), and then studied in Paris and Wien (Vienna). The couple moved to Los Angeles in 1910, where Kathryn opened a studio. Doing floral still lifes and landscapes, she repeatedly depicted her favorite subject, which was the desert in bloom. She especially painted big-screen scenes of glaciers, which resulted from trips to Glacier National Park beginning in 1923. In 1918, Leighton started to paint American Indian portraits, many of them signed by the sitter, and this endeavor brought her international recognition. In 1926, she was introduced to the Blackfeet Indians, who adopted her into their tribe under her Indian name Anna-Tar-Kee, after she had spent several summers with them, painting portraits of the old chiefs and other prominent members of the tribe. She also painted the Sioux and Cherokee in Oklahoma and did other Indian portraits from her studio in Los Angeles. These portraits, totaling about 700, remained a valuable, lasting historical record of their customs, clothing and lore. Some of the portraits were commissioned by the Great Northern Railway for tourism advertising. Her brother Frederick Woodman (1871-1949) exhibited many of her paintings in his office as mayor of Los Angeles. Images of Leighton’s paintings entered in the art competitions, probably oil paintings, could not be found. But there is a description of one painting in a contemporary newspaper: “Of striking interest is the portrait of The Cherokee Athlete, a distinguished Indian runner, by Kathryn W. Leighton, of Los Angeles. … This particular runner is a full-blooded Indian of magnificent physique, a graduate of the University of Oklahoma, and a leader among his people—one who is endeavoring to keep alive typical Indian costumes, and encouraging the development along racial lines of Indian Art.”",

921612,Carl Rungius,Male,18 August 1869,,, United States,USA,"Carl Rungius studied at the Berlin Art Academy from 1888-90, and then frequently sketched animals at the zoo. His dedication to painting animals with anatomical accuracy was coupled with his determination to learn and paint each animal’s mannerisms and habitat, which made Rungius a well-respected wildlife artist. Rungius traveled to the USA for the first time in 1894 and got to know the nature and fauna of the American West in Wyoming. He eventually emigrated to the United States in 1896, where he painted and hunted western big game animals, including moose, pronghorn and bighorn sheep in the Rocky Mountains, and he completed these paintings during the long New York winters. Equally accomplished as a painter of wildlife and landscapes, Rungius quickly developed an enthusiastic following among fellow artists and patrons. Later he opened a second studio in Banff, Canada. With his realistic, sometimes romantically exaggerated pictures, Rungius also tried to promote nature conservation. One of his admirers and hunting companions was President Theodore Roosevelt (1858-1919). The painting The Panic could be the painting Stampede, which literally translated means “panic escape”. However, this painting in oil on canvas (56 x 66 cm) was created in 1898 during his first years in the USA. It was donated to the National Museum of Wildlife Art around 2012. Slightly modified, the motif also exists as an etching. Wounded Moose was also painted by Rungius quite early (1901-04). It was then in the possession of George D. Pratt (1869-1935), who – like Rungius – was an environmentalist and hunter. The oil painting Survival of the Fittest (66 x 117 cm) from the collection of the National Museum of Wildlife Art, which also shows a wounded or dead moose in the foreground, was created in this period. Possibly the works are identical.",

He won the AAA 100y for four successive years (1904-07) and placed second in the 220y (1907), before placing third at 100 y in 1908. He won the Midland 100 y (1906) and 220 y (1904, 1907). He was rather past his peak at the 1908 Olympics and was eliminated in the second round of the 100 and the first round of the 200. Morton showed his best form in 1904 when he equaled the world 120 y record beating 100 y world record holder and 9.6 man, Arthur Duffey (USA), at least 12 times, including a victory at the AAA Championships. Morton would undoubtedly have contended for the 1904 Olympic 100 title had he been in St. Louis. In 1905 he toured North America after the close of the English season and beat future Olympic 200 champion, Bobby Kerr, to set a Canadian All-Comers 100 y record of 9.8. Two weeks later Morton won the 100 y and 120 y hurdles at the Canadian Championships before crossing the border for his first experience of indoor competition at Madison Square Garden.

He resided in New York from 1903, but returned to Taos, New Mexico in 1914. There, he also founded the Tao Society of Artists after focusing on painting. Dunton produced hundreds of covers and illustrated numerous books, including several of the classic cowboy stories of Zane Grey.

In between, she equalled the Scottish native record of 11.4 for the 100 and, at the 1951 Scottish Universities Championships, set an all-comers’ record of 11.2 for the 100 and a native record 12.2 for the 80 metres hurdles. It was a record that stood for seven years. Having finished third in the WAAA 60 metres in 1948, she won the title in 1950, when she was also second to June Foulds in the 100 yards. In the same event two years later, she again finished second, but this time to Heather Armitage.

In a great gesture of fair play, Rector did not hesitate but spent the next day tutoring his soon-to-be conqueror.

The team then reached the pursuit final against Denmark. The Germans always led and the race looked over when, after 9 of 12 laps, a Danish rider went off the back. However, they re-grouped but still trailed at the bell. The German team then began to split, with Jürgen Kissner dropping off the pace. As his teammate Karl Heinz Henrichs passed him, Kissner’s hand appeared to touch him, possibly giving him a slight push. Germany held on to win by 3½ seconds, but Kissner was an East German defector and East Germany immediately protested that the touch had been an illegal shove. After a 15-minute conference among the judges, West Germany was disqualified, and Italy and the Soviet Union were announced as the silver and bronze medal winners. FRG officials then protested, stating that Italy and the Soviets should not be placed ahead of their riders. Another long conference ensued, and the result was announced as Denmark first and Italy third. No silver medal placement was given until a meeting of the Fédération Internationale Amateur de Cyclisme (FIAC, later the UCI) in November, when West Germany was awarded second place and their silver medals. In 1960, Kissner was a substitute on the East German pursuit team at the Roma Olympics, but did not compete. He then won two East German national titles, with the pursuit team of TSC Berlin. He defected to the West during the 1964 inter-national qualifications, and won a silver (1966) and a bronze (1967) with the West German pursuit team at the World Championships. In 1967, he also won the West German national omnium title. After his active career, Kissner started a short coaching career as an assistant to his team-mate Udo Hempel, before becoming a sports and biology teacher in Cologne.",

He started his footballing career with National Sporting Club in Cairo where he forged a reputation as a goal scorer when he was still in his mid-teens. Leaving Egypt to study engineering at University College, London in 1911 he began to play for Dulwich Hamlet, one of London’s top amateur clubs. After three months his performances began to attract attention and he was offered a chance to play in the English League for Fulham. The first Egyptian to play in England, his debut against Stockport County was spectacular, he scored within fifteen minutes and the Athletic News paid him the following compliment in verse. Fulham was proud of her player from Cairo Fulham was just like a dog with two tails - Dulwich, you’ll find in a terrible ire-o, If for high amateur honour she fails. But at such prospect all Dulwichites smile, Backing the luck of this lad from the Nile. Despite such praise this was to be Hegazi’s only match for Fulham as he returned to play for Dulwich Hamlet the next week. His performances for Hamlet brought him to the attention of the London County selectors and he made the first of his five representative appearances for the team against Middlesex in December 1911. In 1913 he was admitted to St. Catharine’s College, Cambridge although he withdrew from his course after just two terms. However in the short time he attended the University he was chosen to play in the Varsity match against Oxford. Playing alongside fellow Olympian Max Woosnam, he played well as Cambridge defeated Oxford 2-1. With Egypt entering a period of unrest he returned home in 1914 where he founded and played for his own team, the “Hussein Hegazi II” and also played for Sekka Railways. He then joined Al-Ahly where he played between 1915 and 1923 when he joined their arch-rivals Zamalek. Hegazi had another season with Al-Ahly in 1928-29 before he finally retired at the age of 40 following a final spell with Zamalek. He was a member of the Egyptian squad in two Olympics. Also a talented athlete he is reputed to have won four successive national championships at both 440y and 880y. The novelist Naguib Mahfouz, 1988 Nobel Prize winner for Literature, said of his childhood hero, “Hussein Hegazi, displayed exemplary sportsmanship on the pitch. Throughout his career, Hegazi never committed a foul.”",

901536,Joe Swindells,Male,20 April 1913,,, Great Britain,GBR,"Although educated at New Mills Grammar School in north Derbyshire, close to the lacrosse “hot-spot” of Stockport, Joe Swindells’ job as a construction engineer took him around the country, and consequently he played for lacrosse teams in both the Northern and Southern Leagues. Before World War II, he played for London side Willoughby, and in 1937, made the first of several appearances in the annual South versus North match. That same year he was in the Middlesex side beaten by Cheshire in the County Championship final. The following year, Swindells scored six goals for Willoughby as they beat Surbiton 19-3 in the Southern Flags final. Unfortunately, Willoughby lost 12-2 to Old Waconians in the Iroquois Cup. After the War, Swindells played for Hampstead, and was again on the losing side in the Iroquois Cup, after his new team lost, again, to Old Waconians. In 1949 he played for The South against The North. The game ended 9-9, and was the first time since 1908 that The North had failed to win. Later that year, after moving to Birmingham to work, Swindells played for both the Birmingham and Leicester lacrosse clubs. He ended his career with the Yorkshire side Old Grovians, in the third division of the North of England Lacrosse Association, leaving them midway through the 1954/55 season to work and live abroad. A one-time assistant secretary of the South of England Lacrosse Association, Swindells, whilst serving as a lieutenant with the Royal Engineers in October 1945, became one of a small handful of mountaineers to have climbed the 18,500 ft Mount Damavand in Tehran. He made the climb accompanied by two other men. Swindells later retired to Cyprus in 1974 where he lived in Kyrenia with his wife. He was found dead at his home in April 2005 aged 92, apparently strangled and beaten by an intruder. In late May 2005, Turkish Cypriot Yalçın Hüseyin Solat, 42, who previously spent time in prison for the murder of his neighbour in 1998, was arrested for Swindells’ murder, and reportedly later confessed upon interrogation by authorities. He was sentenced to life in prison after a trial in 2008.",Listed in Olympians Who Were Murdered (Killed at his home in Cyprus by an intruder.)

She won gold medals at the World Under-23 Championships in both 1999 and 2000 before stepping up to the senior national squad for the 2001 season. Flood switched boats several times before finding a home in the quadruple sculls in 2004. She met with immediate success after switching to the pair as the crew finished in the silver medal position at the Athens Olympics. After a year competing in the double sculls she returned to the quad in 2006 and won her first world title although this was only after the Russian crew were disqualified for a doping infringement, after they had crossed the line first. Their title was retained in 2007 and it was a great disappointment to the crew that they could not emulate this success at the 2008 Olympics. In Beijing they were victims of a mild upset as they could not match the crew from the host country in the final. After taking a year off in 2009, Flood returned to the sport to add a third world title in 2010 but, in contrast, the crew failed to even reach the final of the 2011 World Championships. She competed in her third Olympics the following year but failed to add to her medal collection when the British team finished fifth, but received ample compensation four months later when Flood became the first woman in the 194-year history of the Leander Club to be appointed their captain. In 2015 she rowed from London to Paris and raised over £300,000 for charity. Flood graduated from Reading University after studying Physiology and Biochemistry and is a member of the “Christians in Sport” organization.",

His most famous work Die Blaue Stunde (The Blue Hour), which described the German invasion of Poland, however, was not to be published. He was then reactivated and drafted into the reserves as a lieutenant. At times, Lernet-Holenia published under the pseudonym Clemens Neydisser. From 1969-72 he was president of the Austrian PEN Club, but eventually resigned in protest against the award of the Nobel Prize for Literature to well-known German writer Heinrich Böll. Lernet-Holenia was a poet, novelist, dramatist, and writer of screenplays and historical studies who produced a heterogeneous literary opus that included poetry, psychological novels, and recreational films. In 1920, he was adopted by his mother’s wealthy family, and took the double name Lernet-Holenia. Rumors that attributed biological fatherhood to a Habsburg archduke were perpetuated by biographers but were never substantiated. His short story The Marathon was released in 1935 as one of nine stories in the anthology The New Atlantis. The author tells us why the mythical first marathon runner collapsed dead after the announcing the Greek victory over the Persians.

While Onishchenko was fencing with Brit Adrian Parker, something odd was noticed, as Onishchenko’s sword registered a hit although he did not appear to have come close to one. In the next match against Jeremy Fox, the same thing happened. The Brits requested that Onishchenko’s sword be inspected and it was found to be rigged so that it could register a hit even when one had not been made. Onishchenko was disqualified, which resulted in the elimination of the Soviet team. The Brits went on to win their first Olympic gold in modern pentathlon, but Onishchenko was banned for life from sports, and later given the nickname Boris Dis-onyshchenko. Besides his success at the Olympic Games, Onishchenko was also successful at the World Championships. He was the individual champion in 1971 and won the team titles in 1969, 1971, 1973 and 1974. He also won two silvers (1969 in individual and 1970 in team event) and four bronzes (1967 in team and 1970, 1973, 1974 in individual event). Onishchenko was also Soviet champion three times (1969, 1970, 1976).",

Vijiaratnam left his native country and studied engineering in England at the start of the 1950s before returning home to take up a post with the Port of Singapore Authority. A recurring thigh injury forced a switch from the football pitch to the hockey field and he soon found himself included as a centre-forward for Singapore’s pre-Olympic tour of Indonesia.

As a youngster he had played with Birchcliff Midget teams in the Toronto Hockey League (TOHL) and moved to their higher division with the Toronto Tip Top Tailors in 1944. In addition, he also played one game with the Toronto Marlboros of the Junior Ontario Hockey Association (JOHA) that year, who were the junior team with the Toronto Maple Leafs. He split 1945 between the Toronto Army Daggers of the Senior Ontario Hockey Association (SOHA) and TOHL’s Toronto Army Shamrocks. He returned to the Tip Top Tailors in 1946. At the time of his call from Watson, Dowey had been playing with the Toronto Barkers of the TOHL for two years (and had claimed a championship in 1947) in addition to his duties with the Toronto Maple Leafs and his job with the Toronto Transit Commission. A Toronto city bus driver, he had to obtain a leave of absence from his work before he would be able to join the team and thus it was up to Sandy Watson, the team’s manager, to convince Dowey’s boss and future mayor of Toronto Allan Lamport to allow his potential goalie to play. Pressed for time, he accomplished this feat by means of a 1:30 AM phone call. Half an hour later, Dowey received the call that he was to be at the airport in four hours. At the tournament, where Canada won the gold medal, he posted a 0.62 goals-against average, which remains an Olympic record, and his use of the trapper glove was a new sight to the Europeans. He returned to the Barkers for a season after the Games, and then spent a year with the Toronto Staffords of the TOHL before retiring from active play. As a member of his gold medal-winning Olympic team, he was inducted into the Canadian Olympic Hall of Fame in 2008 and received a personal induction into the Etobicoke Sports Hall of Fame in 2001.",Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the World Ice Hockey Championships (1–0–0 1948 St. Moritz (Olympics) gold)

Initially a high jumper, he switched to javelin in his teens after a serious injury. His career highlight came at the 1976 Olympics, where he won a gold medal with a world record of 94.58, thrown in the first round of the final. At the 1976 Olympics, Németh was not considered a favorite, although he had been ranked as the #1 javelin thrower in the world in 1975, because he had never before medaled at major international tournament. Besides his Olympic gold, he won javelin gold at the 1970 Universiade, and also competed at four European Championships (1966, 1971, 1974 and 1978), with a best finish of fifth in 1966. Németh was four times Hungarian champion (1973, 1980, 1981 and 1983) and was ranked as the #1 javelin thrower in the world three years in a row from 1975-77. In 1976 he was elected as the Hungarian Sportsman of the Year and from 1975-77 he was named as the Hungarian Track & Field Athlete of the Year. After finishing his sporting career, Németh remained active in athletics field as a coach, organizer and inventor. From 1981-84, he was the throwing coach of the Italian national women’s team and coached such javelin stars as Tessa Sanderson and Jan Železný. From 1977-85, he was the main organizer of the Budapest Athletics Grand Prix and in 1991 was elected as vice-president of the Hungarian Athletics Federation. In 1986 Németh invented a training device called Body Roll. In 1987 he designed a new type of javelin, with a serrated tail, and Železný (89.66) and Steve Backley (90.98) set two world records with this model in 1990, but the IAAF banned it in 1991. The next year, Németh designed another new model javelin and Železný threw it 94.74 m, which was more than three metres better than the existing world record, but as the javelin was never ratified by the IAAF, the mark was not ratified. Németh continued to be the leading javelin designer of the world throughout 1990s and 2000s with his company, Németh Javelins.

The following year she finished fourth at the Canadian senior championships and, in 1967, was Canada’s senior runner-up in addition to attending her first World Championship, where she placed 12th in the singles competition. She began to rise in prominence with the 1968 retirement of Petra Burka and captured the Canadian championship that year, although she placed only 7th at the World Championships and the Winter Olympics. The following season brought triumphs, as she placed second in the Canadian and North American Championships, as well as tragedy when, as she prepared for the World Championships, it was discovered that she had stress fractures in both of her legs and she spent the next three months in leg casts. Nevertheless, Magnussen made a quick recovery and comeback in 1970, capturing the Canadian championship and placing fourth in the World Championships. In addition to her silver medal at the 1972 Winter Olympics she continued her reign as Canadian champion through 1973, for a total of five years, as well as becoming North American champion in 1971, and climbing the podium at the World Championships every year, from bronze in 1971, to silver in 1972 and, finally, gold in 1973. In that year, she was not only a World champion (a feat that, as of 2009, has yet to be repeated by a Canadian female), but was also named Canadian female athlete of the year, inducted into the Canadian Sports Hall of Fame and was made an Officer of the Order of Canada. She ended her amateur career and skated professionally with the Ice Capades until 1977, and then took up a career as a skating coach, first in Boston, and then in her home town of Vancouver. She was made a member of the Skate Canada Hall of Fame in 1996. As of 2009 she was the director of skating and head coach at the North Shore Winter Club.

He participated in five Olympic Games from 1964-84, only missing 1980 because of the US-led boycott. At his first Olympic appearance in 1964, Kuhweide was the object of Cold War intrigue between the NOCs of the former GDR and FRG. He had lost the inter-national races against GDR sailor Bernd Dehmel, but was the reigning European champion (because GDR sailors had not received an entry permit to come to Denmark). The International Yachting Union IYRU then ordered a race-off in Japan at Enoshima Island on Sagami Bay before the Games, but Dehmel refused to participate. Per the IOC, both sailors should have competed in the first four regattas, with the loser eliminated, but the IYRU did not agree with this. Kuhweide was asked to withdraw by the East German NOC, but the West Germans would not accept this. With only an hour before the first regatta, IOC president Avery Brundage chose Kuhweide for the regatta, who then won the gold medal in the Finn Monotype class. Four years later at Acapulco Kuhweide finished a disappointing 15th. He then moved to the Star class and won a bronze medal in 1972 at Kiel with Karsten Meyer. Another four years later, then sailing in Soling class, he finished sixth at Ontario Lake. Finally, he came back in 1984, again in Soling, and finished eighth at Long Beach, near Los Angeles. At Los Angeles, he was also the flagbearer for West Germany at the Opening Ceremony. Kuhweide also won four World and three European Championships.

He then was falsely imprisoned in a New York mental hospital for the last 16 years of his life, before dying on his 73rd birthday after months in a coma, caused by a heart attack. The figure Skippy is considered an important inspiration for the Peanuts comic strip by Charles Schulz. Crosby submitted only one painting in 1932, and this one only “Hors concours”.

Jerome took up track at the age of 17 and broke his first national record, in the 220 yards, one year later, eventually earning himself a scholarship to the University of Oregon. Within another two years he had not only represented his nation at the 1959 Pan American Games and the 1960 Summer Olympics, but in July 1960 had also tied West German Armin Hary’s world record of 10.0 in the 100 metres, which had been set less than a month previously. At the Olympics, a pulled muscle cost him his chance at racing in the 100 m final, and he was also eliminated in the opening round of the 4×100 metre relay alongside Lynn Eves, George Short, and Terry Tobacco. After tying the 9.2 second world record of Americans Frank Budd and Bob Hayes in the 100 yards, giving him the distinction of holding the 100 metre and yard world records concurrently, he suffered a leg injury at the 1962 British Empire and Commonwealth Games that nearly cost him his career. He recovered in time to attend the 1964 Summer Olympics, however, and won bronze in the 100 m behind Hayes and Enrique Figuerola of Cuba. He was also fourth in the 200 m, missing the podium by 0.16 seconds. Along the way, he was offered an opportunity to play Canadian football with the Montreal Alouettes, but declined. Jerome still hungered for gold, however, and earned it at the 1966 British Empire and Commonwealth and the 1967 Pan American Games in the 100 yards and metres respectively. At the former, he was also fifth in the 4x110 yard relay with Don Domansky and the non-Olympians Ed Hearne and Terry Tomlinson. His final major international tournament was the 1968 Summer Olympics, where he finished seventh in the 100 m and was eliminated in the quarterfinals of the 200 m. He retired after the Games and worked to promote sports and physical activity across Canada, dying of a brain aneurysm at the age of only 42. Among numerous honors, he was made an Officer of the Order of Canada in 1971 and received a star on Canada’s Walk of Fame in 2001.

In the following World Cup season (2005), he often struggled to qualify to the second round of the 30 best jumpers. In 2006, he competed in one World Cup event, his last international competition, in his hometown of Sapporo on 5 March 2006.

42281,Tom Caldwell,Male,1854,,, Great Britain,GBR,"Tom Caldwell was born in Kilmarnock and started an apprenticeship as a watchmaker and jeweller, but felt there was little scope for him to practice his skills and moved to Glasgow to finish his apprenticeship. Shortly after the move, Caldwell joined the famous 3rd Lanark Volunteer Regiment and it was then that his passion for rifle shooting began. An offer to enhance his career saw Caldwell move across the water to Ireland when he was in his 20s, when he moved to the City of Derry. He soon joined the Derry Rifle Club, which was in decline at the time, but he soon contributed towards its revival. He later moved to Belfast and joined the Ulster Rifle Association, who had some of the finest shooting ranges in the United Kingdom at the time. Caldwell also got a job with Sharman D. Neil Limited, the famous Belfast firm of goldsmiths and jewellers, and he would stay with them for many years and eventually become a director of the company. Although Caldwell was selected to represent Ireland in the 1880 Anglo-Irish shooting match, he never forgot his roots and, in the international Elcho Shield at Bisley, involving the four counties of the United Kingdom, he chose to represent his country of birth, Scotland, which he did for more than 30 years after making his début in 1881. Caldwell won countless honours in Ireland and also enjoyed successes at Bisley including the 1900 Halford Memorial Challenge Cup and the 1910 Waldegrave Match Rifle event with a score of 98 out of 100. He competed at Bisley for the 40th consecutive year in 1928 and just missed out on a prize by one point. He was in his 75th year at the time. Caldwell’s contribution to shooting in Ireland was vast and he spent many years holding the Ulster Rifle Association together as secretary and later vice-chairman.",

Lee and Stonewall Jackson in Wyman Park, Baltimore, Maryland, the three relief panels at the entrance to the library at West Point, and a white granite figure of Pegasus at Brook Green Gardens, South Carolina.

He won Soviet football titles in 1946-48 and 1953, and was capped three times. All those three matches were played at the 1952 Olympics and he scored five goals in those three matches. He was also the best goal scorer at the Soviet Championships in 1945 (24 goals) and 1947 (14 goals). He was much more successful in hockey, winning seven national championships (1948-52, and 1955-56) and topping the scoring list regularly, averaging nearly two goals a game during his career. He was the best goal scorer at the Soviet Championships in 1948 (52 goals), 1951 (42 goals) and 1952 (37 goals). He played most of his career from 1947-57 with CSKA Moskva, with a brief interlude in VVS Moskva from 1951-53. On the national ice hockey team, he played 59 games and scored 94 goals, winning the 1954 and 1956 World Championships and 1956 Olympics along the way. He was second at the 1955 and 1957 World Championships, also winning European Championships from 1954-56. He was selected as the best forward at the 1954 World Championships and was the best goal scorer at the 1956 Olympics (9 goals, with Canadian Gerry Théberge) and 1957 World Championships (13 goals).

After débuting internationally at the Sydney Olympics at the age of 17 (claiming a silver medal in the 200 m backstroke behind Lenny Krayzelburg), Aaron Peirsol won five Olympic gold medals, 10 long-course World Championships, and another 6 in the short course pool. Peirsol won the backstroke double (100 and 200 m) at the 2004 Olympics, as well as the 2003 and 2005 World Championships, adding golds in the medley relay each time. Peirsol’s second gold in Athens, in the 200 m, was won with an overwhelming 2.5 second margin over second-placed Markus Rogan. However, when the results popped onto the screen, Peirsol was shown as having been disqualified, supposedly for having made an improper turn. However, the lane judge filed the violation incorrectly, and within half an hour the decision was overturned. This then prompted protests from the Austrians (for Rogan) and British (for 4th place James Goddard), but these were denied by the FINA.

She participated in only one world championship in 1913 in her native Stockholm, placing sixth as the third best Swede. Therefore, her Olympic victory seven years later came as a surprise. It was the only time in history that an Olympic gold medal winner in figure skating was not placed first by any of the judges. Just before her free skating performance she had to change her intended music. Julin had prepared to free skate to the waltz “The Blue Danube” by Johann Strauss. However, she was not allowed to use this music due to wide spread anti-German resentments. She was also four months pregnant when competing in 1920. Julin worked as a waitress and later first ran a café and then a restaurant until she was 77-years-old. She was married to the sea captain F. E. Julin, who was 15 years older. She had two sons and spent her last years in a nursing home in Stockholm. In April 1990 her last appearance on ice was during the formal opening of the ice rink in Östersund at the age of 95.

A forward, he played in over 300 games and scored over 500 goals in the Czech Leagues, always playing in Prague, mostly with LTC Praha, then later in his career with TJ Spartak Praha Sokolova and ČKD Praha. His extremely long career lasted from 1936-65. His career was suspended, however, from 1960-63, after he was found to have been involved in a gambling scandal. In addition to his two World titles, Zábrodský skated for the Czechoslovak team that won a silver medal at the 1948 Winter Olympics. Zábrodský was capped 93 times, scoring 158 international goals. He was the brother of Oldřich Zábrodský who played on the 1948 Olympic team with him. In 1950, Vladimír Zábrodský and 11 of his teammates were arrested by Czechoslovakian authorities and accused of treason, specifically that they were planning on defecting at the World Championships that year. The other 11 teammates were imprisoned, some for up to 14 years, and were tortured and forced to work in uranium mines without protection, likely leading to the death of at least one player, Bohumil Modrý. The fact that Zábrodský, alone among the players, was not found guilty, led to suspicion that he was a spy for the government and possibly even for the KGB. In 1964 Zábrodský emigrated to Sweden where he coached various Swedish hockey clubs, but also coached tennis. Zábrodský had been a top tennis player in Czechoslovakia and had played in some Davis Cup ties. He was runner-up in men’s singles at the 1955 Czechoslovakian Tennis Nationals and made the semi-finals several other times.

64264,Abdul Baser Wasiqi,Male,12 July 1975,,, Afghanistan,AFG,"With a best marathon time of 2-33:21, the 21-year-old Abdul Baser Wasiqi from Afghanistan was all set to compete at the 1992 Barcelona Olympics but, due to the ongoing war in his country, he was unable to participate. However, four years later he was set to make his début, but sadly damaged a hamstring shortly before arriving in Atlanta. However, nothing was going to stop him competing this time. Just over three kilometres into the race, Wasiqi was already a full kilometre behind the field as he limped his way around the course. When South Africa’s Josia Thugwane crossed the finish line in first place, Wasiqi had just passed the 25-kilometre mark but, along the route, he attracted a lot of attention from spectators willing him on. When Wasiqi finally limped into the Olympic stadium, volunteers were preparing for the closing ceremony and they cut a piece of white plastic tape, wrote “Atlanta 1996” on it, and stretched it across the track. Hundreds of volunteers lined the track, and having persuaded the band to stop their rehearsal, applauded the Afghan runner while he inched painfully to the finish. Wasiqi finished 111th, nearly an hour and a half behind the 110th man Abdi Isak of Somalia. Wasiqi’s time of 4-24:17 was the slowest in Olympic marathon history, but he immortalised the Olympic spirit. Personal Best: Mar – unknown.",

In 1886 he became an apprentice to a local oil painter and later went to Tokyo, where he became ill and then returned to his home region. In 1900 Kosugi returned to Tokyo and had his first exhibition in 1904 with the Pacific Ocean artists’ association. He also started to draw illustrations and cartoons for various magazines. With the beginning of the Russo-Japanese War in 1905 Kosugi went to the battlefields as a war correspondent. In 1913 he went to France for one year, while in 1920 he left the Japanese Art Conservatory and started using pseudonyms, mostly Misai Kosugi. In 1929 he travelled to China and became a member of the Imperial Art Academy in 1935. During World War II Kosugi had to be evacuated from Tokyo to the Niigata Prefecture, because his house was destroyed in an air raid. Kosugi’s initial works show a trend towards Oriental romanticism. He later incorporated the art nouveau style, bringing together elements of Western and Eastern styles. He was a versatile sportsman, playing tennis and baseball and practicing karate, and was also known as a writer of a songbook and essays. His entry may be identical to a drawing shown on a Chinese postcard titled Cuju Composition. Cuju was a traditional Chinese soccer game. Its Chinese characters largely correspond to those of rugby. On the postcard, the sport can clearly be identified as rugby.",

97018,Birger Ruud,Male,23 August 1911,,, Norway,NOR,"Birger Ruud is regarded by many ski historians as among the best ski jumpers of all time. Together with his elder brother Sigmund Ruud and younger brother Asbjørn Ruud he dominated international ski jumping for almost two decades. In addition to his Olympic victories in 1932 and 1936 and his silver medal in 1948, he was World Champion three times, in 1931, 1935 and 1937, and silver medalist in 1939. Surprisingly enough, he was national champion only once (1939) and had only one victory at Holmenkollen (1934). Birger Ruud set two world distance records in ski jumping, in 1931 and 1934, jumping 92 metres at Planica, Yugoslavia in 1934. He was also a top alpine skier. In addition to his victory in the downhill combined at the 1936 Winter Olympics, he won the bronze medal in Alpine Combined at the 1935 World Championships. During World War II, Ruud was imprisoned by German forces in 1943 for publicly announcing his anti-Nazi sentiments. After his release in 1944 he joined the Norwegian resistance movement. He ran a ski factory in his hometown Kongsberg, and together with his friend and Olympic ski jumping champion from 1948, Petter Hugsted, took the initiative to create the Kongsberg Ski Museum. In 1987, a sculpture of him was set up in Kongsberg. He was supposed to light the Olympic flame at the 1994 Lillehammer Winter Olympics, but had to withdraw due to heart problems.

46990,Jean Caplin,Female,21 February 1930,,, Great Britain,GBR,"Jean Caplin was born into a seemingly wealthy German family but was fostered by a couple in Brighton in the mid-1930s, as her mother was unmarried. She started swimming at the age of seven, but at the same time experienced a period of tumult in her youth when she was taken to live with her birth mother (whom she garnered “no natural affection” towards), who had recently married a man named Caplin. Returning to her foster family, the Taylors, at age 11, she saw great success in swimming over the next four years, and essentially had the world at her feet. Six years later, that world fell about when she was sent to prison following a theft charge. Just a few months before her 16th birthday, Caplin won the 1946 ASA 200 yards breaststroke title. She had another podium finish in 1947, and in 1948 took part in the London Olympics, reaching the 200 metres breaststroke semi-final. She finished third in the ASA 200 in 1949, and also won the Southern Counties 100 in 1949 and 1950, but then suffered a downturn of form, particularly in 1951 when she started suffering from mental health issues. She took part in the 1952 Olympic qualifiers but was not selected. However, she did go to the Helsinki Games, as a spectator, and made her own way there by hitchhiking from France. When Caplin returned, she had no money or employment, and turned to petty theft, which was ironic because she once turned down a massive £300-a-week to do stunt swimming for a film company, so as to preserve her amateur status. In December 1952, she was sentenced to two six month prison terms, to run consecutively, on 13 counts of theft. She served only three weeks before the sentence was commuted on appeal, to two years’ probation, but with the stipulation she spent 12 months in hospital for specialist treatment. Upon her release she resided in Richmond, Surrey and later became involved with swimming once again in the late 1980s, competing in the Sussex Masters Championships. She donated the Jean Caplin Cup to her former club, Brighton Dolphin, which is presented each year to the most improved breaststroker. In her later years, Caplin continued to keep in touch with her contemporaries, attending a 2012 reunion of athletes who competed at the 1948 London Olympics. She continued to reside in Richmond until her health began to decline, and died from cancer in 2014.","Listed in Olympians Who Were Sent to Prison (Sentenced to two six month terms, to run consecutively, on 15 December 1952, on 13 counts of theft.

Educated at Stowe School, and then Trinity College, Cambridge, he was still at school when, as a 16-year-old, he finished second in the 1934 British Championship to Graham Sharp, and was sixth in the European Championships. He was again runner-up to Sharp in the British Championship in 1935 and was fourth at the Europeans, after originally being placed third, but was relegated following an objection to the accuracy of the marking by Germany’s Ernst Baier was upheld. Dunn finished runner-up to the legendary champion Karl Schäfer, however, at that year’s World Championships. It was certainly a memorable 12 months for Dunn in 1935 as he went up to Cambridge that year, and also obtained his pilot’s license, all at the age of 18. Dunn finished fourth at the 1936 World Championships and, after the Berlin Olympics, where he finished sixth, he turned professional and skated with Sonia Henie at ice carnivals in the United States. They were very close friends and were linked romantically. It was also thought that they would become the Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers on ice. Later in 1936, Dunn was offered a one-year film contract by Universal that was worth £6,500. Despite not making a movie for them, he signed a contract with Paramount the following year. He was lined up to make three Paramount movies; “Everybody’s Girl”, alongside Randolph Scott; “The Duke of West Point”; and a bio-pic about the legendary Hollywood star Rudolf Valentino, because of his uncanny likeness to the late star. Sadly, Dunn never made any of those films because, in July 1938, he contracted a disease associated with coming in contact with rabbits, and after just over a week in hospital, and four blood transfusions, he passed away at the age of 21. Ironically, he died on the very day he should have started filming “The Duke of West Point”. His funeral service at the Catholic Church of the Good Shepherd in Beverly Hills was attended my many movie stars, and one of his pall bearers was Errol Flynn. Dunn was laid to rest at the Calvary Cemetery in Los Angeles.",Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the World Figure Skating Championships (0–1–0 1935 Budapest silver: singles)

Millar is perhaps best known, however, for attending a record ten editions of the Olympic Games since 1972, being absent only from the 1980 Summer Olympics due to Canada’s boycott. His only medal, silver in the team jumping tournament, came at the 2008 Summer Olympics, but brought him a level of national fame not normally seen for Canadians in the sport.

A defeat to Mockridge in the Australian championships appeared to cost Cox a place at the Helsinki Olympics but a fine run of form gave him a berth to Finland where he would compete in both the sprint and the tandem events.

Once World War II ended, Saidelli spent a brief period in the Veneto region, then in Roma, and finally in Genova where his father Alfredo began to collaborate with the historic maritime agency Oceania. Gigi attended the Arecco Jesuit school and continued the sport he had started a few years earlier, by sailing in Genoese waters. In 1955, at the age of 16, Saidelli travelled around the world alone on board a cargo ship. Despite having a serious disability in one eye, Saidelli managed to compete at the 1964 Tokyo Olympics in the Star class with Luigi Croce where they finished a disappointing 15th place overall following a mechanical incident. Saidelli graduated in economics and commerce in 1963 with a thesis focused on the collision between the Italian liner Andrea Doria and the Swedish vessel Stockholm, which occurred in 1956. He was married in 1966 and, with his wife and two children, they spent long periods in the Caribbean, South Africa, and Greenland. At the end of his sporting career, Saidelli embraced his entrepreneurial career, continuing to bond with the sea when he embarked on a career as a shipping agent and founded a shipping agency bearing his name, with his time being spent mainly between Genova and Savona, the cities that adopted his refugee family.

From 1945, Rodrigues worked for an agency for artistic advertising in Lisboa, where the influence of neorealism in his work became evident. From 1948, he produced various works for the National Information Secretariat (SNI) in the studio of Manuel Rodrigues. These works correlated with the modernist movement and the “culture of good taste” that characterized the cultural production of the dictatorial “Estado Novo” in Portugal after 1940. In 1954, he spent one year in Brazil. Sebastião Rodrigues worked in advertising, designed exhibitions and took on the graphic design of books. Together with other artists, he also worked for the magazine Almanaque. He largely retained his modernist style over the course of time. In 1976, Rodrigues was a founding member of the Portuguese Designers Association. He participated in numerous exhibitions and received several awards.

After the War, Adlard returned to his old hockey form, but a further injury in an England trial meant he missed the 1948 International season. He was, however, selected for the Great Britain team at the London Olympics, where he scored five goals, including both goals in the 2-0 semi-final win over Pakistan, which put Britain into their first final since 1920. Away from hockey, Adlard was the fourth-generation member of his family to run the local paper mill. He was also a fine all-round sportsman, and was captain and honorary secretary of the Winchcombe Cricket Club.",

In 1925 he became the pianist of Louis II, Prince of Monaco, and musical teacher of his children with a residence in the palace. In 1938, he moved to Monte Carlo permanently. His compositions included songs and stage works. Barthélemy won the 1912 Olympic music gold medal for his Olympic Triumph March.

58232,Sam Rabin,Male,20 June 1903,,, Great Britain,GBR,"Sam Rabin was equally at home on the wrestling mat as he was at his artist’s easel, sculpturing, teaching art, acting, or singing. The son of two Russian-Jewish exiles, Rabin was born Samuel Rabinovitch in the Cheetham area of Manchester. At the age of 11 he won a scholarship to the Manchester Municipal School of Art, despite his ambition to become the strongest man in the world at that early age. He became the youngest person ever to attend the college, where one of his fellow students was the famous Manchester painter L. S. Lowry. Rabin then studied at the Slade School of Fine Art in London from 1921-24, and then in Paris in 1925. Whilst at the Slade, nearby was the Holborn Stadium and Backfriars Ring, where he could follow his other pursuits of wrestling, and occasionally boxing. In 1925, the year he also studied in Paris, Rabin reached the middleweight final at the British Amateur Wrestling Championships, only to lose to Edgar Bacon. Rabin was selected for the 1928 Amsterdam Olympics where he won a bronze medal. In the same year that he appeared in the Amsterdam Games, Rabin was part of a group of sculptors, including Henry Moore, who created stonework for the headquarters of the London Underground. In 1930, Rabin stood 27m (90ft) above London’s Fleet Street to produce two sculptures on the façade of the Daily Telegraph building. Knowing he was going to struggle to fund his art ambitions, Rabin turned to professional wrestling and fought in the early-1930s under the names as “Rabin the Cat” and “Sam Radnor – the Hebrew Jew”. He also had a spell in the movies, and in 1933 wrestled with Charles Laughton (as Henry VIII) in “The Private Life of Henry VIII”. He also played the part of the Jewish bare-knuckle boxer Daniel Mendoza in the film “Scarlet Pimpernel”. During World War II, Rabin entertained troops by singing at British Army camps. After the War, he sang regularly on the BBC radio programme “Time for Music” with the London Studio Players. Rabin gave up singing and sculpturing to concentrate on drawing, with the boxing ring and its characters as the subject of most of his pieces. In 1949 Rabin became a teacher of drawing at Goldsmiths’ College School of Art in London and his pupils included painter Tom Keating (famous for producing fake works), fashion designer Mary Quant, and Op-artist Bridget Riley. Rabin became disillusioned with what he was doing at Goldsmiths’, however, and in 1965 moved to the Bournemouth College of Art for the next 20 years, and from 1985, until shortly before his death in 1991, he worked at the Poole Art Centre.",

The design for the Great (Olympic) Stadium of Beograd dates back to 1947, when the team was awarded the first prize of a tender. The stadium was to be built in the Beograd district of Banjica to accommodate 80,000 spectators. The design was characterized by two semicircular opposite shells and tried to reconcile the theoretical and technical requirements. However, the project did not go beyond the planning phase. Neidhardt received another honorable mention for his work Project for Stadium for Zagreb in the same category solely with Turina. The football stadium in Zagreb is the largest in the city and named after the district in which it is located, Maksimir Stadium. Located on the site of an old stadium from 1912, it was built in the late 1940s according to plans by Neidhardt and Turina from 1946. Except for the catalog of the art exhibition, most sources also mention Eugen Erlich as the third architect. Over a period of 15 years, sections of the building were completed successively. The entire complex also included a second, smaller stadium, a swimming pool, a sports hall and the corresponding infrastructure. In 1998, a major refurbishment of the stadium began, but could not be completed. Later, the original capacity of 64,000 spectators had to be reduced significantly due to the installation of seats. In 2011, further minor improvements were made. Neidhardt mainly built sport stadiums. His better known brother Juraj (1901-1979) worked with Le Corbusier during 1930s.",

In 1908 he could not quite reproduce his form of earlier years at the Olympic Games. He was killed in action while serving as a gunner with the Royal Field Artillery. Butterfield’s brother Alfred was also killed in action four months earlier. At the time of his death, George was the manager of the Hole in the Wall Hotel in Darlington, and it was reported that in his racing days he used to train by running against a local greyhound.

At the age of 15 he started to compete in local competitions organized by the Worker’s Sport Union. He excelled both in cross-country and ski jumping, moved to the town of Mo i Rana and became a member of the club Stålkameratene. In 1939 he won the Worker’s Sport Union Championships for Norway in Nordic combined, but had no competitions in the following years due to World War II. In 1947, aged 29, he made a strong comeback and won the Norwegian Championships in Nordic combined. The year after he was not selected for the Olympic team, but after the Olympics he won at Holmenkollen, beating all members of the Norwegian Olympic team and also the silver medalist from St. Moritz, the Finn Martti Huhtala. He then emerged as the top Norwegian Nordic combined skier for the following seasons, winning the National Championship in 1949 and 1951 and Holmenkollen in 1950 and 1951. After his third victory at Holmenkollen in 1951 he was awarded the Holmenkollen medal. In 1950 he won the bronze medal at the World Championships in Lake Placid. With the defending champion Heikki Hasu, Slåttvik was favored for 1952 Winter Olympic gold, but started badly with a fall on his first jump in the ski jumping part in the competition. With two jumps out of three counting, he came strongly back and won the jumping with a clear margin over Hasu. The Finn had to beat him by 4:32 minutes in the cross-country portion, but Slåttvik skied the race of his life, coming in third in the combined race, only 3:16 minutes behind Hasu. Slåttvik continued to compete after his Olympic victory, winning his fourth national title in 1953 and placing fifth at the 1954 World Championships, and competed past the age of 40. He moved to Lillehammer in the early 50s, married and had two sons, the youngest of whom was named Heikki after his main rival and friend Heikki Hasu. He ran a kiosk in Lillehammer until his retirement. Slåttvik was a very popular athlete, his fans appreciating his energy and relaxed attitude. He was not so fond of hard training, but a great natural talent who could relax after his competitions smoking a cigarette.",Listed in Olympians Who Were Awarded the Holmenkollmedaljen (1951) Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the World Nordic Ski Championships (0–0–1 1950 Lake Placid/Rumford NCB bronze: individual)

However, the long-time captain of the German national team was not without controversy. His penchant for good food and alcohol meant that he gained weight over time, and was criticized for his lack of self-control. Finally in 1928 his intemperance led to the end of his national team career. Kalb earned 15 international caps and scored two goals. He was a dentist by profession and also worked as a trainer (1936-39 at 1.FC Nürnberg), becoming German Champion again in 1936. Kalb died in the last days of World War II due to blood poisoning.",

Educated at Harrow School, his finest sporting moment, apart from taking part in the Olympics, was probably playing in the final of the 1956 Public Schools’ Golf Competition, when he was Harrow’s only winner in a 4-1 defeat by Stowe. Deen never needed to work, having inherited his grandfather’s fortune, although he did spend a while as a Lloyds underwriter at the time of his appearance in the 1972 Winter Olympics. A playboy, Deen was known as the “Last of the Dame Hunters,” whose life was one long party. He was once the subject of the TV documentary “Rupert Goes to Town”, which was about the privileged world of Deen and his friends. He was also once filmed on Yorkshire Television, sat in a bubble-filled bath drinking a Bloody Mary cocktail, served by his butler. Derogatory comments about coalminers, working class people, women, and people in general during the programme led to him having to seek police protection. Extremely flamboyant, Deen once booked a cruise for friends and then asked them to pay for it, as he did when he threw a lavish party for his 40th birthday, when he asked the invitees to pay £30 a head. Amongst friends of Deen, and his family, was the famous 1960s call-girl Christine Keeler, who regularly visited the Deen household in Southern France. Deen was also the owner of several racehorses, including one called “The Happy Hooker” in the mid-1970s.. Following his death, his friend Algy Cluff commented on Deen’s luge career by saying: “This was entirely suited to Rupert’s requirements, since it is the only sport with the participant lying flat on his back.” Deen himself said, after finishing in last place, after his first two runs at Sapporo in 1972: “Tiring work this tobogganing.”",

Although reigning European 100 free champion, Csík was not considered among the favorites to win the title at the Olympics, those roles going to world record holder American Peter Fick and strong Japanese swimmers Masanori Yusa, Shigeo Arai and Masaharu Taguchi. At the Olympic final, as the favorites battled each other, Csík came through in the outside lane to finish ahead of three Japanese swimmers, while Fick finished a disappointing sixth. Csík also win bronze in the 4x200 free relay at the 1936 Olympics.

Csik was the youngest of three brothers, whose father was killed during the first months of the World War I. Coached by István Bárány and József Vértesy, Csík became the top Hungarian freestyle swimmer in the 1930s. He first competed internationally at the 1933 World University Games, where he won 100 freestyle silver and 50 free bronze. The next year, Csík won the 100 free and 4x200 free relay at the 1934 European Championships. In 1935, Csík won the 100 free, 4x200 free relay, and medley relay at the World University Games and after his Olympic triumph, Csík last competed internationally at the 1937 World University Games, winning the 100 free, 200 breast, 4x200 free relay, and medley relay. Domestically Csík was a 19-time Hungarian champion – 1933-38 in 100 freestyle; 1934-36 in 200 freestyle; 1935-36 in 100 breaststroke; 1935 in 200 breaststroke; 1937 in 300 IM; 1934-37 and 1939 in 4x200 freestyle relay; and 1937 in the medley relay.

Csík graduated from the Pázmány Péter University in 1937 with an MD degree and retired from international competition, concentrating on his work at the Pázmány Péter University and MÁV Betegbiztosító clinics in Budapest, but he continued to compete domestically, winning his final medals at the Hungarian championships in 1942. In 1943, Csík taught anatomy at the Budapest University of Physical Education and also worked as an editor of the Hungarian medical journal Orvosi Közlemények.

But her participation in those Olympics almost didn’t happen. Just 17 days before the USA Olympic Trials in May 1984, Benoit underwent arthroscopic knee surgery and her status was suspect. With a gritty performance she won the Trials in a respectable time of 2:31:04. That determination continued on in Los Angeles, where the marathon started out slowly in the high August heat and humidity of Southern California, and by 25km Benoit had almost a two-minute lead. With no last minute challenges, Benoit ran the rest of the race relaxed and entered the Los Angeles Coliseum 400m ahead of Norway’s Grete Waitz. Knowing her life would change forever, this quiet, shy American captured Olympic glory on American soil in a time of 2:24:52. After retiring from competitive running, Benoit has written books, opened a running clinic, coached, done motivational speaking, worked as a sports commentator and started a road race (Beach to Beacon 10K Road Race) which attracts world class runners. She has also continued to still run including such prestigious marathons as New York City and Chicago, setting age group records along the way. In 2009, she broke the 50+ division record with a final time of 2:49:09 in the New York City Marathon. In October 2010, she ran the Chicago Marathon in 2:47:50 finishing 43rd - the site of her American record 25 years earlier—missing her goal of qualifying for an eighth Olympic Marathon Team Trials race by 1:50, but recording the fastest-ever performance by a woman over the age of 52.

A lifelong member of Íþróttafélag Reykjavíkur, he won his first major accolade in 1946 as a member of the handball team that captured that year’s national championships. In 1954 he accomplished a similar feat as a basketball player, taking home another Icelandic title. His most important international appearance, however, came in-between these two events, when he was selected to represent Iceland in track and field at the 1948 Summer Olympics. At the Games, he was eliminated in round one of both the 100 metres event and, alongside Ásmundur Bjarnason, Trausti Eyjólfsson, and Haukur Clausen, the 4x100 metres relay. He also competed in the long jump, where he was eliminated in the qualifying round after placing 14th. Finnbjörn finished sixth in the 100 metres and reached the semifinals of the 200 metres at the 1946 European Championships and competed again in the 100 metres at the 1950 edition. He was Nordic Champion in the 100 and 200 metres events in 1949 and was also active as a gymnast during this period.

The bronze sculpture The Decathlete, a result of this collaboration, stands since almost 70 years at the Berlin Olympic Stadium. Lemperle was also successful professionally. He studied at the German Sport University in Köln, and then went to the Wilhelm Humboldt University of Berlin in 1932 to study art history. After receiving his PhD, with a thesis on Upper Swabian Baroque Monasteries in its Relation to the Landscape, Lemperle served on the university’s scientific staff until the outbreak of World War II.

901652,Nicola Pietrangeli,Male,11 September 1933,,, Italy,ITA,"Nikki Pietrangeli is considered to be the greatest Italian tennis player of all-time and was the first Italian to win a Grand Slam singles title, winning the French Championship two years in succession, 1959-60. He was the son of an Italian father and Russian mother and was born in Tunisia. He grew up in Roma and began to play tennis relatively late because his first sporting passion was football. He learned to play tennis without professional coaching and his instinct for the game, as well as his technical skills, saw him develop a backhand pass that was one of the best seen in the game at the time. The Italian press of the day called it Il rovescio di Dio (The backhand of God). Pietrangeli burst onto the scene as an 18-year-old when he won the Italian Youth Championship, and remained at the top of Italian tennis for more than 20 years, and at the age of 40 reached the final of the Italian Championship at Perugia before handing over the mantle to Adriano Panatta. Pietrangeli was loved by fans for his charisma and pleasant manner, and they appreciated his elegant style and talent, including his skilful use of the drop shot. Pietrangeli was comfortable on clay and appeared in four men’s singles finals at Roland Garros, winning against the South African Ian Vermaak in four sets in 1959, and the following year by beating the Chilean Luis Ayala in five sets. Pietrangeli was runner-up in 1961 and 1964, beaten both times by Spain’s Manolo Santana. Pietrangeli also won the French men’s doubles title in 1959 with Orlando Sirola, and the mixed doubles in 1958 with the British woman Shirley Bloomer. At Wimbledon, Pietrangeli was a singles semi-finalist in 1960, when he lost to the phenomenal Australian Rod Laver after five sets (4-6, 6-3, 8-10, 6-2, 6-4). Pietrangeli won the Italian Open in 1957 and 1961 and was ranked world number three in 1959-60 by the journalist Lance Tingay. Pietrangeli won three times on the clay court at Monte Carlo (1961, 1967-68) and also won at Hamburg, Buenos Aires, Rio de Janeiro and Palermo. In addition, he won the 1963 Mediterranean Games singles title at Napoli, beating Santana in five sets. He also won the doubles bronze medal with Sirola, in a tournament won by Niki Pilic and Bora Jovanovic from Yugoslavia. Between 1955-72 Pietrangeli won a record 24 Italian Championships (seven singles, 16 doubles and one mixed doubles). He competed in 43 Grand Slam tournaments between 1954-72 (19 French Open, 19, Wimbledon, four US Open and one Australian Open). Pietrangeli represented Italy in the Davis Cup in a record 164 matches between 1954-72, winning 120 of them. He appeared in two finals (1960 and 1961), losing on both occasions to Australia, at Sydney (1-4), and Melbourne (0-5) respectively, whose team was made up of the formidable trio of Laver, Roy Emerson and Neale Fraser. After his active career as a player, Pietrangeli became Italy’s Davis Cup team captain on 11 occasions and guided them to their first-ever triumph in 1976 when Adriano Panatta, Corrado Barazzutti, Paolo Bertolucci and Tonino Zugarelli beat Chile 4-1 at Santiago. With the same players a year later, Italy lost the final in Australia. Outside sport, Pietrangeli, the father of three sons, was an actor and appeared in two films in the 1980s, La donna giusta by Paul Williams, and with Virna Lisi and Clio Goldsmith, and C’era un castello con 40 cani by Duccio Tessari, with Peter Ustinov. Pietrangeli spoke fluent English, Spanish, French and Russian, and lived in Monte Carlo. In 1961 he became a Commander of the Italian Republic and in 1964 was awarded the athletic valour gold medal for exceptional merits. He was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in 1986, and in 2006 the Italian Olympic committee, following a request by the Italian Tennis Federation (FIT), named the old tennis stadium at Foro Italico, Roma, in his honour. He is one of very few tennis players to have received such an honour while still living.","Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the Mediterranean Games (1–0–1 1963 Napoli TEN gold: singles, bronze: doubles) Listed in Olympians Who Received the Italian Olympic Association (CONI) Gold Medal ()"

With Werner Camichel replacing Forster, the quartet came in third at the 1973 European Championships, but defended their crown at that year’s World Championships. Sepp Benz then took Stadler’s spot and the foursome captured the 1975 World Championships and came in third at the 1976 European Championships. Erich and Peter Schärer, meanwhile, took gold in the two-man at that year’s European Championships. Erich and Benz also attended the 1976 Winter Olympics, where they earned a bronze medal in the two-man and, with Ueli Bächli and Ruedi Marti, silver in the four-man.

Schärer, Bächli, Trachsel and the non-Olympian Max Rüegg also captured silver at the 1979 European Championships. In the two-man event, Schärer and Benz won the 1978 and 1979 World Championships, while Schärer and Bächli earned silver and bronze at the 1979 and 1980 European Championships respectively. Marti returned to the four-man team and helped them win the 1980 European Championships and take silver at that year’s Winter Olympics. Schärer and Benz, meanwhile, captured Olympic gold in the two-man. Schärer continued his success over the next few years. At the 1981 World Championships he and Benz came in third in both the two- and four-man events, the latter with Max and non-Olympian Tony Rüegg. Schärer earned his final European Championship medal, gold, with Max Rüegg in 1982, and together they won the event at that year’s World Championships. With Tony and non-Olympian Franz Isenegger, the duo also captured bronze in the four-man. Schärer won silver in the two-man with Max Rüegg at the 1983 World Championships, and his final major international medal came at the 1986 World Championships, where he won the four-man alongside Erwin Fassbind, Kurt Meier, and the non-Olympian André Kisser.

Sartori followed this by setting a world record with a time of 1:04.61 in Roma, then winning the test event on the Olympic track in Mexico City. Unsurprisingly Sartori was considered one of the favourites for the 1968 Olympics but, given an unfavourable draw, he only finished fourth. A month later at the World Championships in Montevideo he captured the bronze medal. The biggest moment of Sartori’s cycling career came in August 1969 at the World Track Championships in Brno, Czechoslovakia where he took the gold medal with the time of 1:08.38 ahead of the Pole Janusz Kierzkowski and the Dutchman Klaas Balk. In this race the favourite, the Frenchman Daniel Morelon, could only finish sixth, while the eventual 1972 Olympic champion Niels Fredborg was fourth. For Sartori this was his last important international event but domestically he would win national titles in 1970 and 1971 and two bronze medals in 1972-73.

Two such raids on enemy ships won wing-commander Gadd the DFC in 1944, and the following year, a Bar was added.

70502,Carl Schuhmann,Male,12 May 1869,159.0,70, Germany,GER,"Only six athletes have competed in four Olympic sports: three of them did so at the 1896 Olympics (with low participations), and three participated in four different skiing disciplines. The most successful of this sextet is Carl Schuhmann. The German was first and foremost a gymnast. He won three first prizes in Athens, individually in the horse vault, and twice with the German team. With the exception of rope climbing, he competed in all gymnastic events. After their return home, most team participants were excluded from the reactionary German Gymnastics Association as they were “involved in a sporting event dedicated to internationalism.” The winning teams were banned from national competitions in Berlin. His second sport was wrestling. In the small field of five, the native Berliner competed against home favorite Tsitas. The final lasted for forty minutes when it had to be postponed due to darkness setting in. The following morning, Schuhmann decided the contest in his favor, but he remained very popular with the Greek public. The tiny (1.58 m) Schuhmann further competed in weightlifting and athletics, but did not place among the first three. The 1896 Olympics were the biggest success in Schuhmann’s career, although he had several good showings at the annual German Turnfest. He did remain involved in the Olympics, visiting Athens for a second time in 1906 as a guest of honor and German team leader. Two years later, he was Germany’s team attaché in London, the city where had been a gymnastics teacher since 1898. One of his pupils, Otto Bauscher, represented Great Britain at the 1908 Games. His final Olympic appearance was in 1936, when he was even part of a gymnastics exhibition and tribute in the Olympic Stadium, despite being well into his 60s.

Four years later Mattila competed at the Olympics again, finishing 10th in the 18 km race. The year 1928 was also probably Mattila’s best as a competitive skier.

While Masanori Yusa, Masaharu Taguchi, and Shigeo Arai all beat pre-race favorite Peter Fick, the gold went to Ferenc Csík of Hungary. While Arai was awarded the bronze, it is possible he was fortunate to earn a medal at all; photographic evidence does not fully match the official times. Because of their excellent results, the three Japanese swimmers, with the addition of Shigeo Sugiura, were the clear favorites for the 4x200 m relay event. They dominated the competition, lowering the world record in the process. Due to the political situation and lack of international events, Arai never again swam outside of Japan, but he continued to be a force there. Between 1937 and 1940, he won three Japanese 100 metre freestyle titles, four in the 200 m, and one in the 400 m. He had won his first championship, however, in 1932 in the 100 free.

A specialist in the 3,000m relay, she spent the next two years competing internationally for her country and won a gold medal in the event at the 1993 World Championships alongside teammates, Nathalie Lambert, Isabelle Charest, and Angela Cutrone. At the 1994 Winter Olympics Cutrone was replaced by Sylvie Daigle and the Canadians took home a 3,000m relay silver medal from the tournament. Boudrais’ medal was stolen in November of that year, while it was on display an Olympic Stadium sports show, but it was recovered the next day following an anonymous tip that had been sent to Le Journal de Montreal. Boudrais continued her regimen of international competition, which included another 3,000m relay gold at the 1994 World Championships and several World Cup victories, and found success nationally as well, placing third overall in the 1997 Canadian Championships.

He also won the AAU high jump and pole vault that year. The American team for the Paris Olympics stopped off for the British AAA Championships and Baxter took the high jump at 6-2 (1.88). At the Paris Games he jumped marginally higher and won the Olympic gold medal at 6-2½ (1.89). Later the same day, he won the pole vault in somewhat bizarre circumstances. Daniel Horton and Bascom Johnson, who had both beaten Baxter at the British meet, were missing, as was Charles Dvorak, who would become Olympic champion in 1904. Johnson and Dvorak had left the grounds on being told that the pole vault had been postponed, and Horton declined to compete on sabbatical grounds. Notwithstanding the information given to Johnson and Dvorak, the event was held as scheduled and Baxter, who was still at the field after his high jump victory, registered as a last-minute entry and won his second Olympic title. The following day he finished second to Ray Ewry in all three standing jumps, thus winning a total of five Olympic medals in the space of two days. In 1901, Baxter returned to England where he successfully defended his British high jump title but, as at the Olympics, he was involved in drama surrounding the pole vault. Baxter had arrived at the Championships without a pole and as the only other competitor refused to lend him his, Baxter uprooted a flagpole, cleared the same height as his rival, and shared the British championship. Baxter was admitted to the New York State Bar in 1901 and in 1903 he was chosen as a special city judge on the Democratic ticket. Apart from a break during World War I, he continued in private law practice until 1921, when he was appointed Commissioner of the Northern District of New York. In 1925 he resigned and returned to private practice. Personal Bests: HJ – 6-3½ (1.918) (1900); PV – 3.35 (1900).",

Cranz did not compete in the 1936 championships, although she did win the inaugural Olympic title that season. In 1941, Cranz won three more world titles, but this tournament in Cortina d’Ampezzo was declared unofficial by the FIS in 1946, citing lack of Allied participation (only four nations took part). Even without these titles, Cranz’s total of 15 World Championship medals remains unapproached as of 2016, with Anja Pärson coming closest with 13 and Kjetil André Aamodt with 12. Born in Brussels, her parents fled to Reutlingen during World War I. Cranz later became the poster girl of the “Bund Deutscher Mädchen (BDM)” which was the Nazi organisation for young girls. In 1943, Cranz married ace fighter pilot Adolf Borchers. Following the war, after spending time in a forced labor camp, the couple settled in Steibis, a Bavarian village near the Austrian border. For four decades, they ran a skiing school there. In 1956 and 1960 she was the coach of the German national team, and in 1960 and 1964 she served as a skiing judge at the Olympics. In 1991 she was inducted to the Hall of Fame of the International Foundation of Women’s Sport in New York.","Sister of Rudi Cranz Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the World Alpine Ski Championships (12–3–0 1934 St. Moritz gold: slalom and combined, silver: downhill; 1935 Mürren gold: downhill and combined, silver: slalom; 1937 Chamonix gold: downhill, slalom, and combined; 1938 Engelberg gold: slalom and combined, silver: downhill; 1939 Zakopane gold: downhill, slalom, and combined; 1941 Cortina d'Ampezzo gold: downhill and combined, bronze: slalom (unofficial)) Listed in Olympic Alpine Skiers - Gold Medalists and World Champions; Same Discipline - Different Event (Combined: Olympic Gold - 1936, World Champion - 1934/1935/1937/1938/1939)"

His Real Madrid team was facing Ignis in Varese in the European Cup with the score tied at 80 with only two seconds remaining. Real Madrid had little chance in overtime as their top scorer had fouled out and two other starters were injured. Realizing that a big loss in overtime would hurt their points differential, their coach, Pedro Ferrándiz, instructed Alocén to score a basket in Ignis’s goal. Real Madrid lost by two but with minimal point differential. This led FIBA to punish voluntary self-baskets against with a fine and exclusion from the competition.",

She was European Under-23 champion in 1999 but it still came as a surprise to many when she reached the Olympic final in Sydney. Danvers showed remarkable consistency after Sydney and was a finalist at every major championship over the next three years. She married her coach Darrell Smith, the nephew of acclaimed sprint coach John Smith, and missed a chance at the 2004 Olympics due to the birth of her son. On her return to her track she collected the first major medal of her career, a silver at the 2006 Commonwealth Games and resumed her run of major finals. In the Olympic year of 2008 she struggled with her fitness in the early part of the season but her slightly controversial choice for the Olympic team was vindicated when she ran the fastest time of her career to win the bronze medal.

On each of his three Olympic appearances, he sailed with a different crew but won a medal on each occasion. Pattisson’s first major success came in 1960 when as a 17-year-old he won the world cadet title, with his brother John crewing. In 1968 he won the world and European titles before going on to win an Olympic gold medal with Iain MacDonald-Smith. A second gold followed in 1972 with Christopher Davies as his partner and in 1976 Pattisson took the silver medal with Julian Brooke-Houghton. He was awarded the MBE for his Olympic successes. After his first Olympic victory Pattisson resigned his commission in the Navy and joined a boat building firm in Dorset, which allowed him more time for training than his naval duties had permitted. He consolidated his position as the world’s leading helmsman in the Flying Dutchman class and was the world and European champion from 1968 to 1972. Pattisson built his success on meticulous attention to detail and a dedication to physical fitness; he came closed to making the Olympic team for a fourth time in 1984 in his favorite Flying Dutchman class. Despite his domination of this class, Rodney Pattisson was a versatile sailor and in 1983 was co-skipper of Victory, Peter de Savary’s entry for the America’s Cup.",

His brothers Karl and Paul were also painters. When the bronze statue Relaxation was created in 1936, it was titled In wind and sun.

He was a master engraver, painter, silversmith and calligrapher. Initially, like his father, he worked on the railroads, but then learned lithography and eventually studied at the Royal College of Art. His son, Robert Johnson Washington, became a highly regarded ceramist. In 2014 the Washington Foundation UK was established with the aim of supporting emerging artists to develop their skills. William Washington was only the third artist to become a Master of one of the great City of London companies – the Saddlers. His best-known work was regarded as The Donkey Ride, which contained a portrait of his wife and daughter. He was known as a keen fisherman. The black and white engraving The Cricket Bat Maker was created as early as 1934. The 39.0 x 29.7 cm sheet (27.3 x 21.7 cm image) shows the former player and legendary maker of cricket bats, Walter Warsop, in his workshop in Danbury, Essex.

Individually, he placed 19th. He earned his first major international victory at the 1959 Pan American Games, where he took the gold medal in the three-day event with his brother Norman and Tom Gayford. His next stop, and his final one as an eventer, was the 1960 Summer Olympics, where he and his brother were eliminated after their teammates, Gayford and Herbinson, failed to complete the race. Jim was 10th individually. Jim switched to show jumping after these Games but, because Canada did not send an eventing or jumping equestrian team to the 1964 Summer Olympics, he had to wait until the 1967 Pan American Games to show what he was capable of. After taking bronze in the team event, alongside Gayford and Jim Day, the trio was selected for the 1968 Summer Olympics, where they won a surprise gold medal in team jumping. Individually Elder was sixth after losing a bronze medal jump-off against David Broome of Great Britain, Frank Chapot of the United States, and Hans Günter Winkler of West Germany; it was, however, his best solo rank across five editions of the Games. Elder then won two more team gold medals at the 1970 World Championships (with Day and Gayford) and the 1971 Pan American Games (alongside Gayford, Torchy Millar, and the non-Olympian Barbara Simpson). It was not until the 1972 Summer Olympics, with Day and Torchy and Ian Millar, that he was dethroned, finishing sixth in team jumping and joint-43rd individually. The 1972 Games signaled the end of Elder’s glory days, but he continued to compete through the 1980s and attended two more editions of the Olympics in 1976 and 1984.

Aldo also competed in those events, finishing fifth in the foil and winning silver in the sabre. His father Beppe was a well-known fencer in Italy, with his own fencing school. Together with his older brother Nedo, Aldo learned to fight the foil and sabre, but not the épée. His father considered épée to be an “undisciplined weapon” and forbade his pupils to use it, although the brothers did so in secrecy and eventually won a gold medal in the team épée in Antwerp. Following the 1920 Olympics, Aldo Nadi turned professional, and earned several Italian titles. He eventually moved to the United States, where he was known as a fencing coach to actors, notably Tyrone Power. He also occasionally appeared in moves himself. His most visible appearance was in a non-speaking role as Renard’s bodyguard in the film “To Have and Have Not” with Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Becall. Nadi was known for his duels also outside the fencing hall: at the 1920 Olympics he fought out a strange duel with Filippo Bottino. Having insulted the weightlifting champion, they fought out the fight with a riding whip (Nadi) and a wooden beam (Bottino). It was decided rather soon as Nadi immediately struck Bottino’s hand, causing him to drop the weapon. On another occasion, he challenged a journalist who had mocked him, and severely injured him in the duel. He also once challenged fellow fencing champion Edoardo Mangiarotti to a duel after feeling slighted because Mangiarotti had received a more honorable certificate from the Italian NOC than Nadi had himself. Because of injury, Nadi proposed to fight out the duel with pistols, which was wisely declined by Mangiarotti.","Brother of Nedo Nadi Listed in Olympic Fencers - Winning Gold Medals, Épée/Sabre (1920 Épée, Team; 1920 Sabre, Individual (Silver); 1920 Sabre, Team.)

She was spotted by one of the coaches present and, despite being unable to ski, was awarded a place on the national development squad.

She was able to put two high quality jumps together and finished three points ahead of the field to gain the Olympic title.

To prove that her success was not a one-off she added both World Championship and World Cup titles in 2003 and retained the World Cup in 2004. Illness and injury ruined the 2004-05 season but she returned for 2005-06 and, once again saving her best performance of the season for the Olympics, took the bronze at the Winter Games in Torino.

At the finish it was impossible to tell who had won, and the jury conferenced for 10 minutes before announcing that Germany was the gold medalist. All four track cyclists came from West Germany. After winning the Olympic gold medal the team was honored with the Silver Bay Leaf, the highest sports award in Germany. In 1968, Link returned and reached the final against Denmark in the same event, by then representing West Germany at Mexico City. West Germany always led and the race looked over when, after 9 of 12 laps, a Danish rider went off the back, however, they re-grouped although they still trailed on the bell lap. The German team then began to split, with Jürgen Kissner dropping off the pace. As his teammate Henrichs passed him, Kissner’s hand appeared to touch him, possibly giving him a slight push. Germany held on to win by 3½ seconds, but Kissner was an East German defector and East Germany immediately protested that the touch had been an illegal shove. After a 15-minute conference among the judges, West Germany was disqualified, and Italy and the Soviet Union were announced as the silver and bronze medal winners. FRG officials then protested, stating that Italy and the Soviets should not be placed ahead of their riders. Another long conference ensued, and the result was announced as Denmark 1st and Italy 3rd. No silver medal placement was given until a meeting of the Fédération Internationale Amateur de Cyclisme (FIAC, later the UCI) in November, when West Germany was awarded second place and the silver medals. Since 1965, Link studied sports at the Sports High School in Köln (Cologne). In 1972, he became assistant coach under legendary head coach Gustav Kilian, and in 1985 Link was the secretary of the organizing committee at the Youth Worlds. From 1987-2007 Link was the head of the Olympic training center in Stuttgart.",

Together they were runners-up at their first Canadian Championship together in 1988, in addition to placing 7th at the World Championships and 9th at the 1988 Winter Olympics. The following year they were 7th again at the World Championships, but took the Canadian Championships and would never again fail to see the podium at a Canadian, World or Olympic Championship. The duo took second place at the 1990 World Championships, but slid to third at their national tournament. They regained the Canadian title the following year and held it through 1994. During that time, they won two bronze medals at the Winter Olympics in 1992 and 1994, as well as two more silver medals (1991 and 1994), one bronze (1992), and one gold (1993) at the World Championships. Brassuer and Eisler retired from active competition in 1994, but continued their professional relationship through other channels. Along with a woman by the name of Lou-Anne Brosseau, they formed B.B.E. Productions in 1992, which organized charity figure skating events across Canada to benefit the Children’s Wish Foundation. The organization won several awards, put on over 25 shows, and raised more than a quarter of a million dollars until it ceased operating in 2006. After their second Olympic medal, the duo was awarded the Meritorious Service Decoration in 1994 and was inducted into the Canada Sports Hall of Fame and the Canadian Figure Skating Hall of Fame in 1996 and 2000 respectively.

In 1995 and 1996 he was German youth national champion and in 1998 and 1999 the senior champion. Shortly before the 2000 Olympics Ćatić won the European Championships. Soon after the Olympics, Ćatić turned professional and used the German name Felix Sturm to be better known by a broader audience. He then started an impressive career and won several Professional World Championships. He was WBO middleweight champion, beating Argentinian Héctor Javier Velazco in 2003 and defending the title in 2004 against Spanish boxer Rubén Varón Fernández. In 2004, Ćatić controversially lost the title to the American Oscar De La Hoya, but Sturm was clearly the better boxer on the day. Sturm then won the WBA title in 2006 by beating the American Samoan Maselino Masoe, but he lost the title to Spain’s Francisco Javier Castillejo Rodríguez only four months later. In 2007, Sturm beat Castillejo to regain the WBA title and held it until 2010 when he lost it by default to Gennady Golovkin from Kazakhstan as the WBA declared Sturm as their super-middleweight champion. Sturm defended this title several times until he lost to Australian Daniel Geale in 2012. Sturm then boxed for the IBF middleweight title in 2013 against Britain’s Darren Barker, and lost it to Australian Sam Soliman in 2014. Finally, Sturm won the WBA super-middleweight title against Russian Fyodor Chudinov in 2016, a title he had given up after being suspected of a doping violation. Officially, he declared he was standing down because of elbow injuries. Sturm had several conflicts with the law. In 2005 he was fined 12,500€ after a brawl in a park garage, in 2019 he was sentenced to eight months in prison due to tax evasion, and again in 2020 to a further three years, again due to tax evasion. Sturm was further convicted of violating the anti-doping law.

He is considered the father of scientific management and the first management, or business, consultant. His ideas were revolutionary at the time but are now considered outdated by many industrial engineers. Taylor was born to a wealthy Philadelphia family and attended Phillips Exeter prep school in New Hampshire. Accepted to Harvard Law School, he never attended because of deteriorating vision. He later obtained a degree in mechanical engineering via correspondence courses, highly unusual for his era. He began his career in management consulting in the 1890s in Philadelphia. Business expert Peter Drucker wrote of him, “Frederick W. Taylor was the first man in recorded history who deemed work deserving of systematic observation and study.” In 1906, Taylor was accorded an honorary Doctor of Science degree from the University of Pennsylvania and later became a professor at the Tuck Business School at Dartmouth. He was also President of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) from 1906-07. The term “scientific management” was coined by US Supreme Court justice Louis Brandeis to describe Taylor’s principles, and in 1911, Taylor published his life’s work in the book The Principles of Scientific Management. His methods were often called “Taylorism” and are often disparaged today. Among his principles was the concept of doing time and motion studies – breaking down all work tasks into their component parts and measuring how long each took and how this be improved and made more efficient. An avid golfer, Taylor was a lifelong member of the Philadelphia Country Club, but it is not known how he came to participate in the 1900 Olympic golf event. He actually was a better tennis player and played that sport when he was younger. In 1881 he and Clarence Clark won the US tennis doubles championship at Newport, Rhode Island, the first time a US champion was crowned in doubles tennis.",

Airoldi was a son of peasants. He was not allowed to compete in 1896, officially because the Olympics did not admit professionals and Airoldi, in 1895, had accepted a cash prize for having won a race of 1,000 km from Torino to Barcelona, but that money had been given to him for a reason. He was winning the race but, a few kilometres from the finish, another athlete had cramps, so Airoldi carried him on his shoulders to the finish, and the judges decided to reward him to allow him to go home by train. That was enough for the Olympic Committee to disqualify him from the marathon, and despite appeals, Airoldi did not compete in 1896. Back in Italy, he lived for two years in the Lombardy Region and then moved to Switzerland in 1898. Later, after a short stay in Milano, he moved to Latin America to seek his fortune by performing various endurance feats. One time, at Porto Alegre, he was at risk of being lynched after losing a match against a horse. Airoldi returned to Italy in 1902 and remained in the world of sport as a race organizer and then as a manager of sports clubs, the last of which was the La Veloce cycling club in Legnano. Airoldi was married and had six children. He died from complications of diabetes in Milan in June 1929. In Italy, in the 2000s, two books were written about his Athenian adventure.",

He was a keen yachtsman, and died suddenly on board his yacht Malahne at Cowes in 1945. He had three sons, Kenneth, Bryan and Francis, who were all keen yachtsmen, with Kenneth and Francis both competing in the 1936 Olympics. They were part of the crew aboard Saskia (co-owned by Kenneth and Robert Steele in the 8-metre event at Kiel. After showing early promise, finishing fourth in races one and two, they never managed such a highly placed finish in the remaining races and finished sixth overall. Kenneth Preston was educated at Rugby School where he played for the rugby first XV. He was also a keen runner, once finishing second in the 440 yards in a national schools competition. After Rugby, Preston went to Trinity College Oxford and played for the rugby team, but missed out on a Blue due to an unfortunate ankle injury. Like his father and brothers, he enjoyed sailing, and for his 21st birthday was given the 15-metre Nayama, which he raced on the Solent. He competed in the 1936 and 1952 Olympics and throughout the 1950s was dominant amongst British “big boats”. He went to a third Olympics in 1960 as the “non-competing” captain of the Great Britain team. Preston was involved in sailing for most of his life and was a member of the Royal Yacht Squadron (RYS) for 72 years. He was their vice-commodore 1965-71 and during his tenure, HRH Prince Philip was the Squadron’s commodore. Shortly before his death, Preston presented the Sir Kenneth Preston Trophy to be contested by RYS members each year. Preston was also vice-commodore of the Royal Thames Yacht Club 1953-66. Although Kenneth Preston was well known as a yachtsman, he was also a highly successful businessman like his father. He left university without a degree and went into the family engineering business and became chairman of one of their acquisitions, Platt Brothers, who provided machinery for most of the Lancashire cotton industry in its heyday. He was knighted in 1959 for services to industry, at a time when his company was selling machinery overseas to third world countries. In addition to serving on the board of his own companies, Preston was also on the Midland Bank board of directors between 1945-76. Preston was also on the board of the southern area of British Rail and was an adviser to the British Export Credits Guarantee Corporation. Preston was a friend of the Duke of Beaufort and rode with the Beaufort Hunt in his younger days.

His breakout year was 1930, when he became the Canadian national schoolboy champion in the high jump and represented Canada in the event at the 1930 British Empire Games. Two years later, at the Canadian Olympic trials, he set a national high jump record with a height of 6 feet, 4 3/8 inches, and easily made the cut to represent his country at the 1932 Summer Olympics. He finished in a joint-ninth position in the high jump competition (compatriot Duncan McNaughton won the gold medal) and also competed in the triple jump event, where he did not rank. Portland also played ice hockey and, as would happen with Syl Apps four years later, was drafted into the National Hockey League shortly after his Olympic experience. A defenseman with the Senior Ontario Hockey Association’s Collingwood Combines, he signed on with the Montreal Canadiens in 1933 on a two-year contract. Although he was originally considered a top prospect, his rookie season did not impress the fans enough and he was traded to the NHL’s Boston Bruins for the remainder of the 1934-1935 season. Until 1936 he spent most of his time with the team’s affiliated Boston Cubs, but by the 1936-1937 season he became a regular and exclusive member of the Bruin’s lineup. His biggest success came in 1939, when the Bruins won the Stanley Cup playoffs and Portland had his name engraved on the cup as a member of the squad. In the middle of the following season he was traded to the league’s Chicago Blackhawks who, after only 21 games, returned him to the Montreal Canadiens in 1940. He stayed with the squad until 1943, at which point he joined the Canadian Army and served for the remainder of World War II, a stint that included his participation in the Invasion of Normandy. He returned to hockey in 1946 and spent the next three seasons in the American Hockey League with the Buffalo Bisons, Philadelphia Rockets, and Washington Lions before hanging up his skates for good in 1948.

920836,Giuseppe Cassioli,Male,26 October 1865,,, Italy,ITA,"Giuseppe Cassioli was an Italian painter and sculptor. Born in Firenze in 1865, he was the son of Lucrezia Chiari and the renowned Siena artist, Amos (1832-92), and originally lived in Asciano. Giuseppe developed his artistic talents in the 1880s. His father Amos was known for his paintings but Giuseppe focused on sculpture. He was trained by the sculptor Tito Sarrocchi. His religious works in particular were based on Renaissance art. In 1888, the right-side bronze door of the Duomo Santa Maria del Fiore in Firenze was commissioned to Giuseppe Cassioli, a work that took a long time due to the death of his father Amos and economic difficulties. The door was officially inaugurated in June 1899, with unanimous consent and appreciation. In that work, Cassioli placed his own self-portrait, as one of the heads of the right door knocker, in which he is represented, for all the difficulties encountered during production, as emblematically suffocated by a snake. The Duomo portal represents the apex of his sculptural production. Cassioli then expressed himself in the plans and realizations of the funeral monument to Gioacchino Rossini in the church of Santa Croce in Firenze (1902), in the monumental altar of the church of Christchurch in New Zealand (1916), and in the sculptural elements of the neo-Gothic facade of the Cathedral of Arezzo. In painting, he decorated the dome of the basilica of San Luca in Bologna, completed in 1932; the rooms of the Stock Exchange Palace of Odesa; and the internal decorations in the church of the Sette Santi Fondatori in Firenze, executed between 1927 and 1934. His studio was in Firenze, where he collaborated with his son Giuseppe Amos, born in 1901 from his marriage to Chiara Lardori. Cassioli later worked as a medallist, especially those designed and created in honor of the writers Edmondo De Amicis and Giosuè Carducci (Nobel Prize 1906), but above all by winning the competition that the IOC launched for the design of the Olympic Medals in 1923. He then created the medals, of which the obverse side was used from 1928-2000. Only the Olympic host and the number of the Olympiad were updated. The reverse side was used from 1928-68, until the 1972 München Olympics became the first Games with a different design for the reverse side of the medal. His medal, which originally had the title Trionfo, had a diameter of 55 mm and a weight of 65-74 grams, depending on the alloy. The embossing sticks are still preserved. Cassioli’s signature “GC” can be seen on the back. Although Cassioli only took part “hors concours”, he received a diploma similar to the awarded artists. Widowed for some time (his wife died very young at only 36 years) Cassioli continued working for 15 years, always accompanied by his son until his own death in October 1942. Buried in Firenze in the Monumental Cemetery, in the 1960s the family decided to transfer the artist’s remains to his hometown of Asciano, where he remains. Since the 1990s the town of Asciano has set up a small museum to remember the extraordinary life of this artist and his father Amos.",

During this time, he attended evening classes at the Rotterdam Academy of Fine Arts and Technical Sciences and earned a diploma in drawing. In 1926, he moved to Den Haag, where he taught drawing at various types of schools. In 1941, van Heel created murals for the Public Reading Room in Den Haag. After World War II, he lived and worked in Paris for two years. Subsequently, he was employed as a teacher at the Johan de Witt Lyceum in The Hague, where he remained until 1968. He kept his studio there even until 1983. From 1947-1954 he also taught at the Free Academy. Van Heel first painted in a moderate expressionist style and co-founded the groups De Werkers (1928) and De Groep (1936). After his stay in Paris in 1946, he gradually developed his own figurative language. In his landscapes, figures and still lifes, often painted in earth colors such as rusty brown, ocher and yellow, fluctuate between figuration and abstraction. His work is considered part of the New Hague School. In the early 1950s, van Heel and other Den Haag artists founded the group Verve and in 1960 the group Fugare. The painters active in these groups wanted to break with the conventions of the pre-war period but were less radical than some of the Amsterdam associations. Van Heel became known showing clowns and, after a visit to Spain, especially the rough Spanish soil. In 1956, he was involved in the design of a series of stamps for the Melbourne Olympics. Van Heel also served as a member of the selection committees for the Dutch contributions to the Venice and Paris Biennials. In 1959, he was appointed Knight and in 1968, Officer of the Order of Orange-Nassau. His 1952 entry Training on Saturday afternoon was an oil painting from 1951/52.

He also took part in the tournaments at the 1959 Mediterranean Games, capturing bronze, and the 1961 Pan Arab Games.
