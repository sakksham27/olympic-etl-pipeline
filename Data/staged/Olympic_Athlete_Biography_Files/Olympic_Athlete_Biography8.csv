He graduated from Massachusetts Normal Art School (now the Massachusetts College of Art and Design) in Boston, then became an instructor in industrial art at Cornell University from 1886-89. He later studied under Henri Chapu and Alexandre Falguière in Paris and was granted a scholarship to study in Roma for four years. After returning to the USA, MacNeil became a well-known sculptor of Indian subjects, commemorative works and medals, including the designing of the medal of award for the 1915 Pan American Exposition in San Francisco, and the quarter dollar for the United States government. He also taught art and was married to Carol Brooks MacNeil (1871-1944), a distinguished sculptor and student of Frederick MacMonnies. The Sun Vow is one of MacNeil’s best known works. It was created in 1899, but the cast was not made until 1919. The 183 x 83 x 137 cm work is located in the Metropolitan Museum in New York and shows an Indian initiation rite. A plaster model was exhibited in Amsterdam. The Indian Runner is known by various names: Snake Dance, The Returning of the Snakes and The Moqui - Prayer for Rain. Designed in 1896, the 57 cm high figure was cast in bronze the following year and is now located in the Art Institute Chicago. The run, in which the runner grabs snakes with his hands, is a Hopi ceremony asking for rain. In 1931, MacNeil took up the subject again in a medal. The bronze medal Hopi Prayer for Rain medal has a diameter of 7.3 cm. The Observer could not be clearly identified. In Ambush is the most likely of MacNeil’s sculptures. It may have been a later unused study for the sculpture group Coming of the White Man, created in 1904.",

However, it was his portraits and ability to capture his subject’s personality that earned him the recognition of his contemporaries. His portraits were often characterized by a detailed face set against hazy backgrounds. From 1879-82, Paulsen studied at the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts in København, but found the artists there too uninspired and sought connection to more radical circles. On several trips he visited Amsterdam and Paris. There he was inspired by Rembrandt and the French salon and was particularly influenced by Claude Monet. In the last decade of the 19th century, he was finally recognized by the Academy and received several awards, including the Thorvaldsen Medal. In 1908, he became a professor at the København Academy.

In 1887, he was apprenticed to Peseux as a house painter who advised him to take classes in Neuchâtel, after observing his zeal for drawing and study. Invited by an aunt after the death of his father, L’Éplattenier lived in Budapest and studied at the Decorative Art School where his talent was noticed. He then moved to Paris, where he studied painting, sculpture and architecture at the School of Decorative Arts and the National School of Fine Arts in the studio of Luc-Olivier Merson. L’Éplattenier was appointed professor at the University of Art and La Chaux-de-Fonds at age 23. Among his pupils was the later famous designer and architect Le Corbusier. At the same time he ran a studio. In 1914, L’Éplattenier resigned from the Art School after the dissolution of the new section which was a continuation of the upper classes. He then explored his creative side, and produced considerable work including painting, sculpture and decorative arts. He also became a member of numerous artist associations. Unlike his own regionally influenced works, L’Éplattenier opened up new paths as a teacher as defined by the Werkbund and as a forerunner of the Bauhaus. In 1946, he was killed in the rocky terrain on the Doubs River near Les Brenets while searching for new vistas to depict. Both sculptures submitted by L’Éplattenier are presented in the catalog of art competitions. The life-size stone statue of Swiss race walker Jean Linder (1878-1926) stands in front of the castle of Colombier near the shore of Lake Geneva. He was involved in the decoration of the castle in an early phase. The sculpture dates back to 1928 and was donated by the artist in 1939.",Listed in Olympians Who Died in Mountaineering Accidents (Died in the rocky terrain on the Doubs River while searching new motives.)

The venture proved to be very successful and Torrey sold the business to Charles Ulmer, Inc., although he was retained by the owners as vice president and designer. Because there were no Swallow class boats in the U.S. in 1948, the American entry for the Olympics was the runner-up boat in the Star class at the U.S. Trials.

In the 12-event All-Around competition he placed 71st individually despite having finished 10th in the nine event all-around. He finished last in the other three events of the triathlon – 100 yard dash, long jump and shot put, pulled down mostly by his 13-foot long jump and 15.4 time for the dash. But those marks don’t look so bad in another context, for George Eyser competed with a wooden leg. Nothing of the circumstances of the loss of his limb is known. Eyser arrived in America, from Germany, at the age of fourteen and settled in Denver, Colorado before moving to St. Louis where he worked as a book-keeper for a construction company. Eyser became a US citizen in 1894. He was a member of the Concordia team which won an international meet in Frankfurt, Germany in 1908, and also won the National Turnfest in Cincinnati in 1909.",Listed in Olympians With a Disability (Left leg amputee.)

Ender’s first Olympic medals came in 1972 when the 13-year-old finished second in the 200 metre individual medley, and helped the German Democratic Republic win silver medals in both relays. Ender won four gold medals in 1976 in the 100 metres and 200 metres freestyle, the 100 metres butterfly and the 400 metre medley relay, and added her eighth medal, a silver, in an upset loss to the Americans in the 4x100 freestyle relay. The most prolific female record breaker of modern times, Ender set 23 individual world records (1973-76) in currently recognized events, including 10 at 100 metre freestyle, four at 200 metre freestyle, six at the 100 metre butterfly, two in the 200 metre individual medley, and one in the 100 metre backstroke. Ender won 10 medals (eight gold, two silver) at the World Championships, which was also a record at the time. In both 1973 and 1975 she won four gold medals at the World Championships, and in 1974, she added four gold medals at the Wien (Vienna) European Championships. Kornelia Ender was named German Sportswoman of the Year from 1973-76, and was chosen European Sportswoman of the Year in 1973 and 1975. She married teammate Roland Matthes, a four-time Olympic backstroke champion, but they divorced, and she then married Olympic decathlete and bobsledder Steffen Grummt. Ender became a physiotherapist and moved to Mainz after re-unification, where she founded her own practice. In 1981 she was inducted into the International Swimming Hall of Fame. Her daughter Tiffany also became a high-performance swimmer, but never reached world class swimming. After the re-unification of Germany, former East German officials admitted to administering doping to nearly all their swimmers, including Ender.

61467,Ian Bruce,Male,7 June 1933,182.0,82, Canada,CAN,"Ian Bruce was a well-known Canadian designer, boat builder and championship sailor. A two-time Olympian, Bruce was born in Kingston, Jamaica, before moving to Nassau, Bahamas with his family after the Second World War. He attended boarding school at Trinity College in Port Hope, Ontario, Canada, and from there he moved to Montreal, Quebec, Canada to study engineering at McGill University. A fluke request from a friend to fill in for a sick sailing crew was Bruce’s first introduction to the sport on the assumption that he “could” actually sail because he was from the islands. He did not know how to sail, but fell in love after his first experience, which would become the focus of his life’s work. Bruce was best known for changing the face of the sailing world in 1970, when he invented, along with Bruce Kirby (with sails cut by Hans Fogh), the Laser sailing dinghy - one of the world’s most popular sailboats which was simple, low-cost but had high-performance qualities. An industrial engineer by trade who owned a small business manufacturing high-end sailboats, Bruce was soon recognized as the “Father of the Laser”, as it was produced for the mass market yet was still fast enough to race at the international level. The Laser entered the commercial market in 1971 and was introduced to the Olympic programme in 1996. Bruce had engineered a boat, rig, and manufacturing process that have essentially remained unchanged to this day. He even controlled the rules around the laser’s design - a shrewd business move that allowed his company to be the boat’s only manufacturer. At its peak, Bruce’s company (Montreal-based Performance Sailcraft) was producing 18,000 boats per year in nine plants around the world. Bruce spent his career in the boat building industry as he either designed or assisted in the design, developed and built all the following International or recognized classes: Finn, Fourteen, Contender, Laser, Optimist, Fireball, 470, Laser II, Tasar, Laser Radial, Byte and 29er. His own latest design, the Byte, is the male and female singlehander that was used in the 2010 Youth Olympic Games in Singapore. Along with representing Canada at two Olympic Games (finishing 7th in 1960, 12th in 1972), Bruce, a 63-year member of the Royal St. Lawrence Yacht Club in Montreal, twice won the prestigious Prince of Wales Trophy, which is essentially the world championships in International Fourteens. In 2009, Bruce was bestowed the “Order of Canada”, the country’s highest honour in recognition of his service to sailing, both in Canada and internationally, and in particular for his involvement in the design and development of high-performance boats for young sailors.",

25298,Vivian Woodward,Male,3 June 1879,,, Great Britain,GBR,"Universally acknowledged as one of the greatest British centre-forwards, Vivian Woodward was born, appropriately, in a house overlooking Kennington Oval, the venue of the FA Cup final. After being educated at Ascham College, Clacton, he joined his father in his architect’s practice but later became a farmer. He played for Clacton, Harwich & Parkestone and Chelmsford before joining Tottenham Hotspur in 1902 when the club was a member of the Southern League. He was with Tottenham when, in 1908, they were elected to Division 2 of the Football League and scored their first ever goal in League football. With 19 goals in 27 matches he was Tottenham’s top scorer for the season and played a significant part in their immediate promotion to Division 1. Woodward subsequently joined Chelsea who he helped regain First Division status in 1912. He stayed with Chelsea until the outbreak of the war, when he initially joined the Rifle Brigade but later became a captain the Footballer’s Battalion of the Middlesex Regiment. He was wounded in action early in 1916 and never played serious football again. Vivian Woodward was a skilful solo dribbler, an intelligent distributor of the ball and could play in any of the three inside-forward positions with equal facility. The England selectors readily recognized his talents, awarding him 15 of his 23 full international caps while he was playing for a non-league club. He scored a total of 29 goals, which remained an England record until 1958 when both Tom Finney and Nat Lofthouse brought their international tally up to 30. Woodward twice scored four goals in a full international and achieved the hat trick on two other occasions. He also played in 44 amateur internationals – including the 1908 and 1912 Olympics – scoring a total of 58 goals. His finest performances came in England’s first amateur international against France in Paris in 1906, when he scored eight goals, and against Holland in 1909 when he scored six times. Woodward won his first Olympic gold medal while serving as a director of Tottenham Hotspur which most surely constitutes a record for a director of a Football League club. When he was on the winning Olympic team for the second time in Stockholm four years later he had already passed his 33rd birthday and he remains, to this day, the oldest footballer ever to win an Olympic gold medal. Vivian Woodward maintained his interest in football long after he ceased playing and was director of Chelsea from 1922 to 1930.",

He took up serious cycling as a teenager, however, and joined the Finsbury Park Cycling Club and, before he was 14, had won his first 25-mile time trial. He later enjoyed participating in longer distance, and 12-hour, races and was part of the Great Britain team that won the Olympic road race team silver medal in 1928. It was a memorable year for Lauterwasser, as he broke the Road Records Association’s (RRA) 50-mile and 100-mile records by almost three and 18 minutes respectively. The country’s leading 12-hour racer, he won the Polytechnic Club’s Gayler Trophy in 1928, originally with a new British record of 237.8 miles. It was first thought that he had become the first man to cover the 12 hours in a speed of 20 mph. An appeal was lodged and dismissed but, in 1932, the course was re-measured, and it was agreed that Lauterwasser had covered 240 miles and 76 yards, thus recording that elusive first 20 mph 12-hour race. As a skilled mechanic, Lauterwasser opened a cycle shop in London in 1929 and produced bikes to individual specifications that incorporated the famous Lauterwasser handlebar. The financial implications of running his own business took its toll, and he ended up working for some of the best known British cycle manufacturers of the day, and in 1965, joined Alex Moulton and helped with the design of the famous ”Moulton” small-wheeled cycles. He carried on working for Moulton until he was 90, when a fall at home resulted in a broken leg, which ended his working career. Lauterwasser was the president of the Pedal Club in 1974, and his son Alan was also a successful cyclist.",

At times it was also known as Proudfoot, Bird and Rawson; Proudfoot, Rawson & Souers; Proudfoot, Rawson, Souers & Thomas; or Monheim, Bird & Proudfoot. A large number of their buildings are listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places, mostly in Des Moines, Iowa. In 1928, the company participated with the design Field House, University of Iowa in the Art Competitions in both categories Architecture, Designs for Town Planning, and Architecture, Architectural Designs. The Field House was officially inaugurated in 1927. It was funded by bonds and built for only $300,000. The building had a sports hall with a capacity of over 13,000 seats and at that time probably the world’s largest indoor swimming pool at 50 yards. A few years ago, the pool was replaced by a fitness center. William Thomas Proudfoot’s father was a carpenter. In 1880, he started working for the architectural firm of Foster & Liebbe in Des Moines. His only professional training were courses at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), which he attended for less than a year from 1884/85. He then worked in South Dakota, Kansas and Salt Lake City (Utah) before returning to Des Moines in 1896. He was considered one of the outstanding architects in the state of Iowa. Harry Dustan Rawson received a B.A. degree in architecture from MIT in 1896. Subsequently, he went on a bicycle tour through Europe. After a short spell in Chicago, he returned to his hometown of Des Moines forming Hallett & Rawson, and in 1910, he joined Proudfoot & Bird. The company probably also benefitted from his brother Charles Augustus’ (1867-1936) connections as a senator and member of the Republican National Committee. He served as president of the Iowa Chapter of the AIA. Henry Clark Souers attended architectural classes at Iowa State College and Columbia University. In New York he worked for Des Moines born architect Frank M. Andrews. In 1914, Souers returned to Iowa to join Proudfoot, Bird & Rawson, as a designer.

Internationally Koch first burst on the scene by finishing third at the 1974 European Junior Championships, the first medal for an American in top-level cross-country competition. At the 1976 Olympics, Koch put on an amazing display. Besides his silver medal, he had the fastest leg in the relay pulling the Americans from eighth to third; was sixth in the 15 km. race; and actually led the 50 km. at the halfway point, before fading to 13th. It was an unparalleled performance for an American at that level of competition. Koch had some tough years after the Olympics. He was not prepared for the celebrity thrust upon him and skiied poorly for several years. He also began to have problems with exercise-induced asthma, but refused to blame that for the trouble. At the 1980 Olympics, Koch was America’s best skiier, but his performances lacked the luster of four years earlier. After 1980, however, Bill Koch changed his training methods, began skiing longer marathon races, and developed a technique similar to skating with his skis. It enabled him to become the world’s top cross-country skier. In 1982 he won the individual Nordic World Cup, emblematic of the top skiier for the season. He led the same competition for much of 1983 but fell off at the end to finish third, still by far the top American ever. In 1982 he finished third in the 30 km. World Championship, the first American to win a medal at that competition.",Father of Will Koch Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the World Nordic Ski Championships (0–1–1 1976 Innsbruck (Olympics) CCS silver: 30 km; 1982 Oslo CCS bronze: 30 km)

At a doping test during a training camp in South Africa in 1992, a high dose of clenbuterol was found in her urine and that of their teammates Katrin Krabbe and Silke Möller. All three athletes were suspended for one year by the German Athletics Federation, but the International Athletics Association extended this to two years. Krabbe sued the IAAF and received damages (1.2 million DM), while Breuer did not and was able to compete again after the ban. Breuer had a long list of successful competitions and set four world records. Her coach was the highly controversial Thomas Springstein, who also became her life partner. She won seven World Championships medals as follows: Gold – 1997 4×400; Silver – 1991 400; 2001 4×400; Bronze – 1991 4×100 and 4×400, 1997 4×400, 1999 4×400. This record was completed by two golds and three bronzes at the World Indoor Championships. At European Championships she won four golds in 1990, 1998 and 2002, and also won two gold medals at the European Indoor Championships. All-in-all she earned 22 national titles in the former GDR and re-unified Germany. In 1998 Breuer was runner-up for German Sportswoman of the Year, but was elected Runner of the Year by “Runner’s World”, and in 2001 was German Track & Field Athlete of the Year.

However, Stokes was not chosen to run in that event, and racism has always been considered a factor as Stokes and Tidye Pickett were the first Black women to make the US Olympic team, although neither competed in 1932. In 1936 Stokes again attended the Olympic Trials and made the final of the 100 metres. She made the relay pool, although her final finish is not recorded, but again she did not compete at the Berlin Olympics in any event. Stokes hoped to try again for the 1940 Olympics but that was not to be because of World War II. In 1941 she founded the Colored Women’s Bowling League and won many titles over the next 30 years. Stokes married Caribbean cricketer Wilfred Fraser in 1944 and had a son and raised a stepdaughter.

Chavez was born in Paris to Peruvian parents, graduating from the Violet School with an engineering degree in 1908. He attended an aviation school started by Henry and Maurice Farman, and received his pilot’s license in 1910. In August 1910 Chavez established an altitude record of 1,647 metres while flying to Blackpool, England. The next month he improved that to 2,700 metres over the city of Issy, France. On 23 September 1910 Chavez took off from Ried-Brig in Switzerland attempting the first aerial crossing of the Alps. He made the crossing but his plane, the Blériot XI, had been damaged by heavy winds during the flight, and he crashed on landing and was killed. He was posthumously given Olympic Diploma of Merit #10 for his feats. Chavez became a hero in Peru. He was buried in France, but his remains were exhumed and expatriated to Peru in 1957.

His most famous, however, would be his last, as he joined the Toronto Granites in 1920 and played with them through 1924, capturing two Allan Cups and an Olympic gold medal along the way. After two consecutive Allan Cup victories, awarded to the team as Canadian men’s amateur senior-level hockey champions, the Granites were sent to the 1924 Winter Olympics, where McCaffrey played in five games and scored twenty goals. McCaffrey’s career had far from peaked, and the following season he joined the Toronto St. Pats of the National Hockey League and stayed with them during their transformation into the Toronto Maple Leafs and early into the 1927-1928 season, when he was traded to the Pittsburgh Pirates. During the 1929-1930 season, he was traded once more, this time to the Montreal Canadiens. It was a beneficial move for McCaffrey, as the Canadiens won the Stanley Cup in 1930. The following season, he played 22 out of 44 games with the Canadiens, but was then sent to the Providence Reds of the Canadian-American hockey league. Although he was technically eligible to have his name engraved on the Stanley Cup when the Canadiens won it again in 1931, his name was left off as he did not play in the playoff games.

In 1902 he opened an art school in Chelsea. He was financially one of the most successful, and eventually one of the most honored, portrait painters working in Britain in the 20th century, although he was partially color blind. Orpen painted more than 600 portraits mainly of well-known British High Society personalities. His portrait style was indebted to Édouard Manet (1832-1883) and Diego Velázquez (1599-1660). During World War I, Orpen was the most prolific of the official artists sent by Britain to the Western Front. After the peace conference in Versailles in 1919, he painted the famous The Signing of Peace in the Hall of Mirrors, Versailles, 28 June 1919. As a result of his war experiences, he later suffered from alcoholism. His brother Richard Francis Caulfield Orpen was a well known architect and watercolor artist, and was a governor and guardian of the National Gallery of Ireland. As a member of the jury in 1928, Sir William Orpen was not allowed to be awarded a prize, so he exhibited “out of competition”. The Dead Ptarmigan was a well-known self-portrait painted in 1909. The painting (oil on canvas, 100 x 91 cm), formerly owned by Colonel Sir Hutcheson Poe, is now in the National Gallery of Ireland. There is an interesting story behind Sergeant Murphy and Things. Sergeant Murphy was a highly successful horse in steeplechase races. The painting (oil on canvas, 75 x 102 cm) from 1923 or 1924 also shows its jockey, Captain Tuppy Bennett, trainer George Blackwell and his American owner Stephen “Laddie” Sanford. The title refers to a painting by the famous Sir Alfred Munnings titled Sergeant Murphy and Trainer. Orpen showed Munnings in his painting on the right as a spectator of the scene. In 1924, Lord Dewar bought the painting from the artist for £500. In 2020 it was auctioned for € 175,000.",Listed in Olympian Members of the Nobility (Sir)

920886,Francesco Messina,Male,15 December 1900,,, Italy,ITA,"As a young artist, Italian sculptor Francesco Messina was an excellent draftsman, and found an early affinity for the human form. He soon began to sculpt in clay (terra cotta) and other media. He studied in Genoa before moving to Milano in 1932, and was soon appointed a tenured professor at the Brera Art Academy, developing into one of the most important figurative sculptors of the 20th century. In the 1930s, his sculptures were exhibited throughout Europe in group shows of Italian artists. One of his best known works is the Dying Horse at the entrance to the Italian public broadcaster RAI in Roma. Initially influenced by futurism, he remained attached to figurative representation, mostly in the form of nudes and portrait busts, in bronze, marble, plaster and (painted) terracotta. His daughter Paola also became a sculptor and later his biographer. Messina’s association with the Fascist Party (he was a long-time member) during World War II may have been a simple question of opportunism, since it facilitated his receiving public appointments and public commissions. His association was sufficient to bring about a brief post-war suspension as director of the Brera Academy. His art was rarely political, but after World War II occasionally dealt with themes like war and violence. Messina was little known outside Italy, though his commissioned works can still be seen in a number of countries, and he sometimes exhibited internationally. Messina created a series of sculptures that show boxers. The marble statue depicted in the Berlin 1936 catalog is one of the larger-than-life sports statues that was erected around the Stadio dei Marmi in Roma. Il Pugilatore was created in 1931-1933 and was donated by the Province of Ascoli Piceno. The boxer Marino Girolami is said to have been the model. The bronze figure Il Marciatore dates from 1931 and was exhibited at the Venezia Biennale the following year.",

Four years later, as a middleweight, he won gold, the same year that he also won the Asian Championships and came in fourth at the Worlds. Slimming down to lightweight, he took bronze at the 1959 World Championships. This made him a contender at the 1960 Rome Olympics, where he repeated his success by coming in third. Aziz’s last major international tournament came the following year at the World Championships, where he finished fourth. During the country’s 1963 Ramadan Revolution he was tortured by the new regime as a leftist, and he retired the next year, following the execution of his coach.

In 1947 and 1948 Davies won both 220 yds breaststroke and medley relay titles at the Australian championships and earned a spot on the 1948 Australian Olympic team. At the Olympics, Davies competed in the 200 metre breaststroke, finishing fourth. Although the timekeepers recorded him at 0.2s faster than the bronze medalist Bob Sohl, the judges believed that Sohl had touched first and awarded him the bronze. After the London Olympics, Davies enrolled at the University of Michigan, where he studied political science and law. He continued to swim, winning silver in the 200 yds breaststroke at the 1948 NCAA Championships and at the AAU Meet, won gold in the 1951 200 breaststroke, and indoors in the 1952 200 short course breaststroke. These results earned him a spot on the 1952 Australian Olympic team without competing at the Australian Championships. Considered as a favorite for 200 breaststroke gold after setting a new 200 yd world record earlier this year, Davies did not disappoint, winning gold with a strong finish after trailing by two seconds at midway. Davies retired from swimming after the 1952 Olympics and returned to the United States to continue his studies at the University of Michigan. He later transferred to UCLA, where he completed his degree in 1959. After graduation, Davies settled in Pasadena, California and became a naturalized US citizen, passing the bar examinations to become an attorney. From 1960-71 Davies was associated with, and then became a partner of Hagenbaugh, Murphy & Davies where he specialized in litigation and tried many cases in the areas of personal injury, products liability, medical malpractice, construction, and insurance coverage. Davies joined Rosenfeld, Meyer & Susman in 1971, becoming a partner in 1972, practicing litigation, and representing major motion picture studios and entertainment companies. In 1986, Davies was nominated to a seat on the United States District Court for the Central District of California. He presided over the trial of a group of Los Angeles Police Department officers charged in relation to the Rodney King incident in 1992. In 1993 he was named District Judge of The Year by the Criminal Justice Section of the Los Angeles County Bar Association and received the Congressional Certificate of Special Recognition for Exemplary Performance. He also received the Daniel O’Connell Award from the Irish-American Bar Association. Davies retired from the bench in 1998 and later continued to practice law privately, mostly as a private arbitrator. Davies was inducted into the International Swimming Hall of Fame (ISHOF) in 1984 and the Sport Australia Hall of Fame in 1992. Personal Bests: 200 m breaststroke – 2:29.3 (1951).",

Perhaps her greatest achievement, however, came at the 1996 Summer Olympics, when she won a silver medal in the 200m IM following a controversial victory from the Irish competitor Michelle Smith, who later received a four-year ban for tampering with a drug test urine sample. She also finished 5th in the 4×200m freestyle relay (alongside Shakespeare, Malar, Andrea Schwartz, Jessica Deglau, and Sophie Simard) and 7th in the 4×100m freestyle relay (with Shakespeare, Julie Howard, and Andrea Moody). Limpert was the Canadian flag-bearer at the 1998 Commonwealth Games, where she won gold in the 200m IM. She then had great success at the 1999 Pan American Games, winning gold in the 4×100m (alongside Deglau, Evanetz, and Laura Nicholls) and the 4×200m (with Deglau, Malar, and Nicholls) freestyle relays and bronze in the 100m freestyle and 200m IM. She next competed at the 2000 Summer Olympics, where she missed a podium spot in the 200m IM by 0.12 seconds and participated in all three relays. Later that year, at the World Championships (short course), she captured silver in the 100m IM and bronze in the 200m IM, her last major international medals. After graduating from the University of British Columbia in 2002, she retired from active competition in 2005 and was inducted into the Canadian Olympic Hall of Fame in 2007 and the New Brunswick Sports Hall of Fame in 2008.","Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the Summer Pan American Games (2–5–3 1995 Mar del Plata SWI silver: 200 m freestyle, 200 m medley, 4×100 m freestyle relay, 4×200 m freestyle relay, and 4×100 m medley relay, bronze: 100 m freestyle; 1999 Winnipeg SWI gold: 4×100 m freestyle relay and 4×200 m freestyle relay, bronze: 100 m freestyle and 200 m medley) Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the Summer Universiade (2–1–0 1993 Buffalo SWI gold: 200 m medley and 4×200 m freestyle relay, silver: 4×100 m freestyle relay) Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the Pan Pacific Swimming Championships (0–2–4 1993 Kobe bronze: 4×100 m freestyle relay; 1995 Atlanta bronze: 4×200 m freestyle relay; 1997 Fukuoka silver: 200 m medley and 4×100 m freestyle relay; 1999 Sydney bronze: 4×100 m freestyle relay and 4×200 m freestyle relay) Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the World Aquatics Championships (0–0–0 1991 Perth silver: 4×50 m freestyle relay (demonstration event)) Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the World Short-Course Swimming Championships (25 m) (1–1–1 1995 Rio de Janeiro gold: 4×200 m freestyle relay; 2000 Athina silver: 100 m medley, bronze: 200 m medley) Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the British Empire/Commonwealth Games (1–2–7 1994 Victoria SWI silver: 200 m medley, bronze: 100 m freestyle, 4×100 m freestyle, 4×200 m freestyle, and 4×100 m medley; 1998 Kuala Lumpur SWI gold: 200 m medley, silver: 4×100 m medley, bronze: 4×100 m freestyle; 2002 Manchester SWI bronze: 200 m medley and 4×100 m freestyle)"

He used the fortune he amassed from this to branch into gold mining, cattle ranching, and real estate, compiling a fortune estimated in the early 1960s as $40 million (US). In January 1964 Bartholomae was at his Newport Beach estate where he lived with his brother, Charles, Charles’s wife, Carmen Gallardo, and her sister, Minola, who had come to visit. Carmen was recovering from the birth of her recent child, and while cooking breakfast, collapsed on the floor. Bartholomae went to look after her, and had picked up the knife with which she was chopping mushrooms. Her sister came into the room and flew into a rage, thinking Bartholomae had hurt her, and as she did not speak English, could not understand his protestations. She grabbed the knife from his hands and stabbed him twice in the abdomen, killing him. Gallardo would later stand trial but was found not guilty of manslaughter.",Stepfather of Carl Paul Listed in Olympians Who Were Murdered (Murdered.)
77284,Irina Press,Female,10 March 1939,168.0,75, Soviet Union,URS,"Together with her sister Tamara, Irina Press formed a duo known as the “Press Sisters”, who were successful in various women’s track & field events in the early 1960s. Though slightly less successful than her sister, Irina still won two Olympic gold medals. Her first gold medal came in 1960 at the Rome Olympics in the 80 hurdles, a discipline where she had set a world record of 10.6 two months earlier. Press later set four more 80 hurdles world records – 10.5 twice in 1964 and 10.4 and 10.3 in 1965. In 1960 she also competed in the 4×100 relay, finishing fourth with the Soviet team. Her second Olympic gold medal came at the 1964 Tokyo Games in the pentathlon. Press had set several world records in the pentathlon prior to the Tokyo Games (4,880 in 1959; 4,902, 4,959, 4,972 in 1960; and 5,137 in 1961), where the event made its début, and she won in yet another world record of 5,246. In 1964 she also competed in the 80 metre hurdles, finishing fourth, and in the shot put, finishing sixth behind her older sister. Irina Press also competed at the 1962 European Championships, but did not finish the pentathlon due to injury and at the 1961 Universiade, where she won gold in the 80 hurdles. Irina won 13 Soviet titles – 80 hurdles in 1960-61 and 1964-66; 4×100 relay 1961 and 1964; and pentathlon in 1959-61 and 1964-66. The Press sisters retired in 1966, coinciding with the introduction of required gender verification in track & field. This led to widespread, yet never proven, rumors regarding the Presses’ genders. After earning a physical education degree, Irina Press worked with the Dynamo club to guide other top athletes in their careers. Until 2000 she also worked as a department head of the Soviet and later the Russian State Committee of Physical Culture, Sports and Tourism and from 2000, until her death in 2004, she worked as the head of the Committee of Physical Culture and Sports of the Government of Moskva City.

In addition to his triple jump crown, Connolly won medals in the high jump and long jump. One can safely assume that this victory adequately compensated Connolly for the decision he had made at Boston some two months earlier. Connolly’s dean at Harvard had counselled him not to make the trip to Athens because his low academic standing might prejudice his being readmitted to the university upon his return. Connolly, however, entertained no doubts as to his priorities and walked out of Harvard, not setting foot there until 50 years later when, as a well-known writer of Gloucester fishing stories, he was invited to speak on literature before the Harvard Union. In 1898, Connolly was with the 9th Massachusetts Infantry at the Siege of Santiago, but in 1900 he again sought Olympic honors.He improved on his 1896 winning mark, but had to settle for second place behind Meyer Prinstein. Connolly missed the 1904 Olympics but competed in 1906, failing to make a valid jump in either the long or triple jump. Connolly later served in the Navy and in 1912 he ran for Congress as a Progressive, although he was defeated. Connolly covered Pershing’s “punitive expedition” into Mexico for Colliers and in 1917 he became European naval correspondent for the magazine. He remained a writer for the rest of his life.

78692,Carl Lewis,Male,1 July 1961,188.0,80, United States,USA,"Carl Lewis is considered by many to be the greatest track & field athlete of all time and, with nine Olympic gold medals, 10 Olympic medals, and eight gold medals at the World Championships, it is a justifiable claim. His Olympic gold medals came in 1984 (100 metres, 200 metres, 4×100 metres relay, long jump), 1988 (100 metres, long jump), 1992 (4×100 metres relay, long jump), and 1996 (long jump). His four victories in 1984 matched the record set by Jesse Owens at the 1936 Olympic Games. In 1996 at Atlanta, Lewis ended his Olympic career by equalling Al Oerter’s record of winning the same Olympic event four times consecutively, with Lewis’s feat occurring in the long jump. At the World Athletics Championships, Lewis won the 100 metres, long jump and ran on the winning 4×100 relay team in 1983 and 1987. In 1991, he repeated in the 100 and the relay, but finished second to Mike Powell in the greatest long jump duel in history. In that event, Lewis set his lifetime personal best of 8.87 (29-1¼), but lost out to Powell, who with a mark of 8.95 (29-4), broke the legendary world record set by Bob Beamon at the 1968 Olympics. Lewis also competed at the 1993 World Championships, finishing third in the 200. At the Pan American Games he won bronze (1979) and gold (1987) in long jump and was also a member of the gold medal winning 4×100 relay team (with Lee McNeill, Harvey Glance, and the non-Olympian Lee McRae) in 1987. Lewis twice set individual world records at 100 metres (1988, 1991), although his 1988 world record came at the Seoul Olympics when he initially finished second behind Ben Johnson’s presumed world record, although Johnson was disqualified for doping the next day. In relays he was a member of teams that posted world records at 4×100 metres six times and 4×200 metres three times. Although almost universally considered the greatest long jumper ever, he never set a world record in that event. In addition to his 1991 World Championships personal best, Lewis was denied that record in 1982, when he won the USOC National Sports Festival. Lewis had a jump estimated by most knowledgeable observers to be beyond 30 feet (9.14), but it was controversially ruled a foul, although no mark was found on the plasticine beyond the take-off mark. Despite his performances, Lewis never achieved great popularity among fans in the United States, and even world-wide his ability outstripped his appeal. He made some attempts to start a pop singing career, but with almost disastrous results, although he has appeared in a few movies. He did become wealthy from his athletics career and many athletes credit Lewis with increasing performance fees in the sport.

8643,Cassius Clay,Male,17 January 1942,187.0,80, United States,USA,"He was born Cassius Marcellus Clay, the son of Odesa and Marcellus Clay but he would not keep the name. He preferred instead a name which dignified the black man, and he wore it well as the most famous athlete of his time. His story began as a reed-thin middleweight when he won the 1959 Golden Gloves championship. He repeated that victory in 1960, adding to it the AAU title and the Olympic light-heavyweight crown. Thus was born the saga of “The Greatest.” Clay turned pro right after the Rome Olympics and fought his first fight against Tunney Hunsaker. He won easily and continued to win as he worked his way up the heavyweight ranks. He punctuated his pugilistic abilities by composing doggerel verse to predict the outcome of his fights – “Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee, his hands can’t hit, what his eyes can’t see.” Clay was the fastest heavyweight anybody had ever seen but few gave him a chance against “the Big Bear,” Sonny Liston, when they met for the heavyweight title on 25 February 1964. But Clay disarmed the menacing Liston, winning by a TKO in seven, and afterwards told the world he had embraced the Black Muslim faith and taken the name Muhammad Ali. The Muhammad Ali of the late 60s was an awesome fighting machine. With great speed, deceptive power, and an unequaled ability to take a punch, he was never beaten, never even seriously challenged. But the courts took away the title that other boxers could not. He refused induction into the U.S. Army claiming a conscientious objection because of his faith, so he was stripped of his titles and a conviction was sought. The attempted conviction was overturned. Ali was vindicated and allowed to fight again but he had lost three years of his prime. He made a comeback, losing to then undefeated champion and 1964 Olympic heavyweight gold medalist, Joe Frazier, in a 15-round decision. However, Ali would later win back the heavyweight title by defeating George Foreman, another Olympic champion. He would eventually lose the title again, and then regain it against 1976 Olympian Leon Spinks. But he was never the same fighter after his three-year exile. He fought twice more against Frazier, winning both fights in epic struggles, including the Thrilla in Manila, often considered the greatest heavyweight bout of all-time. In the late 70s, Ali attempted to regain the title again, but he was overweight and out of shape. A mere caricature of the once great fighter, he was punished by heavyweight champion Larry Holmes. Ali finally was convinced to retire but not before he had made his mark on the world of sport – as The Greatest. Ali’s career professional record was 56 wins, 37 by knockout, and 5 losses. Later in life, he developed post-traumatic Parkinsonism, causing him to walk and speak very slowly. In 1996 at Atlanta, he was honored, and honored us all, by lighting the Olympic Flame at the Opening Ceremony. He was simply The Greatest.","Torchbearer within the Olympic Stadium at the Opening Ceremony of the 1996 Summer Olympics (Lit flame) Bearer of the Olympic Flag at the opening ceremony of the 2012 Summer Olympics Listed in Olympic Boxers Who Won a Professional World Championship (Olympics - 1960 Light-heavyweight (Gold); Professional World Champion - Undisputed Heavyweight (1964-1964); WBC Heavyweight (1964-1967); Undisputed Heavyweight (1967-1967); Undisputed Heavyweight (1974-1978); WBA Heavyweight (1978-1979).)

33376,Neil Adams,Male,27 September 1958,178.0,78, Great Britain,GBR,"Regarded as Britain’s finest ever male judoka, it is ironic that Neal Adams should be as much remembered by two bouts he lost as for his many international tournaments victories. Adams learnt his judo in a small wooden hut in the middle of a car park that doubled as the local judo club and progressed quickly to become junior European champion in 1977. But 1977 was also the year Adams made his breakthrough in the senior ranks by winning a bronze medal at the European Championships. He repeated the feat in 1978 and also added a victory in the prestigious Kano Cup tournament as well. Throughout 1979 and 1980 he maintained a fierce rivalry with Italy’s Ezio Gamba and the two men swapped victories in the sport’s main championships. Adams defeated Gamba to win the 1979 European Championships whilst Gamba took revenge at the World Championships. The deciding meeting of the two came in the Olympic final in Moscow with Gamba edging to a narrow victory. Adams rebounded from this defeat by producing a scintillating performance at the 1981 World Championships to become the first man from outside Japan to win the middleweight title. Between the Moscow and Los Angeles Olympic Games Adams won every championship he contested with the exception of the 1983 World Championships, where he lost a controversial decision in the final, and he arrived in California as a clear gold medal favourite. He produced a series of fine victories to progress to the final where, after all the closest rivals had been eliminated, he would face the little-known German Frank Wieneke. Adams appeared to be in control of the fight but a lapse of concentration was expertly punished by Wieneke and Adams was thrown for an ippon, the first such defeat of his entire career, and the German was crowned Olympic Champion. Although he won a fifth European title in 1985, he was never quite the same fighter after his Olympic disappointment and retired after a final Olympic appearance in 1988. Adams became a leading coach after his retirement from competitive and has been head coach to the Great Britain and Belgian national teams. In addition he has produced films and technical manuals about the sport. His elder brother, Chris Adams, narrowly missed selection for the 1976 Olympics but later left the sport for a career as a professional wrestler in America. Chris Adams was killed in a shooting incident in a Miami barroom in 2001.",Husband of Niki Jenkins Listed in Members of the International Judo Federation Hall of Fame (Inducted in 2013)

17912,Charles Beachcroft,Male,1870,,, Great Britain,GBR,"Charles Beachcroft was the opening bat for both the Exeter and Dawlish cricket clubs in 1900 and he also played for a local team called Starcross. As the captain he opened the batting with Arthur Birkett against the France at the Paris Olympics and scored 23 runs in the first innings. In the second innings he scored 54 before being run out and therefore made a considerable contribution to the British win. Beachcroft was born Charles Beachey Kay and was the son of a Manchester vicar who died when Charles was just seven. In 1896 Kay, who was married with four children, ran away from Devon to London with a 17-year-old girl, and whilst in London they lived as ‘Mr & Mrs Beachcroft’. Kay was charged with abduction but was found not guilty after he told the court he would marry the girl after he obtained his divorce. He kept to his word and later that year he married again but using the name Charles Beachey Kay Beachcroft. After the Paris Olympic success Charles became one of the best all-round sportsmen in Devon and was a county player at cricket, hockey and rugby. He also had the distinction of introducing ping pong (table tennis) to the county. On top of that, he was an excellent shot and took part in many shooting competitions. He was also a good swimmer and served on the committee of the Exeter Swimming Club. At the time of the Paris tournament, Beachcroft was the landlord of the Royal Hotel, Dawlish, but the business failed in 1901 when he was declared bankrupt. In 1905 he embarked on a complete change of career when he turned to the stage in the days when musical halls were at their peak and he appeared on the famous stages of the Stoll-Moss company (which was bought by Andrew Lloyd Webber in 2000). Beachcroft was, amongst other things, a song writer, comedian and humourist, and pantomime villain. He worked and toured with many women over the years and he had a reputation for being a serial adulterer and he had many wives and is believed to have fathered 13 children. He emigrated to Australia in 1921 and as Jack Trent, he entertained audiences there and also in New Zealand until his death in 1928. He continued playing cricket in Australia and in 1924, at the age of 54, he scored 57 runs for Sir Benjamin Fuller’s XI against the Vagabonds of Christchurch, New Zealand.",

68653,Donna Fraser,Female,7 November 1972,180.0,64, Great Britain,GBR,"Donna Fraser was a 100/200 runner during her schooldays and part of the British sprint relay team that won a silver medal at the World Junior Championships in 1990. Persuaded to switch to the 400 for 1991, she showed potential by becoming European Junior champion at the event. However her progress slowed in the early nineties and it was not until 1996 that she began to match the promise of her teenage years. She qualified for the Atlanta Olympics and was a regular at major championships from then onwards. Fraser won her first major senior medals in 1998 with Commonwealth bronzes at the 400 metres and the sprint relay and a European Championship bronze with the 4 x 400 relay. By now she was a training partner of Cathy Freeman and when Freeman won the Olympic gold in that famous race in Sydney, Fraser finished in fourth place whilst breaking the 50 second barrier for the only time in her career. She missed most of the intervening years with injury but returned for her third Olympic Games in Athens where she was a part of the 4 x 400 relay team that crossed the line in fourth place. When fit she was a valuable member of the relay team and won two more bronze medals at the Worlds in 2005 and 2007. Fraser qualified for her fourth Olympic team in 2008 but this time was an unused member of the relay squad in Beijing. She retired from international athletics in 2009 although she continued to compete at club level. In February 2010 the IAAF announced that American Crystal Cox had her results annulled, due to an admission of doping, for the period prior to the 2004 Olympics. Cox ran in the heats of the 4 x 400 relay in Athens and IAAF rules introduced in March 2004 state that in these circumstances Cox’s team has to be disqualified. The second anniversary of this announcement passed in early 2012 with no decision having been made as to the reallocation of medals. But in 2013, both the IAAF and the IOC announced that the result would stand due to it being impossible to prove Cox had doped after the rule change and the American squad (except Cox) would be allowed to retain their gold medals and that they now considered the case closed.

Gorišek began ski jumping when he was eight, eventually going on to compete for the Yugoslav national team. In 1953 and 1957 he was the student world champion. In between his two student titles he competed at the 1956 Cortina d’Ampezzo Olympics, finishing in a disappointing 50th place. Gorišek then gave up on his sporting career and graduated from the University of Ljubljana with a degree in civil engineering in 1961. Along with his brother Vlado they began to design and build ski jumps. In the late 1960s the two brothers constructed the famous Letalnica bratov Gorišek (“Flying hill of Gorišek brothers”) ski flying hill in in Planica, Slovenia, which saw multiple world records set in the discipline. In the early 1980s the brothers began work on the Malo Polje ski jump on the mountain of Igman, a few miles south of Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina. The ski jump was completed and opened in 1983 ready for use at the 1984 Sarajevo Olympics. After the Olympics the venue became a local tourist hotspot with an increase in recreational skiing. The area became a key strategic point during the Siege of Sarajevo in the early 1990s, however, with the venue now mostly destroyed. In 2010 Gorišek and his son Sebastjan renovated and enlarged the Vikersundbakken ski flying hill in Vikersund, Norway. The site has hosted multiple World Ski Flying Championships, with several world records being set there.",

They would become one of the most innovative ice dance couples ever in international figure skating. Starting in pairs skating, they placed second at the 1982 Canadian Junior Nationals, but after Isabelle suffered a serious accident and hit her head on the ice, they switched to ice dancing. After a third-place finish at the Canadian Nationals in 1985, and angry at the policies of the Canadian Figure Skating Association, they began to compete for France from 1986. The Duchesnays were four-time French champs, winning the title in 1986-87 and 1990-91, but their biggest victory came in winning the 1991 World Championships, which followed a silver in that event in 1990 and a bronze in 1989. The Duchesnays also won Skate America in the 1986-87 season. They were three-time medalists at the European Championships, winning bronze in 1988 and 1990 and a silver in 1991. The Duchesnays choreographer was Christopher Dean, the 1984 Olympic ice dancing gold medalist, and he and Isabelle would marry, but also later divorce. Their best known free dance performance was set to jungle drums and was initially quite controversial to the staid international skating judges.

77179,Aleksandra Chudina,Female,6 November 1923,188.0,73, Soviet Union,URS,"An all-around athlete, Aleksandra Chudina excelled in track & field athletics and volleyball. Chudina was the most dominant female Soviet athlete during the 1940s and 50s and is considered as the most dominant female Soviet athlete ever. Chudina started her sports career in 1937 at age 14 with the women’s bandy team Krasnaya Roza Moskva and from 1943-47 played bandy with Dynamo Moskva, winning Soviet Cups with them in 1945 and 1947 and Moskva championships in 1945-46. As a track & field athlete, Chudina excelled at every track & field event women competed at that era. At the 1952 Olympics, Chudina won silvers in the long jump and javelin throw and bronze in the high jump. At the European Championships, Chudina won the pentathlon title in 1954, high jump silver in 1946 and long jump silver in 1954. Chudina also set four world records during her career – high jump (1.73) in 1954; pentathlon in 1953 (4,704) and 1955 (4,750); and 4x200 relay in 1950 (1:40.6). At the Soviet Championships, Chudina won a record 39 Soviet titles between 1945-56 – 400 in 1945; 80 hurdles in 1949-51; 4x100 relay in 1948-51 and 1953; 4x200 relay in 1948, 1950 and 1953; high jump in 1946-47, 1949-51, and 1953-54; long jump in 1947-51, and 1953-54; javelin throw in 1948, 1953, and 1955-56; and pentathlon in 1946-51 and 1953-55. However, Chudina’s best sport was probably volleyball. From 1945-63 she played volleyball with Dynamo Moskva and from 1949-60 was with the Soviet national team, serving as team captain in the 1950s, when the Soviet team dominated women’s volleyball. Chudina was a World Champion in volleyball in 1952, 1956, and 1960; and European Champion in 1949-51 and 1958, while taking silver at the 1955 European Championships. She also won seven Soviet titles, in 1947, 1951, 1955-56, 1960, and 1962-63; and won the Soviet Cup three times, in 1950-51 and 1953.

14517,Tommy Godwin,Male,5 November 1920,,, Great Britain,GBR,"Born to British parents in the USA, Tommy Godwin spent the first eleven years of his life in Connecticut before the family returned to England in 1932. After trying a variety of sports his talents as a cyclist were discovered whilst he was as delivery boy for the Wrenson grocery chain. At 16 he took a job at the BSA cycle factory in Birmingham and would build his own his racing frames as his career progressed. Godwin was in contention for the 1940 Olympic team until the outbreak of war and although, as an electrician, he was spared Army service, his best years were probably lost to World War II. Chosen for the team pursuit at the 1948 Olympics, he was added to the entry list for the kilometer time trial as a late replacement for bitter rival Reg Harris. Godwin won bronze medals in both events and was a little unlucky not to fare better in the kilo. Racing in near darkness, he was tied for the lead after the penultimate lap but a strong headwind in the finishing straight saw him drop a second and a half off the winner’s pace. He collected another bronze medal at the British Empire Games in 1950 before becoming a professional rider and in the same year opened the cycle shop that he ran for the next 36 years. Tommy’s pro career was not as successful as it could have been and his father, who acted as his manager, was accused of mismanaging his son’s schedule. Toomy took up coaching and was British team manager at the Tokyo Olympics as well as being personal coach to Olympic medalist Mick Bennett and World Amateur Road Race champion Graham Webb. Both Bennett and Webb were employed in Godwin’s shop during their amateur careers. Godwin later served as President of the British Cycling Federation and at the age of 89 was still fit enough to ride several laps of the Herne Hill Velodrome where he won his Olympic medals over 60 years previously.

Having been a substitute for the 1968 Grenoble Winter Olympics, Chiocchetti participated in 1972 and 1976. Chiocchetti was a member of the national team from 1965-76, and left in a controversial manner following the Innsbruck Olympics. He went off first in the relay and his time was bettered by 14 of the 15 other teams; only a Turkish competitor was slower than him. Although Italy finished seventh, Chiocchetti’s disastrous opening leg cost the Italians a podium finish, and possibly gold. In 1979 Chiocchetti won the 30 km at the Italian championships. He quit the sport competitively at the age of 40 to embark on a successful business career with his wife Giuliana Zeni, running the Hotel Piedibosco at Moena, overlooking the starting point of the “Marcialonga”.",

In 1959 she won the English Schools 100 yards title, while the following year she was the WAAA long jump champion and made her international debut against Italy in that event. In 1962, she was a finalist in the 200 metres at the European Championships and the 80 metres hurdles at the Commonwealth Games. When she turned her attention to the 400 metres in 1963, she ran a world class 53.6 in only her fourth race at the distance. For the Tokyo Olympics, Packer decided to concentrate on the 400 metres but she added a second string to her bow by trying the 800 metres early in 1964. In the Olympic 400 metres, although setting a European record of 52.0, she had to settle for the silver medal behind the Australian Betty Cuthbert, but then caused one of the major upsets of the Games in the 800 metres. She went to Tokyo with no experience at international 800 metres running and the Olympic heat was only her sixth race at the distance at any level. The eighth and final 800 metres race of her career was the 1964 Olympic final and with a devastating attack down the home straight, she broke the tape five metres clear in a new Olympic and European record of 2:01.1. Packer retired from the sport after the Tokyo Olympics at the age of 22, and she later married Robbie Brightwell, the silver medalist in the 4x400 metre relay.

Within four years she had joined the Canadian women’s national hockey team at the senior level and soon won a silver medal at the 1998 Winter Olympics, when women’s ice hockey was first made an official part of the program. At the tournament, as Canada’s youngest player, she suited up for six matches but did not score any goals. She also entered Harvard University that year, to earn a degree in psychology, and had a successful five-year tenure with their hockey squad that included a National Collegiate Athletic Association Championship victory in 1999 and stints as captain during the 2000-2001 and 2002-2003 seasons. Among the honors that she accrued during her collegiate career were a league MVP award in 1999 and the Patty Kazmaier Award as college ice hockey’s top female player, which she won in 2002 and 2003, making her the only person to capture the title twice. She also holds the NCAA scoring record with 319 points, having scored in all but one of her 107 games in the league.

Between 1908-12, Zachár was a member of the Hungarian national team in both sports, and at the 1908 London Olympics, won a silver medal as part of the 4 x 200 metres freestyle relay team. He also competed in the individual 400 metres freestyle, but failed to reach the final. At the 1912 Olympics, he finished fifth with the water polo team, and was again a member of 4 × 200 meter relay team, where they reached the final, but did not compete due to the exhaustion of a colleague, Béla Las-Torres. Zachár won three Hungarian freestyle titles, at 880 yards in 1907 and 1910, and 100 yards in the second of those years. He retired from competitive swimming in 1914 and pursued his career in banking. When he eventually retired he was a director of the Hungarian Mortgage Bank. In May 1951, Zachár was declared politically dangerous by the communist system of Mátyás Rákosi, and was moved from Budapest to Jászkisér, where he had to live in a former henhouse. His Budapest apartment was taken from him, and his pension withdrawn. In 1953 he moved to Őrbottyán, and stayed with his brother-in-law, as his ban from living in Budapest was still valid.

She first came to prominence as a high school sprint star in the early 90s. She narrowly missed making the 1992 U.S. Olympic team in the individual sprints as a high school senior, and she declined a place on the relay team. She then attended the University of North Carolina, where she starred as a point guard on the basketball team, and led the team to the NCAA Women’s Championship in 1994. She ran no international track while in college but returned to star at the 1997 World Championships when she won gold medals in the 100 meters and 4×100 metres relay. In 1998, she won 34 individual events, losing only a late season long jump competition. At the 1999 World Championships, she defended her title at 100 meters, but was injured in attempting to win the 200. Jones set herself the goal of winning five gold medals at the 2000 Olympic Games. She succeeded in winning five medals, three of them gold. The golds came in the 100, 200, and 4×400 metres relay, while she earned bronze medals in the long jump and 4×100 relay. She continued to compete after 2000, though never as successfully. Though she never tested positive in any drug test, she was hounded by rumors of doping after the Sydney Olympics. The rumors were exacerbated by her marriage to two athletes (C. J. Hunter and Tim Montgomery) who had both tested positive for performance-enhancing drugs (PEDs). In October 2007, after the fall-out of the BALCO investigation in the United States, Marion Jones confessed that she had lied to a grand jury when she stated that she had never taken PEDs.

He trusted in the coincidence of musical, physical, and emotional experiences. A variety of movement analogues are used for musical concepts, to develop an integrated and natural feel for musical expression. Turning the body into a well-tuned musical instrument, Jaques-Dalcroze felt, was the best path to generating a solid, vibrant musical foundation. Jaques-Dalcroze’s mother was an Italian singer. Born Émile Jaques, he later adopted Dalcroze as a double name. He studied in Genève, under Anton Bruckner in Wien (Vienna) and under Léo Delibes and Gabriel Fauré in Paris. As conductor at the theater in Algiers in 1886, he was fascinated by Arabic music. Appointed professor of music theory at the Genève Conservatoire in 1892, he developed his system of rhythmic gymnastics while there. In 1911, he founded the Institute of Music and Rhythm in Hellerau near Dresden. The school was visited by dancer Vaslav Nijinsky, amongst others, and attended by German expressionist dancer Mary Wigman. In the following year, the year of his participation, the first edition of his programmatic book The Eurythmics was published in London. In 1914, Jaques-Dalcroze returned to Genève, where he opened the Jaques-Dalcroze Institute in the following year. He directed the institute until his death. During his lifetime, he wrote 1,200 songs and piano pieces, many of which are still popular in Switzerland, as well as orchestral and chamber music and operas. He was appointed Officer of the Legion of Honor, became honorary citizen of Genève and was awarded the Genève Music Prize.",

In 1888 the family decided to make a new life in Scotland, but Dalglish’s father died before they could make the journey and his mother set sail with him and his five siblings the following year. Dalglish was educated at the Oratory school in Birmingham before going to the Royal Naval College at Osborne on the Isle of Wight, in January 1895.

In 1906, still only 14-years-old, Beaurepaire won the 220y and 440y freestyle at the Victorian championships. In 1908, he won Australian titles in the 440y, 880y and mile freestyles, qualifying for the Australian Olympic Team in London. In 1910 he won more than a dozen state and national championships and broke the world record for the 220y freestyle. That summer he toured Europe and England, winning 41 races on the tour and setting six world records in the process. In 1911 he took a break from competitive swimming and worked as a swimming instructor, which resulted in him being barred from the 1912 Olympics as a professional. That decision was reversed in 1914. In World War I, Beaurepaire served in the infantry for the Australian Defence Force. He was gassed and suffered with trench fever before being sent home. After the war, he competed at the 1920 and 1924 Olympics, winning bronze medals both years in the 1,500 freestyle, and leading Australia to silver medals both times in the 4x200 freestyle relay. Throughout his career, he set 15 world records, won 79 Victorian championships, 11 British championships, and a then record 34 Australian titles. In 1922, he rescued a shark attack victim near Sydney, for which he was awarded the Royal Humane Society Gold Medal and ₤550. He used the award to start Beaurepaires Tyre Company, and later added an offshoot, the Olympic Tyre and Rubber Company. Together the two had assets worth more than ₤8 million at his death in 1956. He served for 10 years in the Victorian Legislative Council (1942-52), and from 1940 until 1942 he was the Lord Mayor of Melbourne. In 1948 he was part of a delegation that went to London to lobby the IOC for Melbourne to host the 1956 Olympics. In 1949 Melbourne was selected to host the 1956 Olympic Games and Beaurepaire was re-elected as mayor so that he could preside over the Games.

He decided his own son, however, would be educated at Scaitcliffe school in Surrey. He went to Eton College in 1941, where his sporting interests were Eton Fives, boxing and fencing, in which he had an interest from an early age. He was made school captain at boxing and fencing in 1948. Upon going to Trinity Hall, Cambridge, Grose-Hodge won his fencing Blue and was regarded as an outstanding épéeist, but was equally at home with foil and sabre. His first major honour came in 1941 when he won the Public Schools Sabre Championship, a title he retained the following year. Grose-Hodge was both the 1947 National junior épée champion and Universities Athletic Union (UAU) foil champion, and in 1948 he was the UAU foil and épée champion. The following year he was National junior foil champion and third in the Amateur Épée Championship. In 1950 Grose-Hodge won the coveted International Miller-Hallett Challenge Cup at the London Fencing Club. Grose-Hodge went to the Helsinki Olympics as a member of the British épée team, but they were eliminated at the quarter-final stage. In 1944 Grose-Hodge joined the Army and was involved in bomb disposal. After the War, however, he returned to Cambridge before starting a distinguished career in the Civil Service, which included a posting to Hong Kong in 1952. During his time there he, and fellow Britons living in the area, formed the Hong Kong Fencing Club. Grose-Hodge was then posted to India in 1962 as First Secretary to the British High Commission, in New Delhi. Upon returning to England, Grose-Hodge fenced at the Lansdowne Fencing Club before joining the London Thames Fencing Club, and remained a member until shortly before his death in 1998. He became president of the Épée Club in 1989.",

His background was as colourful as the name suggested. His father, a former racer on the Cresta Run, had a reputation as a playboy and eloped to Las Vegas to marry his mother when she was just 18. The family settled in Ireland, where Clifton was born, but mother and son later moved to Spain after the death of his father in a car accident when he was just 2-years-old. He inherited the title of 6th Baron Wrottesley on the death of his grandfather in 1977. Wrottesley was educated at Eton School, Edinburgh University and Sandhurst Military Academy and spent 2 years in the British Army before becoming a stockbroker in the City of London. Baron Wrottesley began sliding on the Cresta Run in 1988 and became the most successful slider in the history of the track having the record number of victories in each of the St. Moritz track’s 4 classic races. Prior to the reinstatement of skeleton as an Olympic event in 2002 he joined the FIBT World Cup circuit in 2000 and competed for the next two seasons without getting close to a podium finish. The Park City track used for the 2002 Olympics seemed to suit his style of sliding as, to general surprise, he stood in the bronze medal position after the first of the two runs. A poor start to his 2nd run wrecked his medal chances though he remained in 4th position which was easily the best ever finish by an Irish Winter Games competitor. Although Baron Wrottesley continued to compete on the Cresta Race the 2002 Olympics marked the end of his career at the top level of the sport and he returned to the business of property and vintage wine. The Baron served as chef de mission for the Irish team at the 2006 Winter Games but later switched countries to become chairman of British Skeleton. He married a daughter of the billionaire Swiss financier Urs Schwarzenbach.",Listed in Olympian Members of the Nobility (6th Baron Wrottesley)

A powerful centre-half Charlie was introduced to Erith & Belvedere by his father, who played for the club in the 1920’s, and made his début the month before his 18th birthday. Charlie was an ever-present in Erith & Belvedere’s 13-match run to the 1938 FA Amateur Cup final which they lost to Bromley. At the time Charlie was a month away from his 19th birthday. He played around 100 games for the Deres before joining Walthamstow Avenue in the summer of 1938. He served in the Royal Artillery during the war and after the hostilities joined Bromley and captained them to victory over Romford in front of 95,000 fans in the first FA Amateur Cup final at Wembley in 1949 – his brother Tommy played in the same team. He turned down offers to turn professional, including one from an Italian, and consequently was honoured to captain the Great Britain side at the 1952 Olympics. Sadly, Britain were beaten in a qualifying match by Luxembourg three days before the opening ceremony. After the Games he returned to Erith & Belvedere as player-manager and was joined by brother Tommy. Charles Fuller’s playing career came to an end after twisting a knee in match against Grays in 1954, but he continued as manager until 1956 when he was replaced after a poor start to the season.

It starts with a fanfare motif. The narrator (baritone) urges the Olympic competitors to abide the rules of the competition. They answer in unison with an oath. Höffer’s first teacher was his father who taught him piano and organ. After initially being educated as a teacher, Höffer studied music in Köln (Cologne) and, after World War I, in Berlin. From 1923 Höffer taught as a piano teacher at an orchestra school, and in 1933 was named a Professor in Berlin. During the Nazi regime he was supported by Reichsminister Joseph Goebbels. He was on the divine list of the most important composers of the Nazi era. After World War II Höffer became director of the High School for Music in Berlin-Charlottenburg. In the center of his interest was choral music, in which he was very active. At the same time, he turned to the new medium of radio, in which he saw innovative communication possibilities.",

In 1942, he was transferred to the Salaspils concentration camp near Riga and the following year to the Stutthof camp near Danzig (Gdansk). There Łapiński worked in the camp’s painting squad; among other things, he copied paintings from galleries for SS men, but also had the opportunity to record the camp life in drawings. He also survived the “death march”, the evacuation of the Stutthof camp. After the war, Łapiński documented his experiences in paintings and drawings. These are now in the collection of the Stutthof Museum. After the liberation, Łapiński settled in Wejherowo near Gdansk and was employed by the city administration. From 1947, he studied under Juliusz Studnicki at the State College of Fine Arts in Sopot (later Gdansk). He graduated in 1956 and became a member of the Association of Polish Artists and Designers. In 1963 Łapiński moved to Elbląg. There he participated in exhibitions of the local group of artists but did not follow the avant-garde trends. He won the first Elbląg trophy in a competition announced by the local cultural association and subsequently received several awards. Łapiński painted mainly landscapes and nudes, characterized by a calm, balanced, slightly blurred color composition. He also created drawings and prints, occasionally sculptures. In addition, he designed and supervised the erection of monuments commemorating the prisoners of the Stutthof camp. Nevertheless, he was little known to the public. Between 1965-1971, Łapiński worked as an art teacher at the House of Culture, and from 1975-1978, at the Elbląg Museum. Due to health problems, he received an invalid pension, but remained creatively active until the end of his life, despite the gradual loss of his eyesight. Since 1945, he was a member of the “Alliance of Democrats”, a so-called “satellite” party, and from 1970, also of the official veterans’ association “Association of Fighters for Freedom and Democracy”. The title of the charcoal drawing Friedensfahrt (Peace Race) probably refers to the multiple-stage bicycle race of the same name in Central Europe. Until the political upheaval in the former Eastern Bloc countries in 1989, it was the most important amateur bicycle race internationally.",Listed in Olympians Who Survived Nazi Concentration Camps (Salaspils concentration camp and Stutthof concentration camp)

35165,George Patton,Male,11 November 1885,,, United States,USA,"George Smith Patton, Jr. was one the greatest military generals ever produced in the United States. Born in San Gabriel, California on 11 November 1885, he was from a wealthy family. He eventually married into more wealth, his wife, Beatrice Ayer, being the daughter of a Massachusetts textile magnate. After attending school in Pasadena, Patton enrolled at the Virginia Military Institute. From there he went to the United States Military Academy at West Point. He graduated from West Point in 1909, and was commissioned as a second lieutenant. Efforts to find much about Patton’s athletic career have yielded little. At West Point he went out for football, but broke both his arms and never played. He ran on the track team and apparently set a school record in the hurdles in his senior year. He competed in the broadswords at West Point, earning letters in his senior year in track & field, fencing, and sharpshooting (rifle and pistol). He never competed nationally in track & field or in fencing. In addition to those three sports, Patton was an accomplished horseman. With the family’s background he had grown up with horses, and became an well-known polo player. With his ability in running, fencing, shooting, and riding, Patton was a natural to represent the United States in the first Olympic modern pentathlon event at the Stockholm Olympics. Still, almost nothing is known about how he was selected to the team, as he had little national reputation. After graduation from the USMA, Patton served in the cavalry in Fort Sheridan, Illinois until December 1911. He kept a whole stable of polo ponies with him at his own expense. He was then transferred to Fort Myer, Virginia, where he was stationed when selected for the 1912 Olympic team. There he competed in polo with the elite and wealthy, and Wilson notes that he hobnobbed with the influential and powerful. It is possible that Patton’s new circle of friends had some influence in helping him be selected to the 1912 U.S. Olympic team. At Stockholm, Patton finished fifth in the modern pentathlon. It is also commonly stated that he also competed in fencing at the 1912 Olympics. While he was entered in that sport (in individual sabre), there is no evidence that he competed in fencing at the 1912 Olympic Games. The first event of the 1912 modern pentathlon was shooting, and Patton performed poorly, finishing only 21st. It cost him a chance at a gold medal, as he performed credibly in the last four contests. In swimming, probably the sport at which he had the least experience, he was seventh. He placed fourth in fencing and sixth in cross-country riding. He had moved up to sixth place with only the 4,000 metre run remaining. He did well there, placing third in the run, and moving up to fifth spot. But the deficit he had built for himself in the shooting was too much for him to overcome. There is no record that George Patton ever again competed in organized sports after the Stockholm Olympics. Thus, he has one of the shortest athletic careers of any well-known American Olympian. His “career,” as it were, consisting mostly of military training while at West Point, and then the 1912 Olympics. But George Smith Patton was destined for far greater fame than he would achieve on the playing fields. During World War I, he served as a member of General John Pershing’s staff. In November 1917 he was assigned to the Tank Corps, and attended a course at the French Tank School. He eventually became known, among many other things, for his brilliance in commanding tanks in battle. Between World Wars, Patton had various assignments in many different locations, as is common with military personnel. But the bulk of his fame rests on his performance as a commanding general during World War II. On 19 April 1941, Patton was assigned to be the Commanding Officer of the 2nd Armored Division at Fort Benning, Georgia. He later became Commanding General of the Armored Corps. When American forces landed in North Africa on 3 November 1942, Patton commanded the units landing on the west coast. In February 1943, he became Commanding General of the Western Task Force and later assumed command all American ground forces in the Tunisian Combat Area. Patton was given command of the American Seventh Army in Sicily in July 1943. There he led a controversial charge across Sicily, probably disobeying orders from headquarters to only support British Field Marshal Sir Bernard Law Montgomery. In March 1944, he was put in charge of the Third Army in France. Commanding that Army, he was instrumental in helping the Americans win the Battle of the Bulge, when his Army marched over two days and nights through terrible weather, to relieve and support beleaguered American troops that were meeting significant German resistance in Bastogne. Patton is probably best remembered today in the United States because of an Academy Award-winning movie of his life, entitled simply “Patton.” The movie detailed his controversial command during World War II. Known as “Blood and Guts,” his command style was tyrannical and swashbuckling, and he himself stated that he had no political ambitions, nor acumen. He was known for his attacking style of command, stating many times in his fluent French, “L’attaque, l’attaque, toujours l’attaque.” He was vilified by the American press after the war because he refused to support the Soviets, but in retrospect many of his comments seem to have been prescient. His awards for his military career were numerous and included the following: Distinguished-Service Cross with one Oak-Leaf Cluster, Distinguished-Service Medal with two Oak-Leaf Clusters, Distinguished Service Medal (Navy), the Legion of Merit, the Silver Star, the Congressional Life Saving Medal of Honor, the Bronze Star Medal, the Purple Heart, the Mexican Service Badge, and the Victory Medal with four stars. He was also awarded the following foreign decorations: Medal Commemorative of the Volymored (Sweden), Order of the British Empire (Great Britain), Most Honorable Order of the Bath (Great Britain), Grand Cross of Ouissan Alaouite (Morocco), Grand Officer of the Order of Leopold with Palm (Belgium), Croix de Guerre (Belgium), Order of Adolphe of Nassau, Grand Croix (Luxembourg), Croix de Guerre (Luxembourg), Order of Kutusov (Soviet Union), and he was given the rank of Commander in the Legion of Honor (France). After the War ended, Patton was placed in charge of the 15th Army in American-Occupied Germany. Sadly, while in that command he was involved in an automobile accident on the Frankfurt-Mannheim Highway and was rendered a quadriplegic. He died a few weeks later in Heidelberg on 21 December 1945.",

He participated at the 1924 Winter Olympics in Chamonix finishing sixth in the 18 km run but did not finish in the 50 km. Nevertheless he achieved his best results over the long distances. At the next Winter Olympics in St. Moritz, he won the 50 km event ahead of his compatriot Gustaf Jonsson by a great margin of 13:27, unequaled in Olympic history. Before the Games the ladies at home sewed a white ski suit for Hedlund, which was lighter than the official Swedish outfit, and was very suitable under the prevailing warm conditions, but he was almost disqualified by the team management, because he refused to wear the Swedish blue. However, as he did so well in the Olympics, the suit was considered to bring luck, and since then, the Swedish cross-country team has worn white outfits at the Winter Olympics. At the 1933 Nordic World Ski Championships he was part of the Swedish relay team that won the title. He also won the famous Vasa run in 1926 and 1928. Sweden’s best two skiers, Sven Utterström and Per-Erik Hedlund, were best friends and wanted to share the victory in the 1928 race. They went side-by-side over the line but Hedlund was declared winner after a jury meeting, causing Utterström and Hedlund to refuse to accept the jury’s decision, angrily handing back their prizes. Hedlund won nine individual Swedish Championships over various distances with six in the 50 km event, which was in fact a 60 km event until 1926. He received the Svenska Dagbladet Gold Medal in 1928. Hedlund was described as “rough as a horse, agile as a squirrel and with lungs like a hound”. During his active time, he worked six days a week in the woods and went skiing on the seventh. Rumor has it that he sometimes he went skiing to the venues or often skied to trains that went to the venue.","Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the World Nordic Ski Championships (2–0–0 1928 St. Moritz (Olympics) CCS gold: 50 km; 1933 Innsbruck CCS gold: 4×10 km relay) Listed in Olympians Who Won the Vasaloppet (1926 (5-36:07) first under six hours; 1928 (5-33:23, tied with Sven Utterström))"

With his longtime partner, Cesare Beltrami, he placed sixth in K-2 1000 and K-4 1000 at the Tokyo Olympics, and eighth in K-2 1000 in 1968 at Mexico City. Zilioli competed at the European Championships in both 1967 and 1968. He is most famous for an episode that occurred at the 1963 World Championships in the K-2 10,000 race. Zilioli was paired with Beltrami when they came upon the Hungarian crew of Istvàn Timàr-Geng and Làszlò Fàbiàn, who had lost their paddle. Zilioli recovered it and returned it to the legitimate owners who went on to win, while they only finished in seventh place due to a broken rudder. After the award ceremony, Fabian took the medal from his neck and gave it to Zilioli, who for his gesture, years later, was awarded by Panathlon International with the Fair Play Award, named after Pierre, Baron de Coubertin. After the Mexico City Olympics and winning four races at the Italian Championships, Ziloli left active sport. He remained in Cremona as custodian of Canottieri Baldesio until 1979. The Municipality then hired him as an assistant bather at the Cremona swimming pool, and he then moved with his family to Sabaudia where he worked in a boatyard.",

94424,Serena Williams,Female,26 September 1981,175.0,70, United States,USA,"Serena Williams is often considered the GOAT of women’s tennis. Her Olympic record is but a blip on her overall dominance of tennis in the 21st century. She won four Olympic gold medals, with a singles win in 2012 and three doubles gold medals in 2000 2008, and 2012, playing with her sister, Venus. Serena also played singles and doubles at the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Olympics. Through 2022 Serena Williams had won 23 Grand Slam tournaments, with seven wins at the Australian Open, three wins at the French Open, seven Wimbledon titles, and six US Open victories. Her 23 major championships rank second all-time among women, trailing only Margaret Court’s 24, but Court won many of those in the Australian Open in an era when few top players traveled to Australia to compete in that event. Serena’s only challenger for dominance in Grand Slams is likely Steffi Graf, who won 22 Grand Slams, including a 1988 Golden Slam, when she won all four majors and an Olympic gold medal. Williams won almost $100 million in prize money during her career. Including all tournaments, she won 73 WTA events. She rarely played doubles outside of the Grand Slams, yet she won 14 Grand Slam doubles titles, winning all of them while playing with Venus. She did win six other WTA doubles titles, all but one with Venus, the other while playing with Alexandra Stevenson. Serena also won the 1998 Wimbledon and US Open mixed doubles, playing with Max Mirnyi. Williams held the #1 ranking for 316 weeks, including 186 consecutive weeks from February 2013 to September 2016. She accomplished this despite overcoming several health issues in her career, and taking time off while pregnant. Coached by her father, Richard Williams, Serena skipped most junior tournaments as did Venus, and they just trained on their own. She started playing the WTA Tour in 1998 at age 17 and won her first Grand Slam in 1999 at the US Open, with her first WTA title occurring in February of that year at the Open GDF Suez in France. Her last Grand Slam title came at the 2017 Australian Open, a span of 18 years, after which she was out for a year while having a baby. Her last victory of any sort came at the 2020 New Zealand Open, defeating Jessica Pegula in the final. Serena and her sister, Venus, did all this as the first African-American female champions since Althea Gibson in the 1950s, and overcoming the prejudice which that engendered in the tennis world. Serena never really announced her retirement from competitive tennis, and hinted that she likely never would, but she played what seemed to be her last Grand Slam event at 2021 Wimbledon, when she lost in the first round at age 40.","Sister of Venus Williams Listed in Olympians With a Net Worth > $100M ($170M (The Richest, 2019)) Listed in Olympians Who Were Named Champion des champions de L'Équipe (2012 (women), 2013 (women), 2015 (women)) Listed in Olympians Who Were Named Sports Illustrated's Sportsman of the Year (21 Grand Slam titles (1999-2015), four Olympic gold medals (2000-12), 2015 Sports Illustrated Sportsperson of the Year) Listed in Olympians Who Won a Laureus World Sports Award (Won Sportswoman of the Year in 2003, 2010, 2016, 2018) Listed in Olympians Who Won a Golden Slam in Tennis (Singles: Australian Open (2003, 2005, 2007, 2009-10, 2015, 2017), French Open (2002, 2013, 2015), Wimbledon (2002-03, 2009-10, 2012, 2015-16), US Open (1999, 2002, 2008, 2012-14), Olympics (2012); Doubles: Australian Open (2001, 2003, 2009-10), French Open (1999, 2010), Wimbledon (2000, 2002, 2008-09, 2012, 2016), US Open (1999, 2009), Olympics (2000, 2008, 2012)) Listed in Olympic Champions Who Have Played in a Fed Cup Final Winning Team (Olympic Gold - 2000 / 2008 / 2012; Fed Cup - 1999) Listed in Olympians Who Were Awarded the Prix Monique Berlioux (2013)"

He started his career in 1953 with the Aufbau Börde Magdeburg club, but rode from 1956 to the end of his career for the Sportclub Deutsche Hochschule für Körperkultur Leipzig. He was so popular that from 1953-61 he was voted East German Athlete of the Year for nine consecutive years. Schur first came to international prominence in 1955, winning the Friedensfahrt (Peace Race), at the time the top stage race for amateurs, and he repeated that title in 1959. In 1958-59 he became the first cyclist to defend the amateur world championship road race, placing second in 1960 when he allowed his teammate, Bernhard Eckstein, through for the win. At the Olympics Schur won a bronze medal in 1956 in the team road race, and a silver in 1960 in the team time trial, although his son, Jan, won a gold medal at the 1988 Olympics in the team time trial. Schur won 14 East German titles on the road and in the individual time trial, won the Tour of East Germany in 1953-54, 1959, and 1961, the Tour du Harz in 1955-56 and 1959-60, the Tour Around Berlin in 1951 and the Tour du Sachsenring in 1958.

Therefore the teams had to fight hard and the East German team consisting of Günter Lörke, Egon Adler, Erich Hagen, and Schur lost Lörke early in the race. Nevertheless the team won the silver medal behind Italy. The race was overshadowed by the death of Knud Enemark Jensen from Denmark, today widely seen as one of the first drug misuse deaths caused by doping substances. At the time of German unification, Schur was voted the greatest ever East German athlete. Also active politically, he was a member of the Volkskammer, the East German Parliament, from 1959-90, and after unification, was a member of the German Bundestag from 1998-2002.","Father of Jan Schur Listed in Olympians With Asteroids Named After Them (38976 Taeve) Listed in Olympians Who Were Elected East German Athlete of the Year (1953, 1954, 1955, 1956, 1957, 1958, 1959, 1960, 1961) Listed in Olympians Who Were Members of National Legislatures (Member of East German Volkskammer 1958 through 1990 (FDJ, SED, PDS).

17949,"Thomas, Lord Howard de Walden",Male,9 May 1880,181.0,77, Great Britain,GBR,"Thomas, Lord Howard de Walden is one of the few Britons to have competed in two sports at different Olympics. A keen fencer, who could fence with both hands, he was at one time the president of the Amateur Fencing Association, and competed in the individual foil event at the 1906 Athens Games and two years later on home water, took part in the short-lived Olympic motorboating competition. Lord de Walden was involved in motorboating from the early days of the sport and was owner of some of the best known boats of the day. His most successful was Daimler II, normally driven by Alfred Fentiman, and in 1908 they challenged for the Harmsworth Trophy at Huntington Bay, New York but were beaten by the American boat Dixie II. The following month, Fentiman and de Walden teamed up at the London Olympics but their entry Dylan only took part in the first of two races in the A-Class race which was abandoned due to bad weather at Southampton Water. Lord Howard de Walden was born as Thomas Evelyn Ellis in 1890 and at the age of 19 he became the 8th Lord following his father’s death. He acceded to the seat about seven weeks before his very good friend, motorboating enthusiast and fellow Olympian, Hugh Grosvenor became the 2nd Duke of Westminster. In 1917, with permission granted from the King, Lord Howard de Walden was allowed to add the name Scott to his surname and he became Thomas Scott-Ellis. Educated at Eton and the Royal Military College at Sandhurst, Lord de Walden shortly afterwards obtained a commission with the 10th Hussars and served in the Boer War in 1899-1900. During World War I he served with the Royal Tank Corps rising to the rank of Major and Brevet Lieutenant-Colonel before being made an honorary Colonel in 1927 and then obtaining a similar rank in the 4th/5th Battalion, Royal Scots Fusiliers. Between 1938-46 he was a trustee of the Tate Gallery where he owned many acres of land and property in prime central London locations. Lord de Walden’s sporting interests extended beyond fencing and motorboating. He was a lover of sailing and was a member of the Royal Yacht Squadron. He was also a keen supporter of horseracing and was a member of the Jockey Club from 1905-24 and owned some quality horses, including the successful Zindanfel and Rose en Soleil, who was named after one of his racing motor boats. In 1933 his horses won 17 races and more than £10,000 in prize money. Howard de Walden was also very proficient at falconry. His talents extended even further to writing books, plays, operettas and even children’s pantomimes, and his wife Margherita was, like him, an expert fencer An article in Autocar magazine in 1907 relates a story about Lord Howard de Walden during a motorboat meeting at Ryde, Isle of Wight. The Lord and his driver Alfred Fentiman were making repairs to Daimler II. Clad in greasy overalls, they were asked by a lady to escort her and her belongings to the Portsmouth ferry as she believed they were a pair of pier hands. The Lord duly agreed and on carrying out his duty, was rewarded with one shilling. Not short of a shilling or two, the extremely wealthy de Walden raised his hat and went on his way to realise some time later that he had inadvertently escorted the lady to the wrong ferry.","Listed in Olympian Members of the Nobility (8th Lord Howard de Walden, 4th Baron Seaford)"

920613,"Pierre, Baron de Coubertin",Male,1 January 1863,,, France  Germany,FRA,"Pierre, Baron de Coubertin, served as the 2nd President of the International Olympic Committee, but his importance in the Olympic Movement far overshadows that simple statement. Although recent scholarship has shown that he was not the only person who had the idea to begin international Olympic Games, he is certainly the person still mostly responsible for the revival of the Olympic Games in 1896. For this effort, he is correctly termed le rénovateur. Born in Paris as Pierre Frédy on 1 January 1863, he was descended from a noble line that had lived in France for over 500 years. After his preliminary studies he entered law school in 1884 although he never intended to practice law, and he left after one year, enrolling instead in the École libre de sciences politiques. Coubertin had early on decided that his goal would be the reform of the French educational system. He based this reform on ideas he had gleaned from visits to England, observing their educational system, the first of which occurred in 1883. From England, Coubertin learned of Thomas Arnold’s theory about the principal element in English male education: sports. Arnold had become headmaster of Rugby School in 1828 and, although not an innovator in teaching methods, his aim was to reform Rugby School by making it a school for gentlemen. Coubertin studied his system of school sports, student self-government, and post-graduate athletic associations, and hoped to incorporate them into the French educational system. During the 1880s school sport competitions started in Paris. For the first time, high school students played football (soccer). Shortly thereafter, the Racing Club de France was founded, with Coubertin as an officer of the club. In 1888 Coubertin published the results of his studies on the British educational system, which were more or less a reflection of Arnold’s theories. Coubertin next formed a committee designed to be responsible for physical education in schools. The committee was mostly run by Coubertin, but found little support among the French public. In July 1889 Coubertin traveled to the United States and Canada to visit several universities, colleges, and high schools, to examine the structure of North American educational systems and sporting organizations. On his return Coubertin traveled again to England where he met William Penny Brookes, who had started a series of sporting festivals in rural England, which he called the Much Wenlock Olympian Games. From Brookes, Coubertin also learned of a series of sporting festivals in Athens, termed the Zappas Olympic Games. Spurred by these findings, and hearing of multiple archaeological discoveries in ancient Olympia between 1875 and 1881, Coubertin became enthralled with the idea of re-establishing the Olympic Games as a modern international sporting festival. In studying the ancient Olympics, Coubertin thought that at least one reason for the flowering of Greece during the so-called Golden Age had been sport and the ideal of the Olympic Games. In November 1892 Coubertin organized a conference at the Sorbonne in which he discussed the history of sports and the possibility of renewing the Olympic Games. At this conference he made his now famous proposal, “Let us export rowers, runners, and fencers; there is the free trade of the future, and on the day when it is introduced within the walls of old Europe the cause of peace will have received a new mighty stay. This is enough to encourage your servant to dream now about the second part of his program: he hopes that you will help him as you have helped him hitherto, and that with you he will be able to continue and complete, on a basis suited to the conditions of modern life, this grandiose and salutary task, the restoration of the Olympic Games.” But his message fell on deaf ears. There was no support for the idea in France in 1892. Coubertin refused to give up. He arranged another conference at the Sorbonne for June 1894, this time inviting a more international gathering of delegates. The theme of the conference was ostensibly to discuss the role of amateurism in sport, but Coubertin secretly had planned to broach the idea of reviving the Olympic Games once again, a topic which he added to the end of the program, and he was finally successful. The delegates voted to re-establish the Olympic Games as an international sporting festival, and to begin the festival in 1896 in Athens. In addition, the conference formed the International Olympic Committee to oversee the Olympic Games. Coubertin felt that the President of the IOC should reside in the nation hosting the next Olympic Games, thus he established Demetrios Vikelas in the post. With the 1900 Olympic Games scheduled for Coubertin’s hometown of Paris, Coubertin took over as President of the IOC in 1896, and remained in the post until he voluntarily resigned in 1925. For those 29 years, he was the International Olympic Committee, and the Olympic Movement. Most of the philosophy of Olympism, the structure of the Olympic Movement, and many of the major ideas of the Olympic Games came through him. He had little help, as an Executive Board to assist him in decisions was not formed until 1921. In addition, much of the money used to run the IOC, and publish material related to the committee and the Olympic Games, came from Coubertin’s personal fortune. Sadly, he greatly depleted this fortune in the effort, and struggled financially in the last years of his life, as did his widow, who survived him by over 30 years. Coubertin published copiously during his lifetime, and wrote extensively on the idea of the Olympic Games and the Olympic Movement. Much of the philosophy of Olympism is derived from his writings, although Coubertin defined that philosophy in several different ways. For him, it consisted of internationalism, fair play in sports, and sport for all. Modern sports scholars consider that Coubertin envisioned the Olympic Movement as a peace movement, attempting to bring together the peoples of the world in peaceful competition. Coubertin’s ideals formed the modern Olympic Movement, except for his attitude towards women in sports. He never supported the idea at all and resisted allowing women to compete at the Olympic Games. Fortunately, the IOC changed this dramatically after he stepped down as President in 1925. Coubertin moved the headquarters of the IOC to Lausanne, Switzerland in 1915, living there until 1933 when he settled in Genève. After the 1924 Olympic Games in Paris, he never attended another Olympics. But at Berlin in 1936, his voice was recorded and his famous statement concerning the Olympics was announced to the crowd of over 100,000 at the Opening Ceremony, “The important thing in the Olympic Games is not winning but taking part. Just as in life, the aim is not to conquer but to struggle well.” Coubertin’s personal life outside of the Olympics was not nearly as successful, and it is possible that later in life he used the Olympic idea as an escape from his troubles. In 1895 he had married Marie Rothan, the daughter of family friends, and they had several happy and successful years, but their later years were marred by the sad fates of their children. The first-born, Jacques, suffered mild brain damage after his parents left him in the sun too long when he was a little child. Their daughter suffered emotional disturbances, never married, and never found peace in her life. Marie and Pierre de Coubertin blamed each other and tried to console themselves with two nephews who became substitutes for their own children, but the nephews were killed at the front in World War I, ending the ancient Coubertin line with the death of Pierre de Coubertin. Pierre, Baron de Coubertin, le rénovateur of the modern Olympic Games, died while walking in a park in Genève on 2 September 1937. He was buried in the Bois de Vaux in Lausanne, almost within sight of the present IOC headquarters, but per his wishes, his heart was removed from his body and buried near the site of the Ancient Olympic stadium, where it had always beat. De Coubertin won the gold medal in literature under the pseudonyms Georges Hohrod (FRA) and Martin Eschbach (GER), both names of neighboring villages of the home of his parents-in-law in Alsace. From 1871 until the end of World War I, Alsace was part of Germany. Seven years after the Stockholm Games, he himself admitted this fact. He submitted the poem Ode au Sport in German and French. Even today historians speculate who wrote the German text, because de Coubertin was not fluent in German.",Granduncle of Geoffroy de Navacelle Listed in Olympians With Asteroids Named After Them (2190 Coubertin) Listed in Olympian Members of the Nobility (Baron) Listed in IOC Members of the Nobility (Baron)

Leepin arrived in England in the early 1890’s and, by now using the name George Lind, took up work as a cabinet maker in the small Lancashire town of Heywood. Lind joined the Salford Harriers in 1893 and began an association with the club that was highlighted by his appearance in the Salford team that placed third at the National Cross Country Championships in 1895. It appears that Lind retired from the track around the turn of the century and no record of him has been found until, by then having moved to London, he reappears in 1907 as a member of the London based Polytechnic Harriers club. No Russian Olympic Committee existed in 1908 so it was as a private entry that Lind became the athlete to represent Russia at Olympic level when he finished a creditable 19th in the Marathon at the London Olympics. Lind competed in Sweden after the Olympics and later in 1908 he returned to the White City Olympic Stadium to take part in 24 hour walking race. An injury ruined the 1909 season for him and his athletic career appears to have ended at this point. Having gained British citizenship in 1912 he worked as a timber inspector for the Ministry of Munitions during World War One and visited the USA in this capacity. He died in 1957.

At the Empire Games, he finished second in his opening heat of the 1000 yard sprint to Australian Horace Pethybridge, the eventual silver medalist, and was eliminated. Turner then earned consideration for a spot on Canada’s delegation to the 1936 Summer Olympics by emerging victorious in a 100 km trial race in Toronto, but initially there were insufficient funds to send him to Berlin. Eventually, however, his military unit, the First Field Company of the Royal Canadian Engineers, as well as his family and friends, pulled together enough money to send him overseas. At the Games, he crashed with 10 miles to go in the road race and, although he finished the race despite an injured arm, his final time was not recorded. He also competed in the team pursuit and placed ninth among thirteen teams, alongside Lionel Coleman, George Crompton, and Bob McLeod. After the Olympics, Turner continued his service with the Royal Canadian Engineers and took part in World War II, rising to the rank of Captain. He survived the conflict, but his brother Jean Albert Mark Turner of the Royal Canadian Air Force, was presumed killed in action. George returned to Ottawa after the war and died relatively young, at the age of 50.",

In 1973, when still only 18-years-of-age, Minchillo represented Italy against the United States and was knocked out in the first round of his bout with Sugar Ray Leonard, perhaps the greatest welterweight of all time. In 1975 Minchillo joined the Cagliari police force and went on to win the Italian amateur welterweight title. He later won the middleweight gold medal at the Mediterranean Games by beating the Yugoslav Zivorad Jelisijevic in the final. The following year Minchillo represented Italy at the Montréal Olympics, where he was defeated by the eventual bronze medallist, Germany’s Reinhard Skricek. The decision to award the bout to the German was not well received by the crowd. Minchillo turned pro in 1977 with Umberto Branchini’s team and won his first 17 bouts until the run was ended by Alvaro Scarpelli after receiving an injury in the fourth round. At Pesaro in 1979, Minchillo won the Italian super-welterweight title by knocking out Clemente Gessi in the first round. Minchillo defended the title four times. Minchillo won the European title in 1981 against the French-Algerian Louis Acariès, and subsequently gave up his Italian title. Also in 1981, Minchillo fought the Panamanian Roberto Durán at Caesars Palace, Las Vegas, but lost on points in ten rounds. Just two months later he defended his European title by knocking out Frenchman Claude Martin after just fifteen seconds of the contest. After other successful defences of his European title, Minchillo got his first opportunity to fight for the WBC super-welterweight world title in 1984 against the American Thomas Hearns in Detroit. Hearns won with a unanimous verdict. Minchillo got a second world title opportunity when the undefeated WBA champion Mike McCallum of Jamaica agreed to fight him in Milano. The Italian was again unlucky when beaten with a technical knockout in the 13th round. Married to a French girl and father of three children, Minchillo’s last of 60 pro bouts was at Rimini for the vacant European Super-welterweight title in January 1988. After the end of his fighting career, Minchillo ran his own gym in the city of Pesaro, where he died in September 2023 following a heart attack.",Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the Mediterranean Games (1–0–0 1975 Al-Jaza'ir BOX gold: welterweight -67 kg)

After a stay in Paris, he turned away from the commercial art field and then dedicated himself to outdoor painting. As a result, Josef Urbach took up studies at the Academy of Fine Arts in Karlsruhe. After World War I, Urbach was a member of the “Young Rhineland” and entered the “Rheinische Sezession” in 1929. With his paintings, Urbach followed the traditions of Expressionism with a Rhenish imprint. In 1923, he was named professor at the Folkwang School in Essen. Urbach took over classes for sketching, nude and portrait painting. In addition to his educational work, he received numerous orders from industry and commerce. As Urbach’s images were classified as “degenerate” by the Nazis in the 1930s, they were removed from the Folkwang Museum. A bomb attack destroyed his studio in 1943 and destroyed all of his previous works. From 1950-68 he then produced a variety of watercolors, sketches, and lithographs, while finishing only a few paintings in oil and acrylic. Some of his watercolors of the Racecourse in Neuß were created only after the war. Surviving from the pre-war period is, for instance, an oil painting entitled Derby or Horse Racing from 1926.",

Originally an engineer with the Standard Motor Company he competed internationally competition between 1956 and 1962 with his career highlight being a victory in the 110 yards backstroke at the 1962 British Empire Games in Australia. He also won an Empire Games bronze with the English medley relay team in 1958 and silver in the same event in 1962. His best Olympic performance came in 1956 where he finished sixth in the 100m backstroke final and failed narrowly to reach the final of that event in 1962. Sykes was captain of the British swimming team for the Roma Olympics and swam the lead-off leg for the medley relay team that took seventh place. He won seven British titles at 110 and 220 yards and was national record holder at 100y, 110y and 100m. Sykes retired from international competition in 1962 though he continued to compete at regional level and continued his involvement with the sport as an official for many years. He later helped to develop the SportSystems race management software system.","Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the British Empire/Commonwealth Games (1–1–1 1958 Cardiff SWI bronze: 4×110 yards medley (competed for England); 1962 Perth SWI gold: 110 yards backstroke, silver: 4×110 yards medley (competed for England))"
39701,Hans Bourquin,Male,30 May 1914,,, Switzerland,SUI,"Although barely 14-years-old Hans Bourquin coxed Swiss rowers Karl and Hans Schöchlin to the gold medal in the coxed pairs at the 1928 Amsterdam Olympics. At the time, Bourquin was among the youngest Olympic gold medalists. In the opening round, France’s trio of Henri Préaux and brothers Armand and Édouard Marcelle emerged as contenders, and the Swiss were able to eke out a victory by only two-tenths of a second. With France defeating the Americans in the repêchage, the stage was set for a Switzerland-France rematch in the final, as these two nations were clearly superior to the rest of the field. Italy dropped out in the quarterfinals, however, essentially giving the Swiss team a walkover in the semifinals and allowing them to conserve their strength, while the French crew were forced to face the Belgians for a second time. Thus the final was more decisive, with an exhausted French trio unable to keep up with the Swiss, who captured the gold medal. Belgium took home bronze by default, having no one to compete against in a third-place race.",

With Kendal being in the heart of England’s Lake District, it was of no surprise that Howard soon had a fascination with the hills and mountains around him. Educated at Rugby School, he then went to Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge where he studied natural sciences. He went on to become a medical student at University College Hospital. During World War I, Somervell was a captain in the Royal Army Medical Corps (RAMC) and was mentioned in dispatches. Somervell was chosen to join two Mount Everest expeditions and during his first attempt in 1922, along with George Mallory and Edward Norton, reached 26,895 feet (8,198m), just 2,134 feet (650m) from the summit. Two years later, Somervell accompanied Norton on a push for the summit but was forced to stop with severe pain in his throat. Norton carried on a little further before he too was forced to give in to the elements., but not before he had reached 28,200 feet (8,595m), and was within 909 feet (277m). It was on the 1924 expedition that Somervell bravely rescued four Sherpas marooned on the North Col. In between his two expeditions, Somervell volunteered to be a surgeon at the London Missionary Society’s hospitals in Neyyoor, India. He became the official head of the hospitals and stayed with them for 22 years, until retiring in 1945. Upon retiring, he was in great demand as a speaker to university students. Somervell was a fine musician and artist, and was president of the Alpine Club 1961-64 and once, during a six weeks holidays in the Alps, he climbed 32 local peaks.",

In 1954, he was instrumental in having Tokyo host the World Freestyle Wrestling Championship and 10 years later, the 1964 Olympics.

920896,Carlo Pellegrini,Male,25 October 1866,,, Italy,ITA,"Italian painter, drawer and illustrator Carlo Pellegrini won the gold medal at the 1912 Stockholm Olympic Games in the Art Competitions, category Paintings with his work Winter Sports. This was the only medal awarded to a painter in Stockholm. Living in Switzerland since 1900, Pellegrini often painted winter scenes, which he also did for his winning work in the 1912 Olympics, after being invited by Pierre, Baron de Coubertin. Pellegrini studied at the Accademia di Belle Arti di Brera in Milano. In 1900, he immigrated to Switzerland. Pellegrini produced numerous postcards and posters on sport and winter landscapes. In addition, he painted landscapes, especially Engadin winter landscapes and portraits. He worked mainly in oil and tempera. In 1917 he returned to his Italian hometown. Prior to his death he donated his gold medal to the local fascist committee. The submitted work was a triptych of three wall friezes. For a long time the complete work was unknown, until 2009 when three chromolithographs were auctioned at Christie’s. The three parts were titled: “Curling - Chess on Ice”, “Ice Dance” and “Winter Begins”. All of them are 23 - 24 cm high, the two outer ones a good 1 m wide, the middle one 60 cm. The identification of the middle piece is especially questionable, since the description published in the Revue Olympique of 1912 mentions ice climbers as well. All lithographs were published by Vouga & Cie. in Geneva. At the auction, together they sold for just under 4,200 British pounds (at the time about 3,730 euros). Whether the original works had the same format as the reproductions is unknown. It is possible that they were destroyed in a major fire at the publishing house together with numerous other originals.",

He was also entered in the 1912 singles at Stockholm, but did not play, which has led to some ongoing confusion which we’ll discuss. Ardelt studied architecture at the Czech Technical University in Praha. He played Davis Cup for Czechoslovakia in 1921-22, appearing in two ties, but losing all five of his matches. Ardelt was author of a popular Czech book on tennis and edited the Czech monthly magazine “Table Tennis and Tennis.” He lived in Černošice, near Praha, where he designed a number of tennis courts and the LTC Praha Letna stadium. In 1964 he received the Czechoslovak Order of Merit for his contribution to the development of physical education and sport in the country. He married Anda Havliček and they had two sons, Robă and Karliček. Another Bohemian tennis player at the 1912 Olympics was Karel Fuchs, later Karel Robětín, occasionally seen as Karel von Robětín. Many sources state that this was one person, who competed in both 1912 and 1920, with different names, but our extensive research on this matter has shown this not to be true. In fact, both were entered in the singles in 1912 at Stockholm, but Karel Ardelt did not play. Further, there are 1912 Olympic entry forms for both players in the Stockholm Riksarchivet. The confusion arises partly because their birthdates are very close – three days apart. Further confirmation that there were two such persons comes from Bohemian family conscription forms, which document the two different families, and some newspaper articles on the 1921 Davis Cup match against Belgium, in which Ardelt played, but the story was sent to the newspapers by Robětín, and it specifically mentions both names. We also know of the wives and descendants of both athletes and they are not the same, and we have spoken to the grandson of Robětín. Sources calling Karel Ardelt and Karel Fuchs-Robětín the same person are in error.",

With a go-for-broke attitude, he became famous in 1948 for a straight schuss down the Inferno on Mt. Lassen. Buek was the first person to schuss the main Soda Springs ski hill at night with only a flashlight to see his way down the slope. Competitively he won US downhill titles in both 1952 and 1954, but it is his extreme sports exploits for which he is best known. In 1953 he was involved in a serious motorcycle crash, breaking his pelvis, leg, and shoulder, but came back to race in 1954 with his right knee still very stiff, winning the US downhill title despite that. He died in an airplane crash over Donner Lake, when the plane he was flying failed to come out of some loops and was flying low over the lake. Buek was also known as the fiancé of Jill Kinmont, the great American skier who was paralyzed in a ski accident, and whose story was told in the movie, “The Other Side of the Mountain.”","Listed in Olympians Who Died in Aviation Crashes (Died in an airplane crash over Donner Lake (USA), when he was towing water skiers over the lake.)"

A classical style specialist, who rarely competed in freestyle, he is considered by experts as one of the strongest classical skiers ever. Veerpalu came into prominence quite late in his career, winning a surprising silver medal in 50 km classical at the 1999 World Championships. At the 2001 World Championships, Veerpalu won the 30 km classical and his most successful tournament was the 2002 Winter Olympics, where he won gold in 15 km classical and silver in 50 km classical. At the 2006 Olympics, Veerpalu repeated his 15 km classical victory and became, as of 2013, the oldest individual Olympic gold medal winner in cross-country skiing at 35 years and 8 days old. Veerpalu’s last major international tournament medal came at the 2009 World Championships, where he won gold in 15 km classical and became, as of 2013, the oldest individual World Champion in cross-country skiing at 38 year and 11 days old. At the 2010 Winter Olympics, where Veerpalu was sixth in the 50 km classical, he became the fourth cross-country skier to compete at six Winter Olympic Games, along with Maarja-Liisa Kirvesniemi, Harri Kirvesniemi and Jochen Behle. At the World Cup, Veerpalu won six races during his career and had another five podium finishes, but never finished very high in overall World Cup standings because he skipped most freestyle races. His highest ranking in overall World Cup was seventh in the 2002-03 and 2003-04 seasons. Domestically, Veerpalu won 24 individual Estonian titles and three relay titles between 1990-11. Veerpalu’s career came to an abrupt end in February 2011, just days before the 2011 World Championships, when he tested positive for HGH (human growth hormone) and received a three-year ban. In March 2013, his ban was lifted by the Court of Arbitration for Sport, when it was proven that the test used by WADA was not reliable to distinguish artificial HGH from natural background hormone and produced numerous false positives. Beginning in the autumn of 2013, Veerpalu worked as a consultant with the Kazakh national cross-country team.",Father of Andreas Veerpalu Listed in Olympians Who Were Awarded the Holmenkollmedaljen (2005) Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the World Nordic Ski Championships (2–1–0 1999 Ramsau CCS silver: 50 km; 2001 Lahti CCS gold: 30 km; 2009 Liberec CCS gold: 15 km)

Baird also studied piano and musicology at the University of Warsaw. Immediately after the war, he began to compose and, together with fellow composers, founded “Grupa 49”, which strove for a socialist-realistic aesthetic. In Poland he was one of the first composers to turn to 12-tone music. In 1956 Baird was one of the initiators of the “Warsaw Autumn”, an international festival of contemporary music. Beginning in 1974 he taught composition at the State Academy of Music, and in 1977 he took over the chair of composition there. He was appointed a member of the Academy of Arts in Berlin (East) and an honorary member of the Polish Composers’ Association. Baird died unexpectedly from a brain aneurysm. Baird used modern compositional forms and combined them with elements of musical tradition. Although called “the last Polish Romantic”, Baird was also considered a successor to Expressionism. In addition to concert works, he composed music for film and television. He was awarded numerous national honors and art prizes. Baird’s Sonatina No. 2 for Piano was written in 1952, and the movements are Vivo e giocoso, Molto andante and Allegro con fuoco. The original title of the work was Concert Sonatina for Piano. The duration was 12-minutes. It earned him the third prize in this category of the pre-Olympic art competitions in Poland.

He attended Green Mountain Valley School in Vermont for his junior and senior years to hone his skills on snow, was a World Junior Champion at age 17, and skied his first World Cup event the next year. After making the US Ski team at age 16, Nobis quit the World Cup circuit in 1996 and skied the pro tour for a bit, dabbled in coaching, and worked in ski shops out west. He then turned to freeriding, however, appearing in multiple ski films for Warren Miller Entertainment, Teton Gravity Research, and Matchstick Productions.

23813,Albertson Van Zo Post,Male,28 July 1866,,, United States,USA,"To Albertson Van Zo Post belongs the distinction of being the first American ever to win an Olympic championship in fencing, an accomplishment not duplicated for over 90 years. This is a credit long denied him because there has been a popular misconception for some years that he was a member of the Cuban team at the 1904 Olympics. In fact, he belonged to an old New York family. His father, Col. Henry V. Post, fought for the Union Army in the Civil War and was wounded seriously at Antietam. Post represented the New York Fencers Club and won the AFLA national championship in foil individual in 1895, épée individual in 1896 and 1912, and sabre individual in 1902 and 1903. He is one of the very few fencers to win the national championship in all three weapons. At the 1904 Olympics, aided by a sparse turnout, Post took a medal in each of the four events he entered, including a gold in single-sticks, an event that was never again contested at the Olympics. Post fenced all three weapons in the 1912 Olympics, and with a larger and stronger field, Post’s second-round elimination in all three weapons is probably a better indicator of his true ability. Albertson Van Zo Post had two careers. Although he trained as a civil engineer and entered that profession, he switched to writing novels, producing “Retz” and “Diana Ardway.”","Listed in Olympic Fencers - Winning Medals, Épée/Sabre, Individual (1904 Épée (Bronze); 1904 Sabre (Bronze).)

74170,Stein Johnson,Male,20 October 1921,,, Norway,NOR,"Born in Bergen with a Norwegian mother and Swedish father, Stein Johnson’s family was very interested sports. Stein’s aunt Sonja took part in swimming at the Olympics in Stockholm in 1912 for Sweden. Stein focused on athletics, and was four times Norwegian champion in the discus in the years just after World War II. He participated in the Summer Games in London in 1948 where he placed eighth, and in Helsinki in 1952, where he failed to qualify for the finals. At the European Athletics Championships he took fifth place in 1946 and fourth in 1950. Having worked as an athletic trainer for some years he was employed as a speed skating coach for the Norwegian national team in the summer of 1962. Norwegian skaters had had a particularly dismal season prior to his arrival, but with his scientific approach to skating training Stein Johnson had immediate success, and was the man behind the so-called Norwegian “skating revolution” in 1963. During the country match against the Soviet at Bislett in January 1963, the Norwegian team was outstanding, and four Norwegians went under Boris Shilkov’s legendary world record for 5,000 metres. The Norwegians took a quadruple victory during the European Championships in Göteburg a week later, with Nils Aaness, Knut Johannesen, Per Ivar Moe and Magne Thomassen at the top of the leaderboard. Suddenly Stein Johnson was the hottest coaching name in Norwegian sports. Stein Johnson coached several different sports, and all with great success. During the Olympics in 1968, he was coach of the Norwegian fours in canoeing, leading them to a gold. Four years later, he was the man behind Knut Knudsen’s sensational gold medal in track cycling at the Summer Games in Munich.

Vlasov was heavily favored to defend his Olympic title in 1964 at Tokyo, but Zhabotynsky defeated him by breaking the world record in the clean & jerk and also claimed the World title. Before the Olympics, Zhabotynsky had always lost to Vlasov in every head-to-head competition, winning bronze at the 1963 World and silver at the 1963 European Championships. Zhabotynsky had also taken three consecutive silver medals at the Soviet championships behind Vlasov, but won the Soviet title in 1964 in Vlasov’s absence. Zhabotynsky followed his 1964 Olympic victory with victories at the World Championships in 1965 and 1966 and then defended his Olympic title in 1968, which also counted as a World title. He also won European Championships in 1966 and 1968, won the Soviet title in 1965 and 1967-69 and the Soviet Cup in 1973. Zhabotynsky, who took up weightlifting in 1956 after being a competent shot putter, was less impressive against the record book than some other super-heavyweight World Champions, but he did post 19 world records one in the press, 16 in the clean & jerk, and two in the total. He had a very long career as a weightlifter as he set his last world record, 185½ kg. in the clean & jerk, on 21 February 1974. Zhabotynsky graduated from the Kharkiv Pedagogical Institute in 1964 and received a candidate of pedagogy degree in 1970. After finishing his sporting career Zhabotynsky worked as a weightlifting coach with the Soviet Army and retired from the force in 1991 as a colonel. From 1987-91 Zhabotynsky worked in Madagascar, being a military consultant to the local government as well as head coach of the Madagascar national weightlifting team. In 1991, after retiring from the Army, Zhabotynsky started to work as a pro-rector of the Moscow Institute of Business and Law, one of the first private higher education facilities in Russia.",

Whilst born in Antwerp he spent some of his schooldays in England at Brighton College and was to later return to play most of his polo in England. His father Ernest had purchased an old racecourse in Antwerp in 1895, and whilst at Brighton Alfred saw the importance of multi-sports clubs and in 1899 convinced his father it would be a good idea to turn it into a multi-sports stadium as it had all the facilities; grandstand, stables, club house and changing rooms, and so was born the Beerschot Football and Athletic club. Grisar’s favourite sport at the time was football, although he was also a good tennis player and golfer, as he played in goal for FC Antwerp but with the formation of the new club they formed their own Beerschot football team and Grisar managed to recruit many of the Antwerp players to join the new club. They entered the Belgian League in 1900-01 and finished runners-up in their first season. They did not win the title for the first time until 1922 but then won it seven times in the next 12 years. Grisar started playing polo in Argentina with the famous Hurlingham Club, who still contest a trophy in his honour. He founded the Antwerp Polo Club (later the Royal Antwerp Polo Club) in 1905 and was home to many top Belgian players between the two World Wars, until its demise in 1940. It was in England that Grisar earned a reputation as a top player, and he played for Eastcott, Roehampton, the Automobile Club and his own Brussels-based Pilgrims team. He won the 1924 Coronation Cup at Ranelagh with Eastcott, and twice won the Roehampton Trophy with the Pilgrims, in 1913 and 1929. He continued playing with the Pilgrims well into his fifties. A registered left-handed player, he had a 6-goal handicap and was a member of the Belgian team at the 1920 Olympics on home soil. He played in the 8-3 defeat by Great Britain and also in the bronze medal match in which they lost heavily again, 11-3 to the United States. But that wasn’t the end of his involvement in the 1920 Olympics because he was the umpire of the final between Great Britain and Spain. Grisar’s cousin Albert won a bronze medal in the sailing events at the same Games. Four years later Alfred was the President of the executive committee for the Polo competition at the 1924 Paris Olympics, and was the only non-British member of the committee.","Cousin of Robert Grisar Cousin of Albert Grisar Listed in Olympians Who Participated in the Grand National Steeplechase as a Jockey, Trainer or Horse Owner (Co-owner of Koko, who ran in 1928)"

921342,Carl Fagerberg,Male,3 November 1878,,, Sweden,SWE,"Swedish sculptor Carl Fagerberg won Honorable Mention for his sculpture Skater at the 1932 Olympics in the category Mixed Sculpturing and Statues. After completing a carpenter’s apprenticeship, he was a student of the Technical University and the Stockholm Art Academy. In 1906, he went to France, Germany, Russia, Italy, Spain, and Tunis, supported by a Jenny Lind Scholarship. In 1908, Fagerberg set up a studio in Stockholm but spent most of his life in Sundbyberg. He was known for his animal sculptures, but also worked as a painter, and created several important works of religious art. As a sculptor, Fagerberg mainly worked with granite, bronze and porcelain, and also designed medallions and medals. The Russian tsar commissioned him with the stucco for the St. Petersburg train station in 1907. Since 1937 two of Fagerberg’s sculptures (Shot putter and Relay Runners) can be found around the Stockholm Olympic Stadium. He received the order for these life-size sculptures in 1931. However, there was also public opposition to his sculptures at the time. A third commissioned sculpture, the Javelin thrower, was eventually placed elsewhere. The Orienteer could not be identified. It is interesting in this context that Fagerberg took part in the first orienteering races in Sweden as a youth. His Skater (Skridskoåkaren) is featured in the 1932 art catalog. The bronze sculpture is 50 cm high and 60 cm long and is dated “April 1932”. His model was the Norwegian speed skater Ivar Ballangrud.",

He won three consecutive European titles at 200 breaststroke between 1989 and 1993 and won the World Championship in the same event in 1993. He took a further two bronze medals from World Championships and another silver and two bronze at European level. Gillingham’s times improved during the early part of 1988 and he arrived at the Seoul Olympics ranked in the world’s top three. In the 200 breaststroke final in Seoul he trailed in the early stages but finished strongly to finish second behind Hungary’s József Szabó. Four years later in Barcelona he swam a personal best time but could only finish third as Mike Barrowman swam to a brilliant new world record. Gillingham himself had set a world record in 1989 and was world ranked #1 for five of the six years between 1989 and 1994. His final Olympic appearance came in 1996 and he again reached the final of the 200 breast where he finished in fourth place. When Andrey Korneyev delivered a positive dope test he was briefly elevated to the bronze medal position but a successful appeal by Korneyev, based on the fact that the drug involved was not specifically named on the list of banned substances, relegated him back to his original position. Gillingham, who also won a gold, a silver and four bronze medals at the Commonwealth Games between 1986 and 1994, retired from competition after Atlanta although he returned to compete with great success in masters events in the 21st century. He has had a wide and varied career which has taken in time as a television commentator, an official with both the British Olympic Association and the Amateur Swimming Association as well as periods in marketing and as a motivational speaker.","Listed in Olympians Who Set a European Record in Long Course Swimming (200 m breaststroke – 18 August 1989 - 20 July 1990 and 23 May 1992 - 29 July 1992: 2:12.90 (18 August 1989; Bonn, GER), 2:11.98 (23 May 1992; Sheffield, GBR), 2:11.62 (23 May 1992; Sheffield, GBR)) Listed in Olympians Who Set a European Record in Short Course Swimming (200 m breaststroke – 11 February 1989 - 24 January 1991 and 27 January 1991 - 28 March 1998: 2:10.79 (11 February 1989; Bonn, FRG), 2:09.81 (11 February 1989; Bonn, FRG), 2:09.49 (29 November 1989; Montréal, CAN), 2:08.15 (27 January 1991; Leicester, GBR), 2:07.93 (20 October 1991; Birmingham, GBR), 2:07.91 (4 December 1993; Palma de Mallorca, ESP)) Listed in Olympians Who Set a World Record in Long Course Swimming (200 m breaststroke – 19 August 1989 - 20 August 1989: 2:12.90 tied (19 August 1989; Bonn, FRG)) Listed in Olympians Who Set a World Record in Short Course Swimming (200 m breaststroke – 20 October 1991 - 28 August 1993: 2:07.93 (20 October 1991; Birmingham, GBR)) Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the European Aquatics Championships (3–1–2 1989 Bonn SWM gold: 200 m breaststroke, bronze: 100 m breaststroke; 1991 Athina SWM gold: 200 m breaststroke; 1993 Sheffield SWM gold: 200 m breaststroke, silver: 100 m breaststroke, bronze: 4×100 m medley relay) Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the World Aquatics Championships (0–0–1 1991 Perth SWI bronze: 200 m breaststroke) Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the World Short-Course Swimming Championships (25 m) (1–0–1 1993 Palma de Mallorca gold: 200 m breaststroke, bronze: 4×100 m medley relay) Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the British Empire/Commonwealth Games (1–2–4 1986 Edinburgh SWI silver: 4×100 m medley (swam in heats only), bronze: 200 m breaststroke (competed for England); 1990 Auckland SWI bronze: 100 m breaststroke and 200 m breaststroke (competed for England); 1994 Victoria SWI gold: 200 m breaststroke, silver: 100 m breaststroke, bronze: 4×100 m medley (competed for England))"

He lived in Berlin beginning in 1913 and taught at the College of Art Education, starting in 1925. In 1915, he became a member of the Berlin Secession. During World War I, he was deployed as a map draftsman on the Eastern Front. After the war, he became a member of the Prussian Academy of Arts. During his stay in the Allgäu region, he then created religious and mystical pictures. Back in Berlin, Jaeckel painted landscapes, nudes, and still lifes. He stayed for long periods in the seaside resort Hiddensee. After 1933 his works were removed from museums and exhibitions, and some of them were later included in the traveling exhibition “Degenerate Art”. In 1943 an air raid destroyed his atelier in Berlin, while in 1944 his apartment on the Kurfürstendamm in Berlin burned, and he was buried in the debris and did not survive. The painting Boxing Match is shown in the exhibition catalog of German entries and thus clearly identified. The painting is also reproduced in the 1930 issue of Jugend magazine. Since boxing matches were among Jaeckel’s favorite motifs in this decade, it is unclear which pastel painting is the second work submitted in 1928. Candidates are from the 1920s (landscape format, now lost) and one in 1927 (portrait format, now in private possession). A picture is also available of his 1932 entry, the Skiläufer (Skier).",Listed in Olympians Who Were Killed or Missing in Action or Died as a Result of War (Died under the debris of the bomb shelter of his burned down apartment in Berlin.)

Their daughter, Nancy (1909-88), went on to become a noted writer and editor. The couple was married by Hale’s famous father, the Reverend Edward Everett Hale (1822-1909), who was known as an author, historian, and minister, and belonged to one of Boston’s most distinguished families. His sister Ellen Day Hale (1855-1940) also became a well-known impressionist painter. Philip Hale studied at the School of Boston’s Museum of Fine Arts, in New York and later for five years (1887-92) in Paris. There he made friends with Claude Monet and traveled through Europe. He began painting and drawing as a child and later produced drawings in silver-point, sanguine, and pastel, all of which contributed to his reputation as the “Boston Ingres.” From 1893 he also worked as an influential teacher of painting and art history and a guest teacher at Boston University and the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Before World War I, Hale worked increasingly as an art critic and author. After his early portraits of women, he painted sports and garden scenes under the influence of his French contemporaries.

Previously this move, which entails the man pivoting with one toe on the ice while the woman circles him with her body almost parallel to the ice, had been performed professionally with two hands, and thus the female was not lowered entirely to the ice. The previous year she and Diestelmeyer had been the North American pairs champions and together they spent two years (1947-1948) as Canadian champions in the event, and had claimed a bronze medal at the World Championships in the pairs event earlier that year. Morrow also had a successful career in the singles category and was Canadian champion for three consecutive years from 1949 through 1951. At the World Championships, however, she went from 13th (1948) to 4th (1950-1952), then back down to 5th (1953). She competed in this event twice at the Winter Olympics, placing 14th in 1948 and 6th in 1952. After her retirement, she worked as a figure skating judge for more than fifty years, including at World Championship and Olympic events. At the 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary, she became the first woman to take the Olympic judge’s oath. She obtained a degree in veterinary medicine in 1952 and worked as a veterinarian until 1995, as well as a dog show judge with the Canadian Kennel Club. She, along with partner Diestelmeyer, was made a member of the Skate Canada Hall of Fame in 1992.",Recited the Officials' Oath at the Opening Ceremony of the 1988 Winter Olympics Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the World Figure Skating Championships (0–0–1 1948 Davos bronze: pairs)

Nogler was an early hero of Italian Alpine skiing, winning several national titles, in Italy, Austria, and Germany. His greatest win might have come at the 1951 Harriman Cup in the United States, when he defeated Italy’s Zeno Colò to win the combined title. Nogler started competing at the national level in Italy in 1937 and later had to struggle with Fascist forced Italicization in the South Tyrol. For a time his family was required to change their name, and he took the name Hans Nano. For many years, it was not known that Hans Nogler and Hans Nano were the same athlete in skiing results. During World War II he was forced to move north to Innsbruck and he fought with the German Army, being wounded on the Russian Front. After World War II, and his victory at the Harriman Cup, Nogler settled in Sun Valley, Idaho, where he worked as a skiing instructor.

During the World War II, Weedon was a dispatch rider for air raid precautions, before joining the Bedfordshire and Hertfordshire Regiment until 1942, when he was discharged after contracting the tuberculosis that cost him a kidney. A physical education teacher at various schools in the Harrow area, Weedon produced many championship-winning school teams, including the national under-11s winners. He was also a coach to many youngsters in the Richmond area, and also coached his future wife Joan Airey, a fellow 1948 Olympian. After deciding he was not fit enough to compete as an athlete, George took up ballroom dancing and competed at the World Championships in Japan when in his 60s. He was also one of the torch bearers for the 2012 London Olympics, having first being refused the honour.

71405,Norman Pritchard,Male,23 June 1875,,, India,IND,"Norman Pritchard is a “controversial” Olympian in that he is claimed by both Britain and India as having competed for them at the 1900 Olympics. The doyen of British Olympic historians, Ian Buchanan, notes that Pritchard was a member of an old colonial family and, although he was born in India, he was undisputedly British. The Indian Olympic historian, Gulu Ezekiel, claims Pritchard based on his birth and the fact that he lived in India for many years. Pritchard moved to England in the summer of 1900 and was elected a member of London AC in June, after which he competed in the AAA Championships, which he entered as a member of the London AC and the Bengal Presidency AC, further adding to the confusion. The British team was chosen for the 1900 Olympics based on the results of the 1900 AAA Championships, and Pritchard’s runner-up finish to Al Kraenzlein in the 120y hurdles garnered him Olympic selection. Buchanan notes that the Paris program lists him as a member of the AAA team, and that The New York Times referred to him as an “Englishman”, yet other starting lists give him as competing for “British India”. Although not a match for the best athletes at the 1900 Olympics, Pritchard was a solid sprinter and hurdler, winning the Bengal 100 yards title for seven consecutive years (1894-1900), and was also Bengal champion at 440 yards and 120y hurdles, which would lend support to the Indian claim. He was also at one time Secretary of the Indian FA. He later moved to the United States, where he took the name Norman Trevor, and became a silent movie star, appearing alongside Ronald Coleman in 27 movies for MGM.

Metcalfe was at his best between the 1932 and 1936 Olympics and he won both sprints at the AAU and NCAA for three straight years (1932-34) and won the AAU 200m in 1935-36 to give him a record of five straight wins in this event. Metcalfe, who attended Marquette, equalled the world record of 10.3 for 100m six times, but only three of those clockings reached the record books. In 1932 he ran a wind-assisted 19.8 for 220y on a straight track in Toronto to become the first man to break the 20-second barrier. In the 1932 Olympic 200m, Metcalfe may have been unfairly deprived of a gold medal when it was later shown that the lane in which he ran was about two meters longer than it should have been. Metcalfe graciously declined a protest and a re-run because the American threesome of Eddie Tolan, George Simpson, and himself had swept the medals in the event. Ralph Metcalfe later became well known in Chicago politics, serving on the city council under Mayor Daley for many years.

He had not originally been selected for the Canadian team, but his friends had organized a petition and collected sufficient funds for him to travel with to London. At the games he presented himself as an independent runner from Quebec, although he was affiliated with the Zouave Amateur Athletic Association at the time. Only a few months later, however, he was kicked out of his athletic club and his position as coach for a strange scandal involving his Olympic teammate Fred Meadows of Ontario. In late October 1908 a runner by the name of “Walter Beland” won Quebec’s annual Telegraph Road Race. Prior to the race, however, the organizers, having never heard of Walter, had become suspicious and began to investigate. It was soon discovered that “Walter Beland” was actually Fred Meadows, and that Dave Beland had altered documents to allow Meadows to compete as if he were from the province, so that he would be eligible to run in the Quebec City versus Montreal competition. Dave knew that Meadows, a former five-mile champion, would be able to give Quebec City the upper hand. To add credibility to the scheme, Dave also claimed that Meadows, who was now in the guise of “Walter Beland”, was his brother. Both Meadows and Beland lost their amateur standing as a result of the scandal, in Beland’s case for having organized the scam. Personal Best: 100 – unknown.",

He started racing 12-foot dinghies at Sidmouth in the late 1950s and went on to become one of the leading national competitors in this class. Over the years he owned some well-known 12’s, including Lucky Number, with whom he won the National 12-foot Championship for the Burton Cup, with crewman Derek Sinden. Pym’s natural progression was up to the Finn Class and he set his sights on the 1968 Olympics after rising through the world rankings. Despite taking part in the pre-Olympic Regatta at Acapulco in 1967, and faring well in the Olympic Selection races at Poole, Pym was only a reserve for the Games. He did, however, travel to Mexico and helped Michael Maynard with his training. Pym was selected for the Olympics four years later after trouncing the favourite, and 1968 Olympic Flying Dutchman gold medallist, Iain Macdonald-Smith in the trials at Torbay. At the Games, however, Pym finished 18th out of 35 starters and was disqualified in race five after facing two protests. He was no stranger to controversy over the years, and in one incident, when a Continental opponent barged him at the start-line of a race, he hit his opponent with an oar and subsequently earned the nickname “Pym the Paddle.” Pym’s was a co-founder of Needlespars with Flying Dutchman world champion David Hunt. The company developed the technology for aluminium Finn masts and these became standard within the sport until replaced by carbon fibre masts some years later. Needlespars were the official suppliers of aluminium masts to the 1972 Olympics. After Finns, Pym moved up to offshore racing with quarter- and then half-tonners, and also J24’s. After his retirement, Pym joined the Royal Ocean Racing Club Rating Office Measurement Team in 1992.",

97652,Hooley Smith,Male,7 January 1905,178.0,70, Canada,CAN,"Right winger and “hockey genius” Reginald “Hooley” Smith began his career on the ice inconspicuously, as a member of the junior-level Parkdale Canoe Club of the Ontario Hockey League in 1920. Within a year, however, he was a member of the Toronto Granites and, in his first two seasons, he won two Allan Cups, given annually to the senior men’s ice hockey champions in Canada. Next on the docket was the 1924 Winter Olympics and, as a representative of Canada, he played in five games, scored 18 goals, and helped Canada take home the gold medal at the hockey tournament. After being drafted in 1924 by the National Hockey League’s Ottawa Senators, he gained a reputation as an amazingly talented player, being highly skilled in both his offensive and defensive capabilities. He was also known, however, for his cocky attitude and short temper. During the 1927 Stanley Cup finals, he attacked Boston Bruins forward Harry Oliver and a bloody battle ensued. His team won the match and the cup, but Frank Calder, then president of the NHL, suspended Smith for a month at the beginning of the next season. In need of cash, the Senators sold Smith to the Montreal Maroons, with whom he would play for the next seasons. The total cost of the trade was $22,500, at the time a record sum. Along with Nels Stewart and Babe Siebert he was part of the “S line”, a fearsome forward line that was notorious throughout the NHL for its ruthless effectiveness until 1932. It wasn’t until 1935, however, that his name would be engraved on another Stanley Cup. A year later it was the Maroons who were struggling to survive financially so they sold Smith, by then captain of the team, to the Boston Bruins where he played for one season before being traded again, this time to the New York Americans. He played with them for four seasons, still a first-rate player, but his temper and fights with coach Red Dutton got him suspended for insubordination in 1941 and Smith decided to finally hang up his skates, having just breeched the 200 goal mark. He died in 1963, the last surviving member of the S line, and was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1972.","Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the World Ice Hockey Championships (1–0–0 1924 Chamonix (Olympics) gold) Listed in Olympic Champions Who Have Played in a Stanley Cup Winning Team (Olympic Gold – 1924; Stanley Cup Champion – 1927 Ottawa Senators, 1935 Montréal Maroons.)

Excelling in several strokes, she specialized in the IMs. At the 1984 Olympics, a great battle was originally expected between Caulkins and the East German Petra Schneider but it did not materialize due to the Soviet-led boycott. Caulkins easily won both individual medley races, and added a third Olympic gold in the medley relay, swimming breaststroke.

In addition to winning the discus at the 1904, 1906 and 1908 Olympic Games, Sheridan won the shot in 1906 and the Greek-style discus in 1908. To these five gold medals he added three silver medals in 1906 in the stone throw and the standing jumps and a bronze medal in the standing long jump in 1908. Inspired by his older brother, Richard, who won the AAU discus in 1901 and 1902, Martin himself won the title four times. He also won the AAU shot in 1904 and three times was the AAU All-Around champion, setting a new world record each time. Further proof of his versatility came at the 1908 Olympics when he placed ninth in the triple jump, and was also the non-pulling captain of the United States tug-of-war team against Liverpool Police. Sheridan’s first cousin Jim Clarke was in the British team. The discus was undoubtedly Sheridan’s best event; in addition to his three Olympic titles and four AAU championships, he improved the world best in the discus 15 times between 1902 and 1909. Sheridan almost certainly missed another gold medal when he was forced to withdraw from the 1906 pentathlon due to injury. Apart from his prowess as a competitor, Martin Sheridan has passed into Olympic lore with his remark to the press at the 1908 Olympics, where he was quoted as saying, “This flag dips to no earthly King!” after the Michigan weightman, Ralph Rose, refused to lower the American flag as he passed the Royal Box at the Opening Ceremony. Like many of the great Irish-American athletes of the time, Sheridan was employed by the New York Police Department (NYPD) and was the personal bodyguard of the New York governor whenever he visited the city. Sheridan, who had come to America in 1897, retired from active competition in 1911 and died of pneumonia at the early age of 36. In his honor, the NYPD began the Martin Sheridan Medal for Valor award, given to policeman (from 1921-73) exhibiting significant valor in action.

He continued training in his free time and, despite having to give up a month’s worth of pay to participate, attended the trials for the 1932 Summer Games, where he was successful in his attempt to make the Canadian team. At the Olympics he won a bronze medal in the 4x400 metre relay (alongside Jimmy Ball, Phil Edwards, and Alex Wilson) and was eliminated in the quarterfinals of the 400 metres.

Lewis retired from active competition after failing to qualify for the 1936 Summer Olympics and, after struggling against the climate of racism that pervaded the era, was able to leave portering and start up a cleaning business in 1952. In 1968 he became a chauffeur for George Kerr, a Canadian cabinet minister, and ended his career in 1988 as a court clerk in Hamilton, Ontario.

He played for Redruth for 13 years, apart from a brief spell when he went to work in the South African goldfields in 1902 and had the honour of captaining Transvaal in the Currie Cup. He returned to Redruth in 1907 and fly-half Davey had a memorable year in 1908 when, firstly, he made his international début for England against Scotland at Inverleith. He then won the County Championship as Cornwall won the title for the first time beating Durham 17-3 at Redruth with Davey scoring one of their five tries. It would be 83 years before Cornwall next won the title. Davey was then selected for the Anglo-Welsh (British Lions) tour to New Zealand and Australia and scored 15 points in 13 matches and played in the first Test at Dunedin. He returned from “down-under” to represent Cornwall in the Paris Olympics where they won the silver medal after losing 32-3 to Australia in the only game of the tournament. Davey went on to win his third and final international cap, for England, against Wales at Cardiff in January 1909. Davey had a spell playing for Coventry in 1908-09 and both club and player were suspended by the Rugby Football Union (RFU) for breach of the amateur rules when the club allegedly paid Davey’s hotel accommodation when he stayed overnight in Coventry.",

111111,Peter Crinnion,Male,12 February 1939,177.0,75, Ireland,IRL,"Peter Crinnion’s cycling career flourished in the early part of 1960 when the County Wicklow born rider won three of Ireland’s four domestic qualifying events and the national championships road race to cement his place on his country’s first Olympic cycling team since 1928. He made a good start to the road race and was riding in the main peloton when he was brought down by other riders crashing in front on him. Crinnion chased down the pack but paid for his efforts and was subsequently dropped. The 1960 road race is famous for its vagueness and inaccuracy in the results and, while Irish Olympic Committee sources list him as an implausible 45th of 50 finishers, the Official Rresults list him as a non-finisher. A photograph taken from the stands show him crossing the line alone but with his path blocked by preparations for the medal ceremony. In 1961 he joined the French Margnat-Rochet-Dunlop team and made his débuts in such races as Milan-San Remo and Paris-Nice as a support rider to the team’s better-known riders. His performances earned him a move to the Urago-Pestrina team and it was there that he had his best season in 1962. Crinnion became the first non-Frenchman to win the Route de France (the amateur version of the Tour de France), finished second in the Grand Prix de France time-trial and strengthened the Great Britain team at the Tour de l’Avenir. A largely forgettable 1963 saw him return to the Margnat team as a domestique to Tour de France winner Federico Bahamontes and a prospective second season with the team was ruled out by a change in regulations that limited the numbers of foreigners who could be registered with a French team. At the end of the year he received an offer to join Raymond Poulidor at the prestigious Mercier-BP-Hutchinson team but he had already agreed to join the Belgian Lamont-Libertas outfit. When Lamont-Libertas collapsed in mid- season after the team manager embezzled their funds, Crinnion’s career as a top-class professional was effectively over. He rode for two more seasons, and then retired and moved back to Ireland. Crinnion turned to coaching and administration, which culminated in him being Ireland’s cycling team manager at the 1980 Olympics in Moskva. Amongst the riders on the Irish team was future Tour de France winner Stephen Roche and Crinnion acted as a mentor and personal coach to the Dubliner and helped him negotiate his first professional contract.",
