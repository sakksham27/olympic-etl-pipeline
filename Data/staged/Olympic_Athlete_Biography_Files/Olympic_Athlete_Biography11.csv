She first appeared at the Winter Olympics in 1994, taking seventh in the 500m event, sixth in the 1,000m competition, and a silver medal in the 3,000m relay. The following year she began a run as Canadian champion that would last until 1999, and was named the Canadian Female Athlete of the Year by Speed Skating Canada, but it was in 1996 that she truly made history in the sport. Not only did she place third overall in that year’s World Championships, with gold and silver in the 500m and 1,000m events respectively, but she set a new world record in the former competition that she would hold as long as she was Canadian champion. She soon broke her own record, however, and became the first woman to skate the 500m in under 45 seconds, officially with a time of 44.86 seconds in March 1997, and unofficially (although it was counted as a Canadian record) three months prior with a time of 44.77 seconds. With this title to her name, it was no surprise that she was once again named Canadian Female Athlete of the Year that season, and her success followed her to the 1998 Winter Olympics, where she took home 3,000m relay bronze. She had the fasted 500m time during this tournament, but fell during the final and ended up in seventh place, the same ranking she received in the 1,000m event. Charest then decided to take a break from competition to focus on obtaining her Bachelor’s in nutrition from the University of Montreal. By the end of the year, however, she was back on the ice and trying her hand at the long track. By mid-1999 she had switched to short track once more and was preparing for her next Winter Games. Although she took another leave during 2001, she captured another bronze medal at the 2002 Winter Olympics in the 3,000m relay, as well as placing fourth in the 500m event, prior to retiring.

In his final year he was awarded the Biggs Trophy for “outstanding Leadership, Sportsmanship and Performance.” In 1946 Halder rejected an offer to join the New York Rangers because he wanted a no-trade contract and instead joined the Toronto Barkers of the TOHL, where he was playing when the offer came in for him to join the RCAF Flyers, Canada’s ice hockey delegation to the 1948 Winter Olympics. He had drawn attention after being named the Toronto Hockey League’s MVP in 1947.

He was involved in an incident involving a Swedish competitor, who accidentally fired his rifle while turning away from the target. It narrowly missed Willoughby, but hit a Swiss policeman. Willoughby missed his next three shots and, as a result, was last of the 11 finishers. After his Army career, Willoughby was a ski correspondent for the Daily Mail. He also imported ski equipment, and was a coach to the Ski Federation of Great Britain for a while. Willoughby carved out another career for himself in 1983, when he had his own 30-minute TV show on BBC television called, simply, Willoughby.

Oxford were again successful in 1913 with Horsfall as stroke but in 1914, when Horsfall rowed at number four, Cambridge enjoyed a comfortable victory. He also rowed number four in the Leander eight that won the gold medals at the 1912 Olympics when, at the age of 20, he was the youngest member of the crew. Ewart Horsfall will go down in history as one of the great strokes of English rowing. In 1913 he became the first stroke to win the Boat Race after being behind at Barnes Bridge. He won the Grand four times – three times as a stroke – and he stroked the winning crew in the Stewards’ on the only two occasions he competed. At the outbreak of war, Horsfall initially joined the Rifle Brigade but later transferred to the RAF, attaining the rank of squadron leader and achieving the distinction of being awarded the rare “double” of a Military Cross (1916) and a Distinguished Flying Cross (1918). After the war, he was invited back to Oxford to help re-establish rowing at the University, a task which enabled him to keep in training and, in 1920, make a second Olympic appearance, stroking the Leander eight that came within half a length of winning their successive Olympic title. Horsfall always maintained his interest in the sport and in 1948 he was manger of the British Olympic rowing team.","Listed in Olympians Who Competed in the Boat Race (1912 Oxford (won), 1913 Oxford (won), 1914 Oxford (lost))"

After the war he exiled himself to his villa in Capri and did not attend horse shows even as a spectator. Alvisa wrote the book Gli Aforismi e i Paradossi Equestri (Aphorisms and Paradoxes about Riding), which was a fun and lively series of observations on horse riding, which contained an introduction by Gabriele D’Annunzio.","Listed in Olympic Equestrian Riders - Winning Medals in Jumping and 3-Day Event (1920 Jumping, Team (Bronze); 1924 3-Day Event, Team (Bronze).)"

16334,Brian Robinson,Male,3 November 1930,,, Great Britain,GBR,"Yorkshireman Brian Robinson holds a special place in the history of British cycling as the first Briton to complete the Tour de France and also the first to win a stage. He was a pioneering British cyclist on the continent, and was the inspiration to many like Tom Simpson (who once shared a Paris flat with Robinson), and many of the modern-day professionals. Robinson only started racing on the continent after his brother Desmond attended a training camp in France in the early 1950s, and suggested Brian join him. Robinson started cycling seriously as a 13-year-old with the Huddersfield Road Club, of which he remained a member for over 70 years, but his father would not let him take part in competitive events until he was 18. He started his working life in his father’s building business but, once he took up competitive cycling, soon started showing potential in the early 1950s in Time Trial and Hill Climbing events. Robinson did his National Service between 1951-53 but continued with his cycling career and was a member of the Army Cycling Team. In 1954 he joined the Ellis-Brigg professional team. The Robinson siblings were in the Great Britain road race squad at the 1952 Helsinki Olympics, with Brian finishing 27th, one place behind Desmond, despite having the same time. In 1954 Robinson finished second to Frenchman Eugène Tambourlini in the Tour of Britain (later the Milk Race) and the following year made his début in the Tour de France when he was part of the first British team to take part in the race. Robinson competed in the tour on seven occasions between 1955-61 and finished on five occasions, with a best overall finish of 14th in 1956. He also took part in the Vuelta a España twice, and was eighth overall in 1956. When he won the seventh stage from Saint-Brieuc to Brest in the 1958 Tour he made history as the first British winner of a stage. Despite finishing second to Italy’s Arrigo Padovan, Robinson appealed against the Italian’s bumping in the sprint, and it was upheld by the judges. The following year, Robinson won his second stage, from Annecy to Chalon-sur-Saône, by 20 minutes from the peloton, headed by – Padovan. In 1957 Robinson started the season in style by winning the 188km (117 miles) Grand Prix of Nice by 50 seconds from three-time Tour de France winner Louison Bobet. Robinson then finished third in the season’s opening Classic, the Milano-Sanremo to become he first Briton to stand on the podium of this great race. He had to wait until 1961, however, for his first professional major stage race win, when he took the Critérium du Dauphiné Libéré. Robinson retired from racing at the end of the 1962 season and returned to England to start his own building business. Fifty-three years after last racing in the Tour de France, Robinson was involved with the race again in 2014 when it started in Yorkshire. Robinson was an ambassador for the Grand Départ of the race and, along with former professional and fellow Yorkshireman Barry Hoban, they played a key role in getting Yorkshire to be part of the race. Robinson was inducted into the British Cycling Hall of Fame in 2009 and in the 2017 New Year’s Honours list was awarded the British Empire Medal for his services to cycling.",Brother of Desmond Robinson Father of Louise Robinson

For years, he played ice hockey during the winter and tennis in the summer, but his hockey career was cut short in 1949. During a tennis tournament in Gstaad, Switzerland, he defected from communist Czechoslovakia with a fellow Davis Cup player, Vladimír Černík. Drobný, who had won the 1947 World Championships with Czechoslovakia, could no longer represent his country on the ice. As an Egyptian citizen, he won Grand Slam singles titles at Roland Garros (1951, 1952) and Wimbledon (1954). His 1954 Wimbledon championship made him the first left-hander to win that title since Norman Brookes in 1914. He was also a five-time runner-up in Grand Slam events; three times at Roland Garros (1946, 1948, 1950), and twice at Wimbledon (1949, 1952). His ice hockey legacy could still be found in his dark prescription glasses, which he needed following a hockey accident that severely affected his eyesight. Drobný uniquely competed at Wimbledon for four different “nations.” He first played there in 1938, representing Czechoslovakia, and again under that designation in 1946-49. In 1939, following political upheaval in Europe, he was listed from the Nazi-occupied protectorate of Bohemia-Moravia.

They together also won eight World titles (in 1989-90 in C-2 500, in 1989-91 in C-4 500 and 1989-91 in C4 1,000), two World Championships silvers (in 1991 and 1995 in C-2 500) and one bronze (in 1991 in C-2 1,000). Despite those successes, the pair was not selected for the 1992 Olympics by the Unified Team. Instead, Juravschi was invited to the Romanian 1992 Olympic team, and with new partner Gheorghe Andriev reached the finals of both the C-2 500 and C-2 1,000, finishing in the unfortunate fourth position in both races. After the 1992 Olympics and the fall of Soviet Union, the pair fell apart, as Juravschi started to represent his native Moldova and Reneischi returned to his native Belarus. They were not very successful after separating, so in 1995, Juravschi persuaded his former partner to join up again and represent his home country Moldova. Their comeback was successful, as they won silver in the C-2 500 metres at the 1995 World Championships and repeated that feat at the 1996 Olympics, where they won the first ever Olympic medal for the newly independent Moldova.

63333,Luigi Mino Poggi,Male,11 March 1906,,, Italy,ITA,"Luigi Mino Poggi was an Italian sailor. He was one of the six members of the Italian boat, Italia, which won the first Olympic gold medal in the history of Italian sailing in Kiel in 1936 and the 53rd overall for Italy. The boat, built at the Attilio Costaguta shipyard in Genova Voltri, was launched on 20 June 1936, just under two months before the Games, and transported by train to Germany. In the Kiel fjord on the Baltic Sea it immediately proved to be a yacht with excellent performance, especially with medium-strong winds. There was great indecision for the final result since, in the fifth race, there were a series of protests from the crews of other vessels. During this day there were many collisions between close hulls but the regattas continued in the following days without a jury verdict. This issue was resolved at the end of all of the races. Thanks to the filming from above by German director Leni Riefenstahl, in an airship struggling with the official film of the Olympic Games, the jury could better ascertain the responsibility of that event and decreed that the collision of Italia with the Norwegian boat had been inevitable because it had been provoked by the Danish boat Anitra. In not being given the penalty, the Italian boat managed to clinch victory. The win at the Berlin Olympics remains unique, because it was won by an Italian crew with a boat designed and built in Italy. Italia can still be admired sailing in the waters of the Gulf of Napoli and is moored in Molosiglio in the nautical base of the Naval League and has been recognized by the Ministry of Cultural Heritage as a “historical asset”. In memory of Poggi, a member of the Italian Yacht Club, the Poggi Cup is organized every year in Genova, reserved for the 420, 470 and Laser classes.",Brother of Enrico Poggi

She was a regular medallist in major championships in the period between Olympics and won silver medals at both the 1997 and 1999 World Championships.

She took the lead after the sixth event, the javelin, and held on to become the first British female multi-event champion since Mary Peters in 1972.

His record in Army polo was even more noteworthy; he maintained a ten goal handicap for many years, was a member of the team which won the inter-regimental tournament in India in 1913 and 1914, and, when polo re-started in England after the war, played on the winning team in the inter-regimental championship every year from 1920 to 1930, with the exception of 1927. On leaving Sandhurst, Lockett initially joined the Royal Field Artillery before transferring to the 17th Lancers. After the regiment had become the 17/21 Lancers he succeeded to his fellow Old Wellingtonian and Olympic gold medallist, Tim Melville , as Commanding Officer in 1927. Colonial Lockett retired from the Army in 1933 but was recalled in 1940 and commanded the Cavalry Training Centre in Edinburgh.

A talented sprinter, Westergren also was a skater, tennis player, and sailor, and competed in both the long jump and high jump. At the end of the 19th century Westergren twice equalled the world-best time for the 100 metres, running 10.8 seconds in September 1898 and again in September 1899. The times remained unofficial as the International Amateur Athletics Federation (IAAF) did not ratify times until 1912. Westergren was the Swedish national champion in the 100 metres in 1899 and won bronze in the 4x100 metres relay in 1902. At the 1900 Paris Olympics he ran in the 60 metres, 100 metres, and the 100 metres with a handicap. Westergren’s best performance in Paris came in the latter event, reaching the semi-finals, but he did have a walkover in his heat. With an early interest in sporting innovations Westergren helped to bring some of them into common use in Sweden, including the use of spiked running shoes and starting blocks. He helped to found the Kamraten Sports Association, serving as their chair from 1901 to 1902, before co-founding the Gästrikland Sports Association in 1907. Westergren was involved in the foundation of the National Sports Association, where he sat on its board from 1903 to 1913 and again from 1917 to 1923. During the 1920s he was also a member of the Swedish Olympic Committee, the Swedish Sports Association, and Sweden’s sports venue committee. Ahead of the 1920 Antwerpen Olympics Westergren contributed a large sum of money from his own pocket to allow Sweden to send their best team to the Olympics. Under his leadership he led the reconstruction of the Strömvallen sports arena in Gävle from 1920 to 1923.

His professional career was even shorter at 11 months, although he did win all five of his contests. An ABA semi-finalist in 1970, Taylor’s finest moment as an amateur was in reaching the bantamweight final the following year, when he lost on points to Liverpool’s George Turpin. Many times an England international, Taylor was selected for the 1972 München Olympics at the expense of Scotland’s Vernon Sollas who was dropped from the squad after being convicted of stealing at an Edinburgh court shortly before the Games. Taylor turned professional in 1973 and his penultimate fight as an amateur was against the future WBA lightweight champion Arturo Frias in New York. Despite losing to Frias, Taylor was part of the England team that enjoyed a memorable 6-5 win over their American counterparts. After learning his boxing skills at the St. Monica’s and Colverston boxing clubs, Taylor joined the famous Repton Boxing Club in the mid-1960s that would become a breeding ground for many well-known Olympians such as Audley Harrison, Maurice Hope, and John H. Stracey. The infamous Kray twins, Reggie and Ronnie, also boxed at the club in the 1950s. Taylor retired from the ring in 1974 and turned to coaching at Repton, where he helped develop the skills of many young boxers who became junior champions.

Henry Stewart served during World War II as captain with the Royal Scots Greys and returned to England after the conflict, where he earned a degree in art history and chemistry from the University of Manchester. Returning to Canada, he represented that country in equestrian at the 1952 Summer Olympics, finishing 22nd among 59 competitors in the individual three-day event and also competing in the team version alongside Larry McGuinness and Tom Gayford. Before and after his Olympic experience, Treviranus continued studying and working as a painting conservator in Canada and the United States. He eventually settled permanently in Washington D.C., where he maintained a private practice for over four decades and served his profession in several international capacities. He also remained involved with equestrianism, working closely with the sport at the national level in the United States and co-founding the United States Combined Training Association for Equestrian Eventing. He had three daughters, all of whom were involved in horse riding at some level, and he died in a Virginia retirement home in 2008.",

These posters were produced for several Swiss and international competitions, such as the 1928 Winter Games in St. Moritz. He submitted five posters, of which two were shown in the official catalogue. The tourist motif Poster for St. Moritz was created in 1926, or according to other information in 1920, probably just in black and white. Several posters were produced for a Ski Jumping Competition in Ponteresina, one in 1928, but also an earlier one from about 1924. The Poster for Athletic Competition in Bern was created from a color lithograph. The motif was also used for the 7th Swiss University Championships. Moos founded the Artists’ Association The Six, one of the first groups of artists for the marketing of advertising orders. He came to prominence for his series of sports posters, but also illustrated postcards dealing with the soldier’s life and postcards for München breweries. After his education at the Commercial Drawing and Modelling School in München, he worked as an illustrator for the München daily press. During World War I, he left München and settled in Zürich where he produced mountainscapes and genre paintings in oil, water color, and different graphical techniques. His expressionist designs for Wagner’s opera Tannhäuser were used for the staging in 1925 in Zürich. Until 1933, he was art director of the printing and bookselling company Orell Füssli.",

Kleine won a silver medal at the 1982 World Championships and a gold at the 1984 Olympics, on what is often considered the greatest ever amateur basketball team. He went on to a 16-year career in the NBA with seven different teams, almost always as a journeyman. Kleine was drafted by the Sacramento Kings in the first round of the 1985 NBA Draft, and played for them from 1985-89.

There, he married Augusta Preitinger, an artist he had met during a brief stint at the Royal Academy of Fine Arts in Rotterdam (they would divorce in 1921). Initially, Van Dongen earned a living as a house painter and magazine illustrator. Initially leaning towards the Impressionists, his breakthrough came in 1905 with a controversial exposition in the Salon d’Automne, which earned the artists on display the nickname Les Fauves („the wild beasts“), which eventually resulted in the fauvist style, characterized by crude forms and bright colors. Eventually he turned to the German Expressionists. He was originally known for painting (female) nudes, but from the 1920s he turned to portrait painting of famous persons – such as Aga Khan III, Maurice Chevalier and Brigitte Bardot – which is generally considered to be of lower artistic quality than his earlier work. In 1926, Van Dongen was made a Knight of the French Legion of Honor, and in 1929 he became a French citizen. He was also a close friend of Pablo Picasso. The last decade of his life, van Dongen lived in Monaco, where he died in 1968, aged 91. His younger brother, Jan van Dongen, was also an artist (a sculptor). The picture Boxing Exhibition, also titled Boxing Exhibition avec Charly was probably created in 1912, but the years 1905 and 1908 are also mentioned. The oil painting measures 131 x 97 cm. It shows members of the avant-garde literary and artistic circles while training in Van Dongen’s studio. British-Swiss poet, amateur boxer and artist Arthur Cravan is depicted while sparring with boxer Charley Macavoy, watched by art dealer Joseph Altounian. Another oil painting, Balancing (130 x 97 cm), was also created in 1907 but under the title L’équilibriste. It was auctioned at Sotheby’s in 2006 for around 2.5 million Euros.",

At the 1908 London Olympics, Filleul won a silver medal with the Leander coxless fours and was also a reserve to the eights that won the gold medal. It was thought that Filleul’s rowing career might be over in 1909 following a bizarre accident. He was coaching his Wadham College eight and was holding a starter’s gun containing black cartridges in one hand and a megaphone in the other. Wanting to transmit information to the crew from the river bank, he swapped gun and megaphone from one hand to the other and, unknown to Filleul, there was still a cartridge in the gun that went off while he had the barrel covered with his hand. He lost a lot of blood and suffered nerve damage. He recovered, however, and four months later was rowing in the Diamond Sculls at Henley. By profession, Filleul worked for the Government in the Colonial Service. Upon retiring, he devoted his time to his passion of bee keeping. His 26-year-old son, also called Philip, served in the Royal Air Force (RAF) in World War II and was killed in 1944 when returning from a sortie over Frankfurt with Bomber Division when their plane went missing in the English Channel.",

Although he competed in curling at the 1932 Olympic Winter Games he was best known for his contributions to golf and became known as Mr. Golf in his native Connecticut. When New Haven was planning to build a golf course in 1895, a friend found that Pryde had played the game in Scotland and Pryde designed the New Haven Golf Club, later The Club at Yale. He became the pro at the course, a job he would hold for 41 years. He also was the first golf coach at Yale, coaching them to the first NCAA title in 1897, and eventually winning 13 NCAA Championships with them, including nine in a row, 1905-13. Pryde became the Executive Director of the Connecticut State Golf Association, a position he held from 1922-46. He also became a prolific golf course designer, laying out, in addition to the original Yale course, Race Brook Country Club, Alling Memorial Golf Club, Wethersfield Country Club, Wyantenuck Golf Club, and The Montrose Club in Pennsylvania.

However, Rodnina and Zaytsev did not compete in 1979 as she was having a baby. But they returned for 1980 and the 1980 pairs battle between the two was expected to be one of the best events at the Lake Placid Olympics. But it never came to be. Gardner pulled a groin muscle in training at Lake Placid. On the day of the competition, he was given a local anaesthetic to kill the pain, but could not control his leg, and after dropping Babilonia several times in warm-ups, they were withdrawn and did not compete. Babilonia and Gardner had a long professional career together, skating through 2008 when a neck problem of Gardner’s forced their retirement. He has since become a skating choreographer.

Paddock was a lieutenant in the artillery at the time, and when he returned home he became the most famous track athlete of the twenties. He had a bouncing stride, high knee action and a famous “jump finish”. He always wore silk when he ran and, in addition to being a successful journalist, he was his own publicity manager. He thus presented an aura which endeared him to the sporting public and, to satisfy his admirers, he frequently set world records at a variety of odd and seldom contested distances. Paddock had a wonderful record in more traditional competition, as well. He won five AAU titles and officially equalled the world 100y record of 9.6 five times. Early in 1921 he ran 10.4 for 100 m to equal the world record, but his finest performance came two months later when he clocked 10.2 for 110 y (100.58 m) although this was not accepted as a world record because he had run more than 100m. Paddock was a Southern Cal graduate (‘23) who appeared in several movies-usually playing himself. He was later portrayed in the Oscar-winning film, “Chariots of Fire”, as the brash American – not totally untrue. Paddock was killed in an air crash over Alaska while serving as a captain in the Marines.

Mourning won a gold medal with the USA Team at the 2000 Sydney Olympics. He also helped the USA win gold at the 1994 World Championships (World Cup). Mourning played in college at Georgetown University, being named first team All-American as a senior and Big East Conference Player of the Year in 1992. In 1989, 1990, and 1992 he was the Big East’s Defensive Player of the Year and in 1989 led the NCAA in blocks. Mourning was selected by the Charlotte Hornets with the second overall pick of the 1992 NBA Draft. He played with the Hornets from 1992-95 and then was with the Miami Heat from 1995-2003 and again in 2005-08, after spending one year with the New Jersey Nets. Mourning helped the Miami Heat to the NBA title in 2006. He was a seven-time NBA All-Star, making the All-Star Game in 1994-97 and 2000-02. In 1999 he was named to the All-NBA First Team and in 2000 to the All-NBA Second Team. He led the NBA in blocks in 1999 and 2000, and in both years was named the NBA Defensive Player of the Year. Mourning won the 2002 J. Walter Kennedy Citizenship Award and his #33 was retired by the Miami Heat. For his 14-year NBA career Mourning averaged 17.1 points/game, 8.5 rebounds/game, and 2.8 blocks/game. He was elected to the FIBA Hall of Fame. Mourning achieved all this despite developing glomerulosclerosis, a chronic kidney disease that eventually put him into chronic renal failure and required him to receive a kidney transplant in December 2003 from a cousin. Remarkably, Mourning played five more years in the NBA after that transplant, despite having to be on immunosuppressive drugs the entire time because of the transplant. Mourning’s charitable and philanthropic contributions are legion. Mourning established Zo’s Fund for Life to raise funds for research, education, and testing for glomerulosclerosis. In 1997 he established Alonzo Mourning Charities Inc. to assist children and families living in at-risk situations. In 2003 he founded Overtown Youth Center in Miami to support and encourage underprivileged kids. In 2007 he helped found Athletes for Hope, a charitable organization that helps professional athletes get involved in charitable causes and volunteer and support communities. His co-founders of Athletes for Hope were Andre Agassi, Muhammad Ali, Lance Armstrong, Warrick Dunn, Mia Hamm, Jeff Gordon, Tony Hawk, Andrea Jaeger, Jackie Joyner-Kersee, Mario Lemieux, and Cal Ripken Jr.",Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the Basketball World Cup (1–0–1 1990 ARG bronze; 1994 CAN gold) Listed in Olympians Who Acted in Movies (Space Jam; Like Mike)

18288,"Dmitry, Grand Duke Pavlovich",Male,6 September 1891,,, Russian Federation,RUS,"Grand Duke Dmitri Pavlovich of Russia was the grandson of Tsar Alexander II and a cousin to Tsar Nicholas II. Born eight weeks prematurely, his mother, Princess Alexandra of Greece, died as a result of complications from the birth. His father was killed by anarchists during the abortive 1905 revolution and he was sent to live with the Tsar’s family in the Imperial Palace. The Grand Duke joined a guards regiment as an officer and showed expertise enough to be chosen to ride for Russia at the 1912 Stockholm Games. Although he finished in the top ten of the individual show jumping event, it is far away from the sporting field that he made his most important mark on history. In 1916 he was one of a group of conspirators that murdered Grigori Rasputin, it is even theorized that he may himself have fired one of the shots that eventually killed the “mad monk”. Because of his involvement in the murder he was sent to fight to Persia, thereby avoiding the fate of the Russian royal family at the hand of the Bolsheviks. He was smuggled away via Persia and India and eventually found safe refuge in London. The Grand Duke had a reputation as a womanizer, counting the Duchess of Marlborough and Coco Chanel amongst his conquests, but also was reputed to have had a relationship with Prince Felix Yusopov, one of his fellow conspirators. He was later to marry Audrey Emery, an American heiress and their son, Paul, would go on to be mayor of Palm Beach, Florida. During the thirties he had links to the proto-fascist Mladorossi Movement but refused the invitation when Hitler asked him to lead exiled Russian nobles in the German army to fight against the USSR. After suffering for a number of years with tuberculosis, he died in a Swiss sanatorium from acute uremia, although rumours abounded that he was the victim of a Nazi plot.",Listed in Olympian Members of the Nobility (Grand Duke Dmitri Pavlovich of Russia) Listed in Olympians of Royal Blood (Grand Duke Dmitri Pavlovich of Russia)

The second son of a Nigerian father and Scottish mother, Daley showed a remarkable aptitude for sport while at boarding school in Sussex. Initially he was a member of Haywards Health Harriers but when he returned to London in 1975 he joined the Essex Beagles club. Later that year he won the first two decathlon competitions he entered, while in 1976 he won the AAA title and was the 18th at the Montréal Olympic Games. The following year, he won the European Junior Title and in 1978 came the first of his three Commonwealth titles. In 1979, he failed to finish in his only decathlon of the year but won the long jump at the UK Championships. He then opened the 1980 Olympic season with a world decathlon record of 8,648 points at Götzis, Austria, in May, and followed this with a comfortable win at the Moscow Olympics. After a quiet 1981 season he was in devastating form in 1982; back at Götzis in May, he raised the world record to 8,730 points and then in September, at the European Championships in Athens, he took the record up to 8,774 points. The following month in Brisbane, Thompson took his second Commonwealth title. In 1983 Daley was crowned the all-round king at the inaugural World Athletics Championships and became the first decathlete to hold the European, World and Olympic titles simultaneously. He spent much of the summer of 1984 in California preparing for the defense of his Olympic title, with Jürgen Hingsen, the West German who had taken over from Thompson as the world record holder, expected to be a major threat. Thompson took the lead in the first event and was never headed throughout the competition, although it seemed that, by easing off in the 1,500 metres he had missed recapturing the world record by just one point. When the photo-finish pictures were examined, however, it was found that Thompson should have been credited with one more point in the 110 metres hurdles so he had in fact, equaled Hingsen’s record. Then when the new scoring tables were introduced, Thompson became the sole record holder once more with a recalculated score of 8,847 points. His two victories in the decathlon are a feat shared only with the American Bob Mathias. After his Olympic success, Thompson won his third Commonwealth title in 1986 but after that he never quite recaptured the superlative form of earlier years. In 1987 he suffered his first decathlon defeat for nine years when he finished ninth in the World Championships, and at his fourth Olympics in Seoul in 1988 he finished fourth. He made the Commonwealth Games team for the fourth time in 1990 but was forced to withdraw because of injury and retired when a recurring hamstring injury wrecked his attempt to qualify for the 1992 Olympic Games. After he left the track he embarked on a brief career as a footballer in the lower leagues of English football before becoming a fitness coach with professional clubs Wimbledon and Luton Town. Later he became a motivational speaker and personal fitness coach as well as being an ambassador for the London Olympic bid. Apart from his four world records and numerous victories in major championships, Daley Thompson set three world junior records and bettered the UK and Commonwealth record no less than ten times. As befits such a talented all-round athlete, Thompson produced some fine individual performances in the events which go to make up the decathlon; he was the AAA long jump champion in 1977 and was the lead-off man for the sprint relay team at the 1984 Olympics.

Throughout her long career she won over 100 singles and doubles titles, many on the French and Italian Riviera where she moved after her divorce from fellow tennis player Clement Satterthwaite in the early 1920s. Successes in Great Britain included the Hertfordshire title five times between 1920-25, the Welsh covered court title in 1921 and the Welsh Championship in 1927. But it was in Southern France that she enjoyed most of her triumphs, winning the Monaco Championship four times and appearing in nine consecutive finals between 1922-30. She was also the women’s doubles world hard court champion with Dorothy Holman in 1920. Satterthwaite played at Wimbledon from 1911 to 1935, when she was aged 49. She never progressed beyond the quarter-final in either doubles events, but twice reached the All-comers singles final, losing 6-1, 6-1 to Suzanne Lenglen of France in 1919 and in 1921 was beaten even heavier, 6-1, 6-0, by Elizabeth Ryan of the United States. At the 1924 Olympics Helen competed only in the singles and following a bye and a walkover in the first two rounds came up against Helen Wills in round three. The American won 6-1, 6-2 and then went on to win the gold medal. Well known for engaging in many long rallies, Phyllis is believed to have been involved in the longest rally on record during her match with Lucia Valerio in the final of the Bordighera championship on the Italian Riviera in March 1930. The rally lasted over 19 and a half minutes and Satterthwaite won the point and with it, the title for the third time. Phyllis was an accomplished journalist and author and wrote books entitled “Lawn Tennis for Women”, “Tips for Tennis Players” and “Lawn Tennis Champions of the Riviera”. She also contributed tennis stories and articles to newspapers and was a regular contributor to the weekly magazine “The Bystander.” At the outbreak of World War II she lived in France before returning to England in 1942. Phyllis Satterthwaite died in 1962 and in her will she left nearly all of her £137,000 estate to be shared between nine animal charities because, as she said, she: “hated all human beings.”",

Rossi’s last Olympic appearance was in Beijing, where he carried the Italian flag during the opening. He now contested the K-4 event, but was unable to win a sixth medal, finishing fourth in the final. Apart from the Olympics, Rossi also starred at World Championships. His best event was the K-2 1,000, winning medals in five consecutive championships. After silver in 1993 and 1994, he won his first title in 1995 (all with Scarpa).

It appears he was born in Chicago, to English parents, of some wealth. He lived for a time at the Friar’s Club in New York, the Savoy Plaza Hotel in New York, and later in Hollywood, indicating he had some connection to the entertainment industry. In fact, he worked in musical comedy and summer stock in Chicago, and he did some vaudeville.

His Olympic début came in 1988, when short-track speed skating was still a demonstration sport. Fagone reached two finals, finishing third (1,500 m) and 2nd (relay). Successful years followed, winning 5 world titles, two with the relay squad (1988 and 1996), one at the World Team Championships (1993) and two individually (500 m in 1996, 3,000 m in 1994). His two subsequent Olympic appearances (1992, 1994) did not see Fagone progress beyond the quarter-final stage in individual events, but in the 1994 relay event, he earned a gold medal together with Maurizio Carnino, Hugo Herrnhof and Mirko Vuillermin. Hoping to defend his title in Nagano, life changed drastically for Fagone on 30 May 1997, when a motorcycle accident ended his career. His right leg was amputated, and Fagone has been bound to his wheelchair since. This did not stop him from practising sports, and he picked up ice sledge hockey. A three-time national champion, Fagone was picked for the 2006 Paralympic team. This made Fagone the third Winter Olympian to also compete in the Paralympics, and the first disabled one (the other two were sighted guides).","Listed in Olympians Who Competed in the Paralympics (Competed in 2006 Winter Paralympics) Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the European Short Track Speed Skating Championships (0–0–1 1997 Malmö bronze: 5000 m relay) Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the World Short Track Speed Skating Championships (2–3–2 1987 Montréal silver: 5000 m relay; 1988 St. Louis gold: 5000 m relay; 1993 Beijing silver: 5000 m relay; 1995 Gjøvik silver: 5000 m relay; 1996 Den Haag gold: 5000 m relay, bronze: Allround; 1997 Nagano bronze: 5000 m relay) Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the World Short Track Speed Skating Team Championships (1–1–3 1992 Nobeyama silver; 1993 Budapest gold; 1994 Cambridge bronze; 1996 Lake Placid bronze; 1997 Seoul bronze) Listed in Olympians Who Received the Italian Olympic Association (CONI) Gold Medal ()"

In 1907 he was the first Pole to join the Vienna Secession. Between the two World Wars he lived in Praha, Paris and Kraków. As he was married to a Jewish woman, he had to flee from the Nazi invasion in 1939, through the Soviet Union and Turkey to Palestine. After World War II Hofman returned to Poland. He painted mainly religious and mythological motives, and became well-known for his paintings of Madonna, children and angels in rural locations, and portraits. He was representative of the young-Polish symbolism, influenced by painter Jacek Malczewski (1854-1929), and also wrote essays and poems. Hofman remained uninfluenced by the styles of 20th century modernism. He submitted oil paintings on canvas showing images of players from the “Wisła Kraków” soccer team. Two footballers shows, amongst others, player Jan Reyman (1902-84) and is exhibited in the conference room of the club. Team Wisła was painted after Hofman promised to portray the entire winning team on canvas in life size if they were to win the Polish Cup in 1926, which they did. In 1927 he created the painting with dimensions 210 x 488 cm. The team is shown standing under the wings of the Goddess of Victory, who is holding the Polish Cup in her hand.

Upon his return to Canada, he gained attention on the amateur boxing scene as a rising star and was selected to represent Canada in the middleweight division at the 1920 Summer Olympics. At the Games he had little trouble with his early-round opponents, knocking-out Belgium’s Antoine Masson, France’s Marcel Rey-Golliet, and Norway’s Hjalmar Strømme before losing to Britain’s Harry Mallin in the final and settling for silver. In the same event, his countryman Moe Herscovitch won bronze. Prud’homme continued to box as an amateur until 1922, when a dearth of challengers led him to turn professional.

In April 1957, Gutowski cleared 15-8¼ (4.78) to become the new world record holder, and later in the season he improved to 15-9¾ (4.82), but the height was not approved as a world record because the pole passed under the bar, in contravention of IAAF rules. Gutowski finished fourth at the 1956 Final Trials and only made the team after Jim Graham withdrew. As a contemporary of Don Bragg and Bob Richards, Gutowski found championships hard to come by, but he tied Bragg for the 1958 AAU indoor title and while at Occidental he tied for the NCAA title in 1956, winning it outright in 1957. Gutowski was also a talented long jumper and his best mark of 24-8¾ (7.54) came in the 1960 AAU decathlon. This was to be his last major competition – less than one month later, at the age of 25, he was killed in an automobile accident.

In addition, she was nine times Swedish Champion in various events. Wiberg was most successful in the slalom with 14 World Cup victories. She won the Slalom World Cup once and was runner-up in five years, three times beaten by her Swiss rival Vreni Schneider. Her best season was the winter of 1996-97, in which she participated in every race of the five events, a total of 32. In 24 of them she made the top five including nine victories, five second and four third places. In this season, she accomplished a new record of points achieved in the overall World Cup score winning the overall, slalom and combined World Cups and ranking third, fourth and fifth in the super-G, downhill and giant slalom scores, respectively. In the super-G World Cup she was ahead before she had to drop out of the last race and, thus, gave way to the German Hilde Gerg. She became 1991 World Champion in the giant slalom, in 1996 in the slalom and the combined event, in 1999 again in the combined event and was runner-up in the slalom and in 1997 downhill bronze medalist, giving her a total of four gold medals and one silver and bronze medal each at World Championships. She was similarly successful at the Winter Olympics with gold in the 1992 giant slalom at Albertville, gold in the 1994 combined event at Lillehammer and silver in the 1998 downhill in Nagano. She was flagbearer for Sweden at the Opening Ceremony of the 1994 Winter Olympics. Pernilla Wiberg was the first Swedish female to become World and Olympic champion in alpine skiing. During her career she suffered various severe injuries, e.g. rupture of the cruciate ligament, meniscal problems and broken ribs, which probably prevented her from winning additional titles and medals. During her active career she underwent a total of 12 knee surgeries. Following her disappointing appearance at Salt Lake City in 2002, she retired from international competition. From 2002-10 she was an Athlete Member of the IOC. In 1991 she received the gold medal of the Svenska-Dagbladet newspaper and in 1991 and 1992 the annual award of the sport section of Sveriges Radio.

921016,Kazu Wakita,Male,7 June 1908,,, Japan,JPN,"During his time at school, Kazu Wakita became acquainted with Tameshige Shodai, a well-known Japanese artist, who gave him first guidance in charcoal drawing and oil painting. In 1923 Wakita dropped out of school to accompany his family to Berlin, where they worked for the Mitsubishi Co. In Berlin he attended Max Rabe’s painting school and in 1925 enrolled in the Berlin State School of Fine Arts in Erich Wolfsfeld’s class. On his return home in 1927 Wakita developed an interest in photography. In the following year he resumed his studies in Berlin in etching and woodcutting. In 1930 he took part in the Freie Kunstschau (Free Art Exhibition) and graduated, receiving a gold medal from his school. Upon his father’s death, he took over his trading company in Tokyo, running it for the next 10 years. During this time, he opened a studio in Tokyo’s Kugahara quarter and continued to exhibit his works at various important shows, winning the first prize at the 13th Emperor Exhibition. Wakita later turned away from official exhibitions and presented his paintings at the Second Society’s Nika Exhibitions. In 1936, Wakita was one of the founders of the Shineisaku-ha-kyôkai (New Creation Group). In 1938 he went to Shanghai in occupied China and later to the Philippines to work as a military artist, before he returned in 1944. When his studio was burned he lost most of his pre-war works. Together with some fellow painters, he was evacuated to Fujino village near Sagamiko (now Sagamihara) in Kanagawa Prefecture. After the end of the war Wakita established a new studio in the Setagaya district, and was engaged in initiating the Japan Art Association for a democratic understanding of art. As one of the first Japanese post-war artists he participated in international exhibitions, for instance in São Paulo, Pittsburgh and New Delhi. In 1954, a book in a series about modern Japanese painters presents the work of Kazu Wakita while his picture Arasoi (Strife) received the highest award at the 3rd Japan International Art Exhibition and the 1st Guggenheim International Art Award. Subsequently, he made lengthy visits to the United States and France. Back in Japan, Wakita became a lecturer for printmaking at the Tokyo University of the Arts and was appointed professor in 1968. In the 1970s and 80s Wakita was honored by various exhibitions and books concentrating on his more recent works. In the 1980s he made trips abroad to the United States and various major cities in Europe. In 1991, the Wakita Museum of Art was opened in the town of Karuizawa, Nagano prefecture. The last decade of his life was marked by major exhibitions world-wide. Wakita represented contemporary Japanese oil painting, often portraying lovely birds, flowers, and children which were a part of his daily life, his style being described by geniality, purity and warmth. After the war, a bird was often incorporated in his works, symbolizing abstract concepts such as peace and human nature. He always maintained a critical attitude to the politics of the art world. Wakita submitted a print at the 1936 art competitions.",

49220,Felipe Muñoz,Male,3 February 1951,181.0,74, Mexico,MEX,"Felipe Muñoz was nicknamed El Tibio which means lukewarm in English, because his father came from Aguascalientes, meaning hot waters, and his mother was from Rio Frio, meaning cold river. At only 17-years-old Muñoz was the surprise winner of the 200 breaststroke at the 1968 Olympics. He was not considered a favorite in the 1968 breaststroke events, those roles going to the world record holder Vladimir Kosinsky, and 1964 Olympic winner Ian O’Brien, but Muñoz surprised everyone by qualifying with the fastest time. The Mexico City Olympics had lasted for 10 days and Mexico had yet to win a gold medal, and the final has been described as one of the most emotional in Olympic history. Muñoz was in fourth place at 100 metres, but began closing on the lead. With 50 meters to go, he exploded off the wall to pass three swimmers, getting close to Kosinsky, who had led throughout. The crowd went wild, chanting in unison for their native countryman, “Mu-ñoz, Mu-ñoz, Mu-ñoz.” Muñoz caught Kosinsky at 175 metres and pulled away in the final metres to win a surprising gold and sparked a celebration that lasted for hours. Muñoz returned to the Olympics four years later 1972, as the flagbearer for Mexico at the Opening Ceremony and placed fifth in the 200 breaststroke. Besides his Olympic gold, he won silver in the 200 breast and bronze in the 200 IM at the 1971 Pan-American Games, bronze in the 200 breast at the 1973 Universiade, golds in both breaststrokes at the 1970 and 1974 Central American and Caribbean Games, and gold in the medley relay at the 1970 Central American and Caribbean Games. After finishing his swimming career, Muñoz became a sports official. A graduate of the University of Texas, Muñoz worked as a TV commentator before serving as deputy director of the communications department at the National Commission for Physical Culture and Sport of Mexico (CONADE). From 1985-2001, he was head of the Mexican Sports Confederation (CODEME) and led the Mexican delegation at the 1996, 2000 and 2004 Olympics. From 2001-12, Muñoz was president of the Mexican National Olympic Committee and was the treasurer, then secretary-general, and later vice-president of Pan American Sports Organization (PASO). In 2012, he was elected as a deputy to the LXII Legislature of the Mexican Congress as a member of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI).

He was equally at home playing rugby for Berkshire Wanderers, cricket and football (association) for Aldermaston, or as a sprint and middle-distance runner with Reading Harriers. But it was as a boxer that he was better known. However, before turning his hand to pugilism, Evans was a wrestler and weightlifter of note in the Reading area, having attended the Reading School of Physical Culture. Fighting as a heavyweight, Evans competed in his first ABA Championship in 1908, and came away as champion. It would be Evans’ only ABA final. Shortly afterwards, he had the honour of sparring in front of the reigning Monarch, King Edward VII, the first amateur boxer to do so. Evans went to the London Olympics later in the year, but a chronic bout of neuralgia leading up to the Games meant he was nowhere near peak form. However, he still managed to inflict first round knockouts on two formidable opponents, Albert Ireton and Frank Parks, on his way to the final. But he then came up against Albert Oldman, and was himself knocked out in the first round, in a fight that barely lasted a minute, but Evans still received a silver medal. Sadly, ill health forced Evans to miss the opportunity to defend his ABA title in 1909. Evans spent six years with the Berkshire Yeomanry at the turn of the 20th century. He later ran his own Physical Culture School, became a boxing referee, and also wrote boxing articles for a local newspaper. In his spare time, he used to create and exhibit flower presentations, a hobby not normally associated with a heavyweight boxer. Sid Evans died in 1927 at the age of 45, after contracting double pneumonia.",

Da Silva was already selected for the 1948 Brazilian Olympic team, where he finished eighth in the triple jump. In December 1950 he equaled the triple jump world record of 16.00, set by Naoto Tajima at the 1936 Olympics and won triple jump gold at the 1951 Pan American Games before setting a world record of 16.01 in September 1951, which stamped him as the clear favorite at the 1952 Helsinki Olympics. He did not disappoint, winning the gold medal comfortably, setting two world records in the final – 16.12 in round two and 16.22 in round five. In fact, he bettered the previous world record in Helsinki four times, posting 16.09 in round four and 16.05 in the final round. It was remarkable because 16 metres had been jumped only three times before, twice by da Silva himself and once by Tajima. After Helsinki, da Silva defended his Pan American title with a world record of 16.56 in 1955 and went to the 1956 Olympics as the favorite. In Melbourne he defended his title with an Olympic record 16.35 in round four. Da Silva last medaled at an international tournament at the 1959 Pan American Games, where he won his third Pan American triple jump title, and last competed internationally at the 1960 Olympics, where he was last, 14th, in the final. In 1959 da Silva had an acting role at a musical film Orfeu Negro based on a play Orfeu da Conceição by Vinicius de Moraes, portraying Death, which won the Golden Palm of the Cannes Film Festival and an Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. The film is an adaptation of the Greek legend of Orpheus and Eurydice, set in the modern context of a favela in Rio de Janeiro during Carnaval. Da Silva graduated as a sculptor from the Federal Institute of São Paulo in 1948, received a physical education degree from the Preparatory School of Cadets of the Brazilian Army, law degree from the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro in 1968, and a public relations degree in 1990 from the Faculdade Cásper Líbero, a private university in São Paulo.

Born into a family of doctors, he had a relatively affluent upbringing, but suffered misfortunes during World War II which saw his family lose most of their money, further exacerbated by the death of his father in 1945. Fitting sought out to follow his family’s tradition in the sport of fencing while attending schooling to eventually become a dentist. He was afflicted with an autoimmune condition, myasthenia gravis, which made the long nature of fencing tournaments difficult on his body, but learned how to manage. He was eventually selected in 1952 for the Swiss national fencing delegation to compete in the Helsinki Olympics, and at the age of 27, was one of its youngest members. There, he won a bronze medal in the épée team event alongside Otto Rüfenacht, Paul Meister, Oswald Zappelli, Paul Barth and Mario Valota.

He turned to the 6-metre class in the mid-1920s, competing at the 1928 Amsterdam Games in the 6-metre class at the helm of Twins II. At the 1936 Olympic Games Reggio skippered the Italian boat Italia to a gold medal. The boat, built at the Attilio Costaguta shipyard in Genova Voltri, was launched on 20 June 1936, just under two months before the Games, and transported by train to Germany. The final result was uncertain since in the fifth race there were a series of protests, and the final decision was only reached after the end of all races, thanks to the Official Film by the German director Leni Riefenstahl, which resolved the issue. The win at the Berlin Olympics remains unique, as an Italian crew won with a boat designed and built in Italy. Born in 1888, Reggio was one of the best Italian sailors for decades. He was Italian class champion from 1937 to 1939, on the first two occasions accompanied by his son Pietro, among others. He competed at the 1948 London Olympics in the 6-metre class, finishing eighth. Italia continued to sail the waters of the Gulf of Napoli while being moored at Molosiglio in the nautical base of the Naval League and has been recognized by the Ministry of Cultural Heritage as a “historical asset”.",Father of Pietro Reggio Listed in Olympians Who Received the Italian Olympic Association (CONI) Gold Medal ()

One of the top Italian foil and sabre fencers throughout the 1920s, Puliti struggled in individual Olympic events, finishing fourth at both individual sabre at the 1920 Olympics and individual foil at the 1928 Olympics. He was also seventh in individual foil at the 1920 Olympics and reached the final pool in individual sabre at the 1924 Olympics, but was disqualified. In the 1924 sabre competition, four Italians – Puliti, Marcello Bertinetti, Bino Bini and Giulio Sarrocchi reached the final and the three Italians were drawn against Puliti in the first bouts of the final pool. Puliti, by far the best Italian sabre fencer, won those three bouts with ease, but the Jury of Appeal, led by Hungarian judge György Kovács, ruled that the Italians had thrown their matches to Puliti to allow him a better chance to win gold. Puliti was incensed and threatened to cane Kovács, which caused the jury to disqualify Puliti. Two days later, when he saw Kovács again, Puliti punched him in the face and a formal duel was proposed. The two combatants met again four months later at Nagykanizsa in southwestern Hungary, near the current Serbian border. The duel lasted for an hour, at which time the two were stopped by spectators who were concerned about the many wounds the two had received. Puliti and Kovács then shook hands and honor was restored. Puliti did win four Olympic team gold medals (team foil / team sabre – 1920, team sabre – 1924, team foil – 1928) and one silver (team sabre – 1928). He was also the World individual foil champion in 1927 and 1929 and a team foil champion in 1929. He won Italian foil titles in 1921 and 1923 and was sabre champion in 1921-23. Puliti turned professional in 1930 and later coached fencing at Livorno and after World War II in Lucca. After his death Associazione Scherma Lucca was re-named the Associazione Oreste Puliti.","Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the World Fencing Championships (3–0–0 1927 Vichy gold: foil; 1929 Napoli gold: foil and foil team) Listed in Olympic Fencers - Winning Gold Medals, Foil/Sabre (1920 Foil, Team; 1920 Sabre, Team; 1924 Sabre, Team; 1928 Foil, Team.)

He played in Italy with Padova (1924-25), with Internazionale Milano (1925-26), followed by training for a season with U.S. Alessandria before returning to the Milano team. Weisz lead Ambrosiana-Inter to victory in the 1929-30 season as the youngest-ever coach (age 34) and winner of the Italian title, when the 17-year-old Giuseppe Meazza made his first team début. He validated his time with Bologna by bringing the Rossoblù team two titles (1936, 1937). In June 1937 they beat Chelsea F.C. 4-1 at the Exposition Trophy in Paris, the preview to the European Champions Cup. In front of a Parisian audience, the Italian team stunned French spectators and journalists. At a very young age Weisz was called to arms by the Austro-Hungarian Army and was taken prisoner by Italian troops. In 1938, Weisz was forced to flee Italy because of his Jewish origins. Settling first in Paris and then in the Netherlands, Weisz coached the Dordrechtschte Football Club team with excellent results. In May 1942 the situation began to deteriorate significantly. The Nazi’s had conquered The Netherlands, the Jews were forced to wear a yellow star on their jackets, his children Roberto and Clara had been expelled from school, and Weisz himself was no longer able to work, having been fired from Dordrecht because of a threat from the police station. Initially managing to survive, on 2 August 1942, the Weisz’s were arrested by the Gestapo and a few days later, they arrived at the Westerbork transit camp in the north-east of The Netherlands where Anne Frank died, among others. On 2 October 1942 the Weisz family left by train bound for Auschwitz and on 7 October, his wife Elena Rechnitzer, and their children, Roberto and Clara, were immediately gassed. Together with about 300 other men, Weisz was sent to the labour camps of Upper Silesia in Koźle, Poland and after 15 months of forced labour, was brought back to Auschwitz, where he died in a gas chamber on 31 January 1944, at only 47-years-old. Forgotten for almost 60 years, in 2007 Weisz’s name was rediscovered thanks to journalist Matteo Marani, who wrote about him in Dallo Scudetto ad Auschwitz (From the Scudetto to Auschwitz). In 2009, the Municipality of Bologna created the first official commemoration for Weisz with a plaque dedicated to him under the Marathon tower of the Renato Dall’Ara stadium. In 2018, the San Luca curve of the same stadium was also named after him. In 2017 Matteo Matteucci wrote the book Árpád Weisz e il Littoriale and in 2018 Paolo Balbi authored Árpád Weisz: il tempo, gli uomini, I luoghi.",Listed in Olympians Who Died in Nazi Concentration Camps (Auschwitz concentration camp) Listed in Olympians Who Were Killed or Missing in Action or Died as a Result of War (†31 October 1944.

36035,Silken Laumann,Female,14 November 1964,180.0,72, Canada,CAN,"Silken Laumann is the greatest female rower ever produced by Canada. Her brilliant career has lacked only an individual sculling gold medal, but her failure to win gold at the 1992 Olympics may have been her finest moment in sport. Laumann began her sports career as a runner but at age 17 turned to rowing along with her older sister, Danièle. They quickly advanced to the Canadian national team, and in 1984 at Los Angeles, teamed to win a bronze medal in the Olympic double sculls. After Danielle retired from the sport, Silken Laumann continued with other partners and began to scull a single as well. In 1985, she finished 4th at the World Championships in the single sculls. After a single sculls gold medal at the 1987 Pan-American Games, she returned to the doubles for the 1988 Olympics at Seoul, finishing 7th with Kay Worthington. After the 1988 Olympics, Silken Laumann focused almost exclusively on the single sculls. She finished 7th at the 1989 World Championships and progressed to 2nd in 1990, before winning the singles World Championship in 1991. She dominated women’s sculling in that year, also winning international titles at Lucerne, San Diego, and Hazelwinkel (BEL) as part of the World Cup. With the 1992 Olympics on the horizon, Silken Laumann was the heavy favorite to win the gold medal in single sculls at Barcelona. But shortly before the Barcelona Olympics, training at a lake in Essen, Germany on 16 May 1992, her dreams were shattered. Another scull and she collided and the impact drove a piece of the splashboard into Laumann’s leg. She sustained an open tibia fracture, with concurrent nerve damage, which permanently weakened her leg. She also lost skin and soft tissue that required multiple operations. She noted that “The muscles on the outside of my right leg were peeled back and hanging down to the ankle … the doctors thought I would never row again.” Her gold medal plans seemed doomed but she refused to quit. Pushing herself into rehab, she determined to compete at Barcelona, even if she was at less than her previous dominant self, “I will not forget getting back into the shell. I love the sport so much, but I didn’t fully realize it until I got out there. I just sat in the boat for a time, pushed off the dock, then started to cry. It was wonderful.” Laumann did not win the single sculls at Barcelona, but she did medal, finishing 3rd behind her arch-rival, Romania’s Elisabeta Lipa. Olympic chronicler, Bud Greenspan, said it best, “Canada won four gold medals and one bronze medal in rowing at Lake Banyoles. Let the word go out that on this day the bronze medal shone as brightly in the Barcelona sun as any of the gold.” Laumann’s career did not end at Barcelona. Still with nerve and muscle damage to her injured leg, she finished 2nd at the Worlds in 1995 in the singles, and repeated that finish for an Olympic silver medal at Atlanta in 1996 before retiring. But it was her courageous performance at Barcelona for which she will always be best remembered.",Sister of Danièle Laumann Wife (divorced) of John Wallace Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the Summer Pan American Games (2–0–0 1987 Indianapolis ROW gold: single sculls; 1995 Mar del Plata ROW gold: single sculls) Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the Summer Universiade (0–0–1 1987 Zagreb ROW bronze: single sculls)

He won the Sir William Burton Trophy in 1939 and 1950 in his 12-footer and was four times the winner of the Prince of Wales’s Cup in his 14-foot dinghy between 1950-55. He was regarded as one of the best British helmsmen of the era and was a reserve for the Firefly class at the 1948 Olympics in Torbay. Banks got his chance to appear at the Olympics in 1952 when he partnered Stanley Potter in the two-person Star class. Their boat Fortuna finished 13th. Four years later, the same pair improved to finish eighth in Starlight III. Also in 1956, Banks took part in the inaugural Finn World Championship at Burnham and, despite winning the last race, finished eighth overall. Banks trained as a civil engineer and in turn founded his own sail-making company, Bruce Banks Sails Limited, in 1961, and he sought to design the perfect sail. The company soon got a reputation and their sails were used for anything upward from dinghies to 12-metre vessels. Banks later became chairman of the British Sailmakers’ Association and also served on the technical committee of the Royal Ocean Racing Club. Banks lost his life when his car crashed on the M27 in Hampshire and he died at the Alexandra Hospital, Portsmouth. An inquest two months later revealed he had fallen asleep after going into a diabetic coma. He was on his way home after competing in, and winning, a regatta.

He began rowing with the Chamonix and Montrose Boat Clubs of Philadelphia, but in 1909 he joined the Vesper Boat Club. Between 1909 and his competitive retirement after the 1924 Olympics, Kelly won every sculling title available to him, including the World Championship in both singles and doubles, the Olympics in singles and doubles, and many national titles in both boats. In 1919 and 1920, he won the national single sculls title over both the sprint distance (¼-mile) and 1½ miles. Kelly never won the Diamond Sculls at the Henley Regatta because he was denied entry. The usual rumor is that he was considered a professional by the Henley authorities, because his trade, as a contractor, gave him an unfair advantage in that it required him to use his muscles for strengthening, but that is false. In fact, all members of Vesper Boat Club were banned for what were considered, to the British, earlier professional activities. Kelly would certainly have won that title had he been allowed to compete and in later years had the last laugh on the British when his “bricklaying” led to a lucrative business as a contractor in Philadelphia. Kelly fathered two very famous children – John Kelly, Jr., another Olympic rower, who became President of the U.S. Olympic Committee, and the late Grace Kelly, the American movie star who later became Princess Grace of Monaco.","Father of Jack Kelly, Jr. Grandfather of Albert, Prince Grimaldi Father-in-law of Mary Freeman Father-in-law of Rainier III, Prince Grimaldi Cousin of Paul Costello Great-grandfather of Pauline Ducruet"

Having come second out of 225 starters in the 1908 Northern Junior Cross-Country championships at Haydock Park racecourse, Wyatt also finished second to Fred Lord in the Salford Harriers 20 mile Olympic trial four months before the 1908 Olympics. He was just 300 yards behind Lord, and seven minutes clear of the third placed man which enhanced his selection for the GB team. He was then chosen to represent the North in the Olympic trial in London shortly afterwards but was forced to pull out with less than 10 miles gone through illness. The selectors, however, decided that on his form going into the final trial he was worthy for selection for the British team. Personal Best: Mar – unknown.",

While at Stanford Eastman won the IC4A 880 yards in 1931-32. Early the following season, Eastman came up with what was probably the most impressive performance of an outstanding career. Running for Stanford against the Los Angeles AC on his home track at Palo Alto, he clocked 46.4 to clip exactly one second off the world 440 y record, which he already shared. Later the same afternoon he ran a 45.9 relay leg. Eastman followed this in June with 1:50.9 for 880 y, having been timed enroute at 1:50.0 for 800 m – both world records. On the advice of his coach, Dink Templeton, Eastman ran the 400 m at the 1932 Olympics, but could not match the finishing speed of Bill Carr. Eastman continued to run for several years, mostly at longer distances. He set world records for 500 m, 600 y, 800 m and 880 y before he took off 20 months because of business commitments. Eastman won the 1934 AAU title at 800 metres, but after placing fifth in the 800 m at the 1936 Olympic Trials, he retired. After his athletic career ended, Eastman worked for a diesel engine company and then started an equipment business, but eventually he moved to Colorado and grew fruit, setting up an orchard with a kit from the Sears catalog. He served on the Colorado Agriculture Commission for 12 years, and died of pneumonia at age 91. Personal Bests: 200 – 21.4 (1933); 440y – 46.4 (1932); 880y – 1:49.8 (1934).",

His first marriage was with the singer Johanna Swan, while he later married the sculptor Renée Sintenis. After his studies, he worked for a few years in Hagen for the arts patron Karl Ernst Osthaus (1854-1921). Weiß defined himself more and more as a painter, creating still lifes, portraits, landscapes, and genre scenes. His works are characterized by a pastose application of paint over large areas and a preference for earthy shades of color. In 1910 Weiß was appointed professor at the Berlin School of Applied Arts, where he led the special class for decorative mural painting and pattern drawing until 1933. In that year he was declared “degenerate” by the Nazis, and in 1937 was expelled from the Prussian Academy of Arts. He then lived exclusively from his book art and typography work, retreating more and more often to his native Baden. The poem Speerkampf (Spear Fight) transcribed by Weiß was - as in the case of Rudolf Koch - written by Karl Schenk, who also entered it in the literature section in Amsterdam.

She was also fourth, behind golfer Ada MacKenzie, Hilda Strike, and Mary Frizzell, in the first-ever vote for Canada’s female athlete of the year, which would eventually become the Bobbie Rosenfeld Award.

It was not until early in 1892 that Ritchie, by then aged 21, began to take lawn tennis seriously. Seven years later, he won the French covered courts singles championship and from then on he compiled an impressive record of success both at home and on the Continent. At the 1908 Olympics, with Ritchie meeting the German, Otto Froitzheim, in the final the 22-year-old German surprisingly elected to take on Ritchie, 15 years his senior, from the baseline. Ritchie had few peers at this type of game and as Froitzheim was not one of them he lost to the English veteran in straight sets. Ritchie also won an Olympic silver medal in the doubles with James Parke as his partner and earlier in the same year had won a bronze in the covered court doubles. Major Ritchie won the Wimbledon doubles in 1908 and 1910, partnering the New Zealander, Tony Wilding, with his best performance in the Wimbledon singles coming in 1909 when he won through to the Challenge round only to lose to Wentworth Gore in five sets.

Unfortunately, despite being selected, Barnes had to miss the European Championships in Budapest that year, and his place was taken by Case. Barnes failed to retain his ABA title in 1935, losing in the semi-final to Case, but enjoyed a great moment later that year when he beat future American world NBA featherweight champion Petey Scalzo in front of 48,000 fans at New York’s Yankee Stadium in a “Golden Gloves” match between Great Britain and the United States. Barnes won a second ABA bantamweight title in 1936 when his opponent was again Case who, unfortunately, had to withdraw with a shoulder injury. Later that year at the Berlin Olympics, Barnes was defeated in his second round contest by the eventual bronze medallist Fidel Ortíz of Mexico. Barnes, who represented Wales as a teenager, rounded off a successful career by capturing his third ABA title in 1937 at the expense of fellow Cardiff boxer Jackie Pottinger.

Since he had lost the distal tips of the index and middle fingers of his right hand in an accident, Straßberger had difficulty getting a tight grip on the barbell to master the heavy loads of the clean & jerk. Therefore, he always had to compensate for his modest performances in that lift by better performances in his strongest discipline, the military press.

Weston left Chicago in 1906 and moved to near Los Angeles but returned to Chicago to study at the Illinois College of Photography. In 1910 he opened his own studio, “The Little Studio”, in Topico, California. He later met Margrethe Mather, who became his assistant and then a partner in his studio. In the early 1920s Weston travelled to New York to study with Alfred Stieglitz, then the most prominent American photographer. Weston specialized in nude photographs of women, which caused some problems with his marriage, and his relationship with his nude subjects often went beyond mere photography. Weston started out in the genre of soft focus pictorialism, which was popular in the early 20th century, but he eventually moved to highly detailed photography, at which he was a pioneer. Weston wrote detailed journals concerning his work, which were later housed at The Center for Creative Photography at the University of Arizona. Weston travelled extensively in Mexico and then set up a studio in Carmel, California. He became quite well-known and had multiple exhibits of his works. In 1937 Weston received a Guggenheim Fellowship, the first ever given to a photographer. In the mid-1940s his career slowed when he developed Parkinson’s syndrome.

17973,Frank Mackey,Male,20 March 1852,,, Great Britain,GBR,"Frank Mackey founded the financial services company Household Finance in 1878. The company still exists as of 2015, but later became known as HSBC. His father, Joe Mackey, was a prominent attorney and banker and founded the Reedsburg Bank, the oldest bank in the city. After graduating from Beloit College, Frank also became an attorney and for a while worked as a cashier of the newly opened Reedsburg Bank. Having bigger ambitions, the young Mackey headed to California to make his fortune but returned broke and went to work back in the bank. After the family moved to Minneapolis, Mackey was involved in some shrewd financial investments at home, in Mexico and in England and he soon became a millionaire. Frank Mackey became a wealthy man from Household Finance and this gave him time to indulge in his hobby of polo playing. He had a strong international career in polo, winning such tournaments as the Paris International Tournament, Bledisloe Warwickshire Cup, Cirencester Challenge, and County Cups in England. He donated many trophies for polo tournaments, especially in California and Paris. Mackey died at the Leamington Hotel in Minneapolis, which he built in 1911 and was in its day, one of the finest hotels in America. Presidents like Ronald Reagan and Dwight D. Eisenhower stayed there, as did show business personalities Duke Ellington and The Beatles. The hotel was named after the Warwickshire town in England where Mackey spent his summer months for many years. It was said of him that he “lived a charmed life” but when he became terminally ill, he lost that charm by taking his own life. Before his suicide, he had bequeathed his entire fortune to his last wife Olga, nearly 40 years younger than him. Upon re-marrying she gave birth to her first child, Spanish bob pilot Fons de Portago, who took part in the Winter Games in 1956 and in Formula 1 races as well. Although Mackey was a US national all his life, at the 1900 Paris Olympics he played for Foxhunters Hurlingham, a British polo club.","Listed in Olympians Who Committed Suicide (Committed suicide, shot himself while suffering from a terminal illness.)"

He joined the British Army at the age of 17 and did not make his international début until 1982 when he was already 24-years-old. As a 400 runner he was never quite able to compete at the very highest level as an individual but was an invaluable member of the 4×400 relay team through his career. He was a member of the team that won the silver medal at the Los Angeles Olympics, the European Championship winning team of 1990 and England’s Commonwealth Games gold medal team also in 1990. In 1987 he decided to take up the 400 intermediate hurdles and, in his first season in the event, reached the World Championship final. Akabusi placed sixth in the Olympic final in 1988 then won the double of Commonwealth Games and European Championships in 1990. The latter championship was won in 47.92 seconds which handed him the British record which had stood since the 1968 Olympics. He again broke the record in placing third at the 1991 World Championships and for a third time when he finished in the same position at the 1992 Olympic Games. The 1991 World Championship was also the setting for probably his most memorable performance. With Great Britain trailing the USA at the start of the final leg of 4×400 relay, Akabusi was matched against newly crowned world 400 m champion Antonio Pettigrew. The American led for 350 metres but Akabusi kept close behind before pulling out to overtake Pettigrew and record one of the biggest upsets in the history of the championships. The Americans took revenge at the 1992 Olympics but Akabusi’s team did enough to win the bronze medal. A popular and ebullient presence on the athletics scene, he retired in 1993 and pursued a career as a television presenter and motivational speaker.

68693,Winnie Jordan,Female,15 March 1920,171.0,58, Great Britain,GBR,"Winner of many Midland Counties women’s titles, Winnie Jordan (formerly Jeffrey) won six individual WAAA titles. She was the 100 metre champion in 1937, 1945, and 1947-48, and the 200 metre and 440 yard champion in 1945, when she also helped her club, Birchfield Harriers, to the 660 yard relay title. Jordan was also runner up in the 100 in 1946 and the 200 in 1946 and 1947. The year after winning her first WAAA title, Jeffrey travelled to Australia to compete in the 1938 Empire Games, but it was a journey she would never forget. As one of five British 17-year-old girls on board the ship when it docked at Adelaide, they were not allowed to leave the ship immediately due to an outbreak of infantile paralysis (polio). The other girls also quarantined were Dorothy Odam, Lorna Frampton, Joyce Harrowby and Margaret Jeffrey (no relative). Eventually they left the ship, and Winnie Jeffrey won a silver medal in the 660 yard relay, and bronze in the 4 x 110 relay. She also competed in the individual 100, when she was involved in a bizarre event. Originally placed fourth in her heat, Jeffrey missed out on a place in the semi-final. The judges, however, realized their mistake and she was placed third, and thus qualified for the semi. She was unaware of events, and despite trackside appeals for her to come to the start for her semi-final, she could not be found and was therefore declared a non-starter. Jordan’s next appearance in a major international event was a much happier one. She won two silver medals at the 1946 European Championships in the 100 and 200 metres. In the 4 x 100 relay, along with Sylvia Cheesman, Maureen Gardner and Joyce Judd, she finished fourth.

In the latter, she set a Japanese record in 1938. After the war, she turned to discus throw and shot put.

He was therefore able to participate in the trials for what would become Canada’s first truly national amateur lacrosse delegation and was selected not only to travel with them to the 1908 Summer Olympics, but to act as a captain. The squad arrived in London six weeks early, but eventually defeated the British team, their only opponents, 14-10 and secured a gold medal. His amateur status also meant, however, that he had to work as a businessman outside of lacrosse, and he his presence on the team was at times sporadic. Work pressures eventually led him to announce his retirement in May of 1909. In 1912, however, he returned to the Shamrocks when the National Lacrosse Union voted to reinstate the role of the field captain, and the Shamrocks’ president refused to take on the role himself. He even played in one more game with the team in July 1915 and scored a goal. Shortly thereafter he left the sport for over a decade, but by the late 1920s he had renewed his interest and began to work to raise its popularity. He also served as the coach of Montreal’s St. Willbrord lacrosse team before taking up that role with the professional Montreal Maroons in the early 1930s.

He earned his nickname, Ace, after a newspaper headline declared “City ace triumphs in Province Cup” after one of his many victories. He won his first provincial title, the British Columbia Junior, in 1939, and would follow it up with four senior B.C. titles and two national championships. In 1946 he founded Ace’s Cycles in Vancouver, a business that he ran for over 60 years. He began to compete internationally for Canada in 1948 and attended that year’s Summer Olympics in London, placing 15th out of 21 competitors in the 1000 m time trial, and also participated in the individual and team road races, as well as the 4000 m team pursuit. Two years later he placed eighth in the road race, ninth in the 1000 m sprint, 15th in the track time trail, and competed in the 10 miles scratch at the 1950 British Empire Games while simultaneously managing and coaching the cycling squad. He improved upon this feat four years later when the British Empire and Commonwealth Games came to his hometown of Vancouver. Not only did he help establish a cycling track and organize the cycling events, but he captained the Canadian team and placed 4th in the 10 miles scratch event. As the automobile began to overshadow the bicycle, Atkinson’s local fame grew as he worked to preserve his passion in Vancouver by organizing events through the late 1950s and early 1960s. His efforts culminated in the presidency of the Vancouver Bicycle Club in 1962. Also active as a mentor, he was selected to coach the Canadian cycling team at the 1967 Pan American Games and the British squad at the 1982 Canada Championships. He continued cycling up until a few years before his death at the age of 88, and kept busy by documenting the history of cycling in British Columbia. He was inducted into the B.C. Sports Hall of Fame in 1997 as a builder, received the Queen Elizabeth II Golden Jubilee Medal for his contributions to Canada in 2002, and was honored with a British Columbia Community Achievement Award in 2006.

His career before 1995 was not unsuccessful as Edwards had won the World Cup in 1989, a Commonwealth Games silver medal in 1990 and, after reversing his decision on Sunday competition, a bronze medal at the 1993 World Championships, but it paled in comparison to what happened in 1995. He had shown early season form by breaking the national record but that didn’t prepare anyone for what was to occur next. At the European Cup in France Edwards produced the two longest, albeit wind-assisted, leaps in history and jumped nearly a quarter-metre further than any previous jump and 46 cm more than the official world record. Over the next few weeks he broke or equaled the British record four times then put a centimeter on Willie Banks’ world record at a meeting in Spain. At the Worlds in Göteborg his first leap was 18.16 m which marked the first legal 18 m jump and later in the competition he broke the world record again with 18.29 metres, the first ever mark beyond the Imperial barrier of 60 feet, and at the end of 2011 this world record has stood for 16 years, and remains the only jump ever over 60 feet. As world champion Edwards was now hot favourite for the 1996 Olympic title but in Atlanta his position as world #1 was usurped by American Kenny Harrison who chose the Olympic Final to became the second man to better 18 metres. Between the Atlanta and Sydney Olympics Edwards maintained his position as one of the world’s jumpers and won a silver and a bronze at the two World Championships in this period and was also European Champion in 1998. He finally became Olympic champion in the fourth appearance at the Games in 2000. While his jumps at Sydney did not approach those at Göteborg or Atlanta he was a clear winner of the event. He regained the world title in 2001 then won his first Commonwealth Games gold medal, at the age of 36, in 2002 but could only finish third at that year’s European Championships. He was expected to compete at a fifth Olympics in 2004 but elected to retire after a poor performance at the 2003 World Championships. Edwards joined the BBC as a member of its’ athletics presentation team also fronted some of the company’s religious broadcasting. In 2007 he stood down from his role on the TV programme “Songs of Praise” due to what was described as a “crisis of faith” although he continued in his role as a track and field commentator. A graduate in physics from Durham University, Edwards was voted Britain’s Sports Personality of the Year, L’Équipe’s International Champion of Champions and the UPI Athlete of the Year in 1995.

Upon his return to Ontario in 1953 he joined the Kitchener-Waterloo Dutchmen and won an Allan Cup, the senior level version of the Memorial Cup, with the team in 1955. It was this victory that made them Canada’s representatives in ice hockey at the 1956 Winter Olympics and Scholes took the trip with them to Cortina d’Ampezzo, Italy. He cut his head during practice a day prior to the commencement of the tournament, an injury that required stitches, but nevertheless played in all eight matches, scored five goals, and came home with a bronze medal. Back in Canada he spent one more season with the Dutchmen prior to transferring to the Windsor Bulldogs in 1957. After only ten games with the team he retired from active play.

He was also entered in the 1932 Olympics, oddly in the 50 km walk, although he did not compete. Koski’s two biggest victories in the United States were the 1929 Shepard Shores Providence-to-Boston race, a 44-mile ultramarathon, and the 1930 AAU Marathon on Staten Island. In that 1930 AAU race he recorded a time of 2-25:21.2, better than the marathon world best at the time, although it was felt that the course was short. Koski raced multiple times at the Boston Marathon but never quite won it. He placed second in 1927 to Clarence DeMar and 1929 (to John Miles (CAN)), and third in 1930 and 1931. At the AAU Championships he was also runner-up in 1927 (also to DeMar) and 1931 and finished fifth in 1925, as he also did at the 1934 Boston Marathon.

Initially a singles skater, Ovsyannikov switched to ice dance at the age of 10. He was first partnered with Maria Orlova, and they won the bronze medal at the 1988 World Junior Championships. He later formed a partnership with Yelena Kustarova and they won bronze medals at the 1992 Grand Prix International de Paris and the 1993 Nations Cup. In mid-94, Ovsyannikov teamed up with Anzhelika Krylova and together they became one of the top ice dance couples in the late 1990s, overshadowed only by Pasha Grishchuk and Yevgeny Platov. Krylova/Ovsyannikov won Olympic silver in 1998 (behind Grishchuk and Platov), were World Champions in 1998 and 1999 (Grishchuk and Platov were absent), European Champions in 1999, won silvers at the 1996 and 1997 World and 1996-98 European Championships (behind Grishchuk and Platov) and a bronze at the 1995 European Championships. Ovsyannikov and Krylova were planning to compete also in 2000 and had prepared programs and costumes, however, doctors advised Krylova to retire due to a risk of paralysis stemming from her back problem. So they turned to the much less demanding and more remunerative professional skating.

78533,Bob Hayes,Male,20 December 1942,183.0,86, United States,USA,"Bob Hayes is arguably the fastest sprinter of all time before the Usain Bolt era. During his four years at Florida A&M, Hayes lost only two of 62 finals at 100y or 100m. At 100m he had a best time of 10.06, which he clocked in the Olympic final on a cinder track after running a wind-assisted 9.91 in the semi-finals. Hayes was the first runner to run 100y in 9.1, and the first man to better six seconds for 60y indoors. Hayes won the AAU 100y for three straight years starting in 1962 and the NCAA 200m in 1964. From 1962-64 he won 49 consecutive races over 100 yards or 100 metres. His anchor leg in the 1964 Olympic relay, making up a four-meter deficit, was a fitting climax to a truly brilliant career. Estimates of his time range as low as 8.6 for the 100 meter leg, with an estimated 100y time of 7.7 seconds. The relay was Hayes’ final track race and upon his return home, he signed a pro football contract with the Dallas Cowboys. As a wide receiver and punt returner he became one of the great players of the game and should be credited with revolutionizing pass defense. Man-to-man coverage was woefully inadequate in coping with his speed, and it ushered in the era of zone defense in pass coverage. Hayes played pro football for 11 years – 10 with Dallas and a final one with the San Francisco 49ers. He finished with 371 receptions, and a career average of 20.0 yards/catch, one of only 6 NFLers to average 20 or more yards per catch for a career. He led the NFL in 1965 and 1971 in yards/catch and in 1968 with average punt return yardage and his career average of 11.1 yds per punt return is 19th all-time in the NFL, through 2016. Through 2016, Hayes is the only athlete to possess both an Olympic gold medal and a NFL Super Bowl ring (1972). Unfortunately in later years he ran into trouble with the law and served an eleven month jail term for possession and trafficking in illegal drugs.

He was Canadian champion in the event in 1906, which led to his selection to represent his country at the 1906 Intercalated Olympic Games. His pole was lost during the journey to Athens, however, and the replacement given to him by Greek officials broke and destroyed his confidence; he finished joint-10th and last, alongside Bert Kerrigan of the United States. He also competed in the “athletic pentathlum”, an event meant to imitate the events of the Ancient Greek pentathlon, and was seventh after four disciplines, one position shy of qualifying for the final. Graduating from the University of Toronto in 1907, he continued to compete as a member of the Toronto West End YMCA and, in 1908, won the Canadian, British, and Amateur Athletic Union pole vault titles. He was then sent to represent Canada at the 1908 Summer Olympics, also serving as the nation’s flagbearer in the Opening Ceremony, and came home with a bronze medal, shared with Bruno Söderström of Sweden and Clare Jacobs of the United States, after jumping 11-9 (3.58). Prior to World War I Archibald worked as prospector and remained athletically active, at one point holding the Canadian record for the shot put with 38-4 (11.68). Heavily involved with the YMCA, in 1915 he was sent overseas to direct recreation and sports programs for the soldiers. Upon his return he worked in the sports department of The Ottawa Journal, received a patent on a design for military equipment, served on Ontario’s provincial Athletic Commission, and, as President of the club, helped the Ottawa Amateur Athletic Federation open a sporting store. In 1924 he established a boy’s summer camp near Lake Wanapitei, Sudbury and, during World War II, once again worked through the YMCA for the war effort, this time in Canada.

At the 1900 Paris Olympics, he won a silver medal in eights rowing with the Royal Club Nautique de Gand crew. He left school after the sixth year to help his father run his gymnastics equipment manufacturing business. By 1903, Verdonck was leader of the new gymnastics and weapons society “Ganda”, which he labeled “Higher People’s School for Physical Education” and which achieved numerous national and international successes. At age 30, Verdonck studied physical education at the Institut supérieur d’Education physique of the University of Ghent (RUG), and in 1920 obtained his doctorate. Verdonck taught at the Royal Athenea of Antwerp and Bruges and at the Rijks Secondary Normal School in Ghent. In 1925 he was appointed as lecturer, and in 1939, a professor at the Medical Faculty of the Higher Institute for Physical Education in Gent teaching “Gymnastics and esthetics of movements” as well as “Play and sport.” In 1932, “Ganda” was temporarily excluded from the Belgian Catholic Gymnastics Union because of his progressive approach towards women’s gymnastics. In 1936, his portfolio was amended by “Special methods of physical education.” Verdonck was a fervent Flamingan and in 1913 proposed a Flemish-Walloon separation in the Catholic Gymnastics Union. Due to his Flemish patriotism and alleged sympathies for Germany, Verdonck was dismissed as a professor after World War II. He was reinstated in 1951 and given emeritus status, retroactive to 1949. His entry in the Art Competitions, a 78-page essay, was published in 1927 under the title Éducation esthétique populaire et éducation physique (Popular Aesthetic Education and Physical Education).",Brother of Julien Verdonck

He finished third in the team foil and equal fifth in the individual at Melbourne in 1956, while four years later in Rome he was fourth in the team competition, and then seventh at Tokyo in 1964. Gyuricza won ten World Championship medals, including two golds, and in 1955 was Hungary’s first individual world foil champion. A sports medical examination in 1966 found a patch on Gyuricza’s right lung, which was diagnosed as lung cancer and he underwent surgery. After the operation, with only half a lung, he fought for the silver-medal winning team at the World Championships in Moscow that year, before retiring from competition. In 1968, he graduated as a teacher of Physical Education at TF (College of Physical Education). Gyuricza became a fencing specialist in 1970, then a fencing master and, from 1977, he was a master coach working for BHSE, BVSC and OSC. His pupils included the three-time world champion and Olympic silver medallist Ildikó Farkasinszky-Bóbis, as well as and Olympic runner-up, Magda Maros. In the mid-1990s, Gyuricza became restricted in movement when he was paralysed down one side due to a vasospasm, and in 2020 he had an accident in his flat and was hospitalized, but his life unfortunately could not be saved, and he died a few days later.","Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the Summer Universiade (3–1–0 1961 Sofia FEN gold: foil team and sabre team; 1963 Porto Alegre FEN gold: sabre team, silver: foil team) Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the World Fencing Championships (2–5–3 1953 Bruxelles bronze: foil team; 1954 Luxembourg bronze: foil team; 1955 Roma gold: foil, silver: foil team; 1957 Paris gold: foil team; 1959 Budapest bronze: foil team; 1961 Torino silver: foil team; 1962 Buenos Aires silver: foil and foil team; 1966 Moskva silver: foil team)"

Craig was a star goalie at Boston University before he made the Olympic team, and he was one of the primary reasons the United States won the 1980 gold medal. After the final game, the television cameras caught him on the ice, with an American flag draped over his shoulders, plaintively looking into the stands, and asking, “Where’s my father?”, hoping to share the moment with him. He quickly signed with the Atlanta Flames and he (and his father) made several television commercials. It seemed Jim Craig had it all. But hard times hit Craig. First, he had difficulty as a pro netminder and suffered some bad games. Then he was beset by a succession of injuries which hampered a comeback. He was eventually traded to his hometown Boston Bruins. With the Bruins, however, injuries continued to haunt him, and he was shipped down to the minor leagues. He played part of one seasons with the Bruins, spent a year with the Erie Blades of the AHL, again played for the US National Team in 1983, and finished his career in 1983-84, playing mostly in the CHL with the Salt Lake Golden Eagles, and a few games with the Minnesota North Stars. He later became a motivational speaker.","Torchbearer within the Olympic Stadium at the Opening Ceremony of the 2002 Winter Olympics (Lit flame) Listed in Olympians Who Were Named Sports Illustrated's Sportsman of the Year (1980 USA Ice Hockey Gold Medal Team, 1980 Sports Illustrated Sportsman of the Year)"

Burghley was Britain’s leading all-round hurdler and was also an outstanding relay runner on the flat. At one time, he was the British record holder in all three hurdle events and the 4×400 metre relay. In the high hurdles he was the first Britain to break the 15-seconds barrier, won three AAA titles, competed in three Olympic Games and was a gold medalist at the 1930 Empire Games. In the 1930 British Empire Games 120 yard hurdles he won the gold medal. As a 220 yard hurdler he twice set a British record and his 1927 time of 24.7 seconds was not beaten until 1950. He was at his best in the 400 yard/400 metre hurdles winning an Olympic gold medal in 1928, setting one world and seven British records and winning five AAA titles and the gold medal at the 1930 Empire Games. He also won a relay gold medal at the Empire Games (with Roger Leigh-Wood and the non-Olympians Stuart Townend and Kenneth Brangwin) but his finest performance in this event came in the 1932 Olympic Games when he contributed a 46.7 second stage on the British team which won the silver medals with a new European record of 3:11.2 seconds. Earlier in the Games, Burghley had finished fifth in the 110 metre hurdles and fourth in the 400 metre hurdles with his fast ever time of 52.2 seconds. Burghley’s one world record came at the 1927 AAA Championships where he ran 54.2 seconds for the 440 yards hurdles, and although the record was reduced to 52.6 seconds on the same day by the American Johnny Gibson in Nebraska, Burghley’s performance was accomplished first in absolute time and his name was added to the roll of world record holders. Burghley and Gibson had, in fact, met earlier in the year at Penn Relays with the American winning by half a yard. Later it was found that Gibson was ineligible to compete in this particular collegiate race and Burghley was declared the winner. Burghley entered Parliament in 1931 as a member for the Peterborough and in 1943, on his appointment as the Governor for Bermuda, he resigned from the House. He also gave many years distinguished service to the Olympic movement and to the sport of track & field. In 1933, at the age of 28, he became a member of the International Olympic Committee and in 1936 he was elected President of the Amateur Athletic Association and Chairman of the British Olympic Association. Ten years later he became President of the International amateur Athletic Federation and in 1948 he served as Chairman of the Organizing Committee for the Olympic Games. He failed in a bid for the IOC presidency in 1952 and 1964, but from 1952 to 1966 he served as Vice-President of the IOC. In 1929 he married Lady Maria Theresa Montague-Douglas-Scott, the daughter of the Duke of Buccleuch, and after their marriage dissolved in 1946 he married Mrs. Diana Forbes.

In 1913 IAAF decided that the Olympic Games would serve as the World Championships for athletics, thus the Olympic champions from 1920-80 were also considered as World Champions. But in the late 1960s the desire of many IAAF members to have their own World Championships began to grow and it culminated in the mid-70s, when the IOC dropped the 50 km walk from the Olympic Program. The IAAF responded by setting up their own World Championship in the 50 km walk, which was held in Malmö, Sweden, and was won by Soldatenko. Soldatenko had taken up race walking in 1962 and was selected for the Soviet national team in 1967. Besides his World title, Soldatenko won a 50 km walk silver at the 1972 Olympics and was the 1971 European 50 km walk champion. He also won a 50 km walk silver at the 1978 Europeans and bronze at the 1969 Europeans, placing fifth at the 1974 meet. Soldatenko won silver in the 50K walk at the 1970 IAAF World Race Walking Cup.

Bissett retired from active competition following the Games, although he remained athletically active for many years as a pitcher in club-level baseball.

Hill-Lowe won the 1897 Crystal Palace meeting, and then won the first gross score prize at that year’s Grand National Meeting. She won the same prize at the 1899 Northern Championships and followed that with a third best score at the 1902 Grand National Meeting. At the 1906 meeting, she won the coveted Silver Challenge Belt for the most hits, and also had the second highest score behind the winner Alice Legh. Legh did not compete in the London Olympics, preferring to concentrate on winning another national title instead. Her omission probably paved the way for Hill-Lowe to capture the bronze medal in the Double National Round at White City behind Quennie Newall and Lottie Dod, and therefore had the honour of becoming the first Irish woman to win an Olympic medal. Legh subsequently justified not taking part in the Olympics by winning her seventh consecutive UK title at Oxford the following week, with Hill-Lowe finishing third. Hill-Lowe was the youngest of five daughters and three sons of William Ruxton, a Irish landowner, local magistrate, and deputy-lieutenant. She moved to South Wales in her infancy and spent a large part of her life in that area. She married Royal Navy commander Arthur Hill-Lowe in 1891. He too was a fine archer and the pair competed together in the Grand National Archery Meeting at the turn of the 20th century. Arthur died in 1910, by which time Beatrice had given up competitive archery. The following year Beatrice married lieutenant-colonel Wycliffe Thompson.",

As a schoolboy at Repton, Harold won the 100 yards and the long jump at the 1918 Public Schools championships and then went up to Caius College, Cambridge, where during his four years’ residence he won a total of eight events in the annual match against Oxford. During his years at Cambridge, Abrahams had his first experience of international competition and his début, in the 1920 triangular match between Ireland and Scotland, saw him win the 220 yards. The following month he competed, without success, in the Antwerp Olympics. After a successful tour of America with the combined Oxford & Cambridge team in 1921, Abrahams confined himself to the domestic scene for the next two seasons and in 1923 set an English long jump record of 23-8¼ in (7.19) before improving the record to 23-8¾ (7.23) with his first victory at the AAA Championships. Throughout the winter of 1923-24 Abrahams trained assiduously under the eye of the brilliant coach Sam Mussabini – their relationship was one of the many fascinating themes of the award-winning film Chariots of Fire. Reward for a winter of hard work came early in 1924 when Abrahams ran a wind-assisted 9.6 seconds for 100 yards and again improved the English long jump record to 24-2½ (7.38). After an interval of two weeks, he won the 100 yards and long jump at the AAA Championships and then went to Paris for the Olympic Games. Following a near-disaster at the start of the semi-finals for the 100 metres, he ran magnificently in the final to beat the American Jackson Scholz by two feet. His time was officially given as 10.6 seconds although the electric timer showed no more than 10.52 seconds. In Paris, Abrahams also reached the final of the 200 metres and was a member of the relay team that ran progressively faster at each outing before taking the silver medals with a time of 41.2 seconds, which was to remain a British record for 28 years. There were no presentation ceremonies at the Paris Olympics and one month after the Games, Abraham received his medals through the mail; but as the French authorities had not put sufficient stamps on the package he had to pay the excess positive himself! Abrahams had certainly not fulfilled his potential, particularly as a long jumper, when a severe leg injury put an end to his active career in May 1925, but he went on to render unsurpassed service to the sport as an administrator, journalist, broadcaster, historian and statistician. He was the athletic correspondent of the Sunday Times from 1925 to 1967, a founder member of the Association of Track & Field Statisticians, and for many years a commentator for BBC radio. He became a member of the AAA General Committee in 1926, being appointed Secretary in 1931 and President in 1976. He was the first Secretary of the International Board, which was the forerunner of the British Amateur Athletic Board, and in 1963 he was appointed Chairman of the BAAB after serving as Treasurer for 21 year. Abrahams was not universally popular within the sport and his sometimes brusque manner became rather more pronounced in his later years, but many people can bear witness to the gentler and more generous side of is character. Somewhere within the differing aspects of his personality probably lies the answer to the question as to why he never received any official recognition for the enormous amount of voluntary work he undertook on behalf of the sport. He was, however, awarded the CBE in 1957 as Secretary of the National Parks Commission, which he joined after practicing as a barrister for 13 years.

He also competed in the 800 metres – not among his specialties – and was again eliminated in the first round. After being in second on the Canadian lists for the three miles in 1929, he rose to the top of the list again in 1930, this time in the one mile, and just missed the podium in fourth in that event at the 1930 British Empire Games. During much of his career, Walter was a student at Marquette University in Wisconsin, where he captained the varsity track team and helped establish a collegiate relay record. He retired from active competition after 1930 and graduated from Marquette with a law degree in 1933. Having been known from his high school days as an award-winning orator, he first set up practice in Milwaukee, then moved to Sheboygan in 1935, where he spent the rest of his life as a lawyer and community leader.

After the Japanese invasion of Manchuria in 1931, the government of the newly established puppet state of Manchukuo decided to send Liu Changchun and middle and long distance runner Yu Xiwei to the 1932 Los Angeles Olympics. But Liu refused to represent Manchukuo and China had no plans to send a team. A general donated 8,000 $ for travel expenses and the director of the Northeastern University, who was also director of the National Sports Association, urged the Organizing Committee of the Games to allow for an emergency entry. Liu arrived just one day before the opening ceremony and only two days before his first heat. He was obviously handicapped by the three weeks at sea and did not advance from the heats in either event. Four years later, he was a member of the first official Chinese team for the 1936 Berlin Olympics but was eliminated in the heats after arriving late again. Due to the ongoing turmoils after the end of the Chinese Empire, national championships could only be held in 1930, 1933 and 1935. Liu Changchun claimed the national title in the 100 m at all three competitions, additionally in the 200 m in 1930 and 1933, and in the 400 m in 1930. In 1933 he set national records in the 100 and 200 m dash, which were not to be broken for more than 20 years. After Liu Changchun retired from competition, he served as a lecturer and associate professor at various universities before he started a long career at the Dalian Institute of Technology (today Dalian University of Technology) in 1950. During the Cultural Revolution, he was forced to work on a farm near Dalian, but was later rehabilitated.

He won the sprint silver medal at the 1974 European Junior Championships and in 1975, was the senior Italian sprint champion, fourth in the team pursuit at the world championships, and was a gold medal winner at the Mediterranean Games. Saronni also competed in the team pursuit at the 1976 Montréal Olympics, where Italy was eliminated by the Soviet Union in the quarter-finals. Saronni turned professional after the Olympics when still only 19-years-of-age, but his years did not reflect his tremendous talent and he won some prestigious races like the Trofeo Pantalica, Tour of Sicily, Tre Valli Varesine, Tour of Veneto, Tour of Friuli, as well as three criteriums. In 1979, having won three stages in the Giro d’Italia the previous year, Saronni won three more, and was the overall winner beating Francesco Moser in what heralded the start of another great cycling rivalry, like those of Alfredo Binda/Learco Guerra and Fausto Coppi/Gino Bartali. In 1980, Saronni’s victories included the Flèche Wallonne and the Italian Professional Road Race Championship. Perhaps the greatest period of his career was in 1982 when he won, amongst others, the Tour of Sardinia, Milano-Torino, Tirreno-Adriatico stage race, Tour of Trentino, Tour de Suisse, Coppa Agostoni and, at Goodwood, England, the World Professional Road Race Championships, defeating American Greg LeMond and Irishman Sean Kelly into second and third place. His final sprint was so impressive that it was nicknamed “The Gunshot of Goodwood”. In the final part of the season he won another classic, the Tour of Lombardy. The 1983 season saw continued success for Saronni and, in addition to winning the Milano-San Remo, he won his second Giro d’Italia. However, his career started to decline after that. He won two stages in the Tour of Norway in 1984 and a further two stages in the 1985 Giro, won by Bernard Hinault, taking his career total to 24. There was some improvement in the fortunes of Saronni in 1986 when he finished second overall to Roberto Visentini in the Giro, and won a bronze medal at the World Road Race Championships in Colorado Springs. A few minor successes followed, and he went on to compete in his 11th World Championship in 1988, but Saronni decided to call it a day in 1990 and retired from competitive racing. He became team manager of, firstly, the Ceramiche Panaria-Vinavil team, and then the Lampre team and went on to manage two Giro winners, with Pavel Tonkov (1996) and Gilberto Simoni (2001).",Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the Mediterranean Games (1–0–0 1975 Al-Jaza'ir CYC gold: team pursuit)

Since all his submitted works are drawings and sketches, they are probably on the market under different titles. Skeaping studied at Goldsmith’s College of Art, the Central School of Arts and Crafts and the Royal Academy Schools. Skeaping married the sculptor Barbara Hepworth, although their marriage ended in 1933. During World War II Skeaping was commissioned as an official war artist. After 1945 he lived in Mexico and later taught for some time at the Royal College of Art, and also exhibited widely. In 1959 he then moved to the French Camargue, where he spent the last decades of his life. Skeaping’s work concentrated on painting animals, in particular race horses, which he drew with an economy of line that caught the power of taut muscles and flowing manes of a galloping horse. Three of the best three known racehorses he sculptured were of the outstanding classic winners Mill Reef, Brigadier Gerard and Hyperion.",

It was a controversial choice at the time as Budd was South African and the country was then banned from the Olympics. However, Budd was a child running prodigy, bettering the world record for 5,000 metres in early 1984 at only 18-years-old, although it could not be officially recognized because of her citizenship. The Daily Mail, a British tabloid newspaper, encouraged Budd’s father to have her represent Great Britain in Los Angeles because her grandfather had British citizenship. This was the method by which she was added to the Great Britain team. At the Los Angeles Olympics Budd competed in the 3,000 metres where the favorite was US runner Mary Decker-Slaney. Just over four laps into the race, with Budd leading, Budd and Decker-Slaney collided, with Decker-Slaney falling to the ground with a hip injury and did not finish the race, in tears on the infield. Budd finished but placed seventh, the race eventually won by Romania’s Maricica Puică. Budd tried to apologize to Decker-Slaney, who was her idol, but Decker-Slaney blamed Budd for the incident and did not accept it, telling her not to bother. In 1985 Budd broke the 5,000 metre world record again, and this time it was recognized as a British citizen. She raced well over the next few years, winning the 1985 World Cross-Country Championships, but injuries limited her effectiveness in the later 1980s. In 1989 she returned to South Africa and represented them at the 1992 Barcelona Olympics but did not make the final of the 3,000 metres. After marriage, Budd-Pieterse moved to South Carolina in 2008 and raced marathons and ultramarathons. She ran several times at the Comrades Ultramarathon in South Africa and eventually moved back to South Africa in 2021. Personal Best: 3000 – 8:28.83 (1985).",

85521,Paul Enock,Male,9 July 1934,182.0,76, Canada,CAN,"Canadian speed skater Paul Enock was originally a competitive cyclist who found moderate success in his home country and at the 1958 British Empire and Commonwealth Games. In the latter he finished joint 18th in the 1km time trial, 12th in the 4000m individual pursuit, and outside of the medals in the 10 mile scratch race. He had always considered his cycling efforts to be training for a competitive speed skating career and, by the 1960s, he had begun living and studying in Norway and switched disciplines. In 1962 he unofficially bested the 3000m world record, allegedly while wearing his wife Eva’s nylon panties, after Eva ironed a hole through his woolen tights. This led to a rapid transition in the skating world from wool and cotton suits to ones made from artificial fibers and a subsequent improvement on many old records. Enock became ill with the flu shortly after this feat and missed most of the remainder of the season. In November 1962 he was involved in a car crash in Sweden that killed Eva and caused him serious injury. Although he broke several Canadian records during his slow return to top form over the following two years, he was not selected to represent Canada at the 1964 Winter Olympics. In 1967, however, he became the Canadian overall national champion and was then able to attend the 1968 Winter Olympics, where he finished 15th in the 10,000m event and 19th in the 5,000m tournament. He retired from active competition soon thereafter and was coach of the Canadian National Team during the late 1970s.

Coberger competed in the 1991 World Championships placing thirteenth in the combined event but it was in January 1992 that she made a breakthrough. That month saw a run of results which culminated in an FIS World Cup slalom win at Hinterstoder that lifted her from a relative unknown to being one of the Olympic slalom favourites. Coberger placed eighth on the first run of the slalom at Méribel but was quickest on the second run and became the first representative from a Southern Hemisphere country to win a Winter Olympic medal. Although she never again won a World Cup event her consistency earned second place in the slalom standings for the 2002-03 season. Her form dipped the next season and she suffered a disappointment at the 1994 Winter Games when she failed to finished the first run.

They were also runners-up at Wimbledon in doubles in 1901. Davis won the Intercollegiate Tennis Championships in 1899 while at Harvard, before there was an NCAA. In 1900 Davis helped develop the structure for the Davis Cup and donated the trophy that survives to this day. After Harvard, Davis earned a law degree at Washington University in St. Louis. He never practiced law, but instead entered politics, initially in St. Louis. He was city public parks commissioner from 1911-15, expanding sports facilities and creating the first municipal tennis courts in the United States.

In Milwaukee Schoenfeld continued his training in wrestling and fencing under Professor Robert Reuter and he became a naturalized US citizen in 1889. In the 1890s Schoenfeld worked as a physical instructor with the Young Men’s Christian Association (YMCA), Woodson Ray University and Lyceum Conservatory in Memphis, Tennessee. In 1898 Schoenfeld moved to New Orleans, Louisiana, where he took up the physical instructor’s position in the Southern Athletic Club, but soon moved over to the Young Men’s Gymnastics Club in the same city. As Schoenfeld worked as a physical instructor, he was not considered an amateur by the rules of the turn of 20th century, so we don’t find his name at the US amateur wrestling or fencing annals and he never took part in the US championships in those events. In 1900, Schoenfeld had a round trip to Europe and competed in many competitions there, including in many 1900 World’s Fair sporting competitions. The local newspaper, the New Orleans Times-Picayune, describes his participation at the World’s Fair sporting competitions (of which one part was the 1900 Olympics) as following: “It is unnecessary to review his trip to Europe and his participation in the world’s championship games, wherein he won three championships pitted against the world’s best athletes, and several second prizes, though in a half crippled condition. It will be recalled that the French government presented him with a magnificent bronze medallion, in tribute to his splendid swordsmanship, though he was debarred, through the unfounded pretext that his entry had arrived too late, from the sword contests. (In reality they were afraid of him.)” Colourful description, but if we look only the dry facts, his accomplishments at the World’s Fair were first in the professional shot put and second in both professional high and long jumps and his only true Olympic participation came in the master’s sabre tournament, where he lost in the first round. Schoenfeld probably also participated at the professional wrestling tournaments during the World’s Fair, but those results have not survived to our time. Back in the United States, Schoenfeld gained some fame as a professional wrestler, who wrestled bouts with such great turn-of-the-century professional wrestlers like Frank Gotch, Tom Jenkins and Tom Sharkey. He won several handicap bouts against Jenkins and Gotch and was always considered as a worthy opponent by them. Schoenfeld later worked as the athletic director of Young Men’s Gymnastic Club in New Orleans and also operated a private academy of fencing and physical culture for young ladies.",
