14581,Freddie Grubb,Male,27 May 1887,,, Great Britain,GBR,"Notice of Freddie Grubb’s ability was first posted when he finished second to Jack Bishop in the 24-hour race at Herne Hill in 1909, the first such race in Britain since 1896. Grubb, originally known as Fred but later widely called Freddie, won the Bath Road Club 100-mile time-trial in 1910, and by the end of the year was being labeled “the fastest cyclist in the world”. Between 1909 and 1913, Grubb set many un-paced records including the London to Brighton, and back, record of 5-09:41 in 1912. He also set the Irish 50- and 100-mile road records at 2-20:27 and 5-11:12 respectively. In Ireland, he also won the Irish 50-mile Championship three years in succession, 1910-12, and set a new record for the 102 miles (164 km) journey from Dublin to Belfast in 5-21:05. Grubb won the Anerley 12-hour time-trial at Liverpool in 1911, and the following year represented England at the Stockholm Olympics. He returned with two silver medals as runner-up in both the individual and team road race. Less than a couple of months after the Games, Grubb turned professional. He set the British one-hour record (something he had also done as an amateur), but had very little success after turning to the paid ranks of the sport. He made history in 1914, however, as the first Englishman to compete in a major Tour, when he was part of the Atala team in the Giro d’Italia. Atala had won the race in 1909-10 and 1912, but in 1914 pulled out en masse at the end of the first stage, thus making Grubb’s one and only appearance in a major Tour a brief one. Grubb never liked the Continental style of racing, calling his fellow riders “dirty”, so he returned to England. As races were limited for professionals in those days, however, he effectively ended his racing career. With financial backing from his fellow Olympian Charlie Davey, Grubb started manufacturing lightweight cycles, “Freddie Grubb Cycles” just before World War I. When the War broke out, Grubb originally worked in a London munitions factory before joining the Navy. At the time, he had been a committed vegetarian since 1907, hence his membership of the Vegetarian C & AC. When he returned to civilian life, however, he was no longer a vegetarian because the Navy’s menu never catered to non meat-eaters.",

At the age of 13 she won a silver medal in the 3000 m relay team event at the Canada Winter Olympics and set many provincial records as a junior over the next four years, a tenure that she capped off by winning bronze in the same event in 2003.

Like his older brother Reg, Waters was a member of the South London Road Club. Having finished third behind Reg Harris in the national quarter-mile championship and second to Tommy Godwin in the London Area NCU 5-mile grass championship, he had some notable successes in the 1948 Olympic year. These included winning a 60-lap Madison race at Coventry with Dave Ricketts, in which they beat off strong Dutch and Danish opposition and, also at Coventry, Waters beat Reg Harris into third place in a 5-mile scratch race, Waters, Ricketts, Alan Geldard and Tommy Godwin had just 10 days to prepare together before the team pursuit at the 1948 Olympics. Their preparations were thrown into further disarray when manager Bill Bailey walked out on the eve of the Games, over star rider Reg Harris’s refusal to train with the rest of the squad. The replacement coach, Harry Ryan, a former Olympic tandem gold medalist, knew nothing about pursuit riding, and this meant the British four had to work out a strategy for themselves, and it took them to a bronze medal. In 1950 Waters lost to Alan Bannister in final of the NCU 1000 yards sprint championship, but did win the half-mile Scottish Grass Championship at the Edinburgh Highland Games. It was one of the last major honours of his career.",

He revolutionized inline speed skating with his technique of a double-push, called the DP, which is now standard at world-class levels. After watching fellow inline skater Derek Parra win two medals at the 2002 Winter Olympics, Hedrick decided to switch to ice speed skating. After only four months on ice, Hedrick placed fifth in the 5,000 at the 2003 World Single Distance Championship, and after only two years of skating, he won the World Allround title in 2004 with a world record samalog of 150.478, and was awarded the Oscar Mathisen Statuette for 2004, given to the top speed skater performace in the world for the year. Between then and the Torino Olympics, Hedrick established himself among the best long-distance skaters in the world, setting world records in the 1,500, 5,000, and 10K in November-December 2005. He entered the 2006 Winter Olympics with chances to win medals in all three events as well as the new team pursuit, and Hedrick predicted he would equal Eric Heiden’s five gold medals, adding the 1,000. The Torino Olympics started out well for Hedrick, as he won the 5,000 metres, but he won no further gold medals, although he did win a bronze in the 1,500 and silver in the 10K. But in the team pursuit, Hedrick and teammate Shani Davis got into a controversy when Davis elected not to compete, stating that it would interfere with his own best event, the 1,000, in which he would win the gold medal. Without Davis, the US pursuit team struggled and placed only sixth. Hedrick continues to speed skate internationally, but not quite as successfully, placing fourth at the 2008 World Allround.

He was primarily a wood sculptor, but sometimes devoted himself to painting. Above all, he was fascinated by the discovery of articles of daily use in a new design or a new form and became one of the leading artists in the field of non-traditional designs. In addition to furniture and furnishings, in which he avoided right angles and straight lines, he also developed complete interiors. Esherick was considered the most important US wood designer of his time but had few stylistic successors. He was an uncle of well-known architect Joseph Esherick (1914-98). In 1972 his home studio in Paoli was converted into the Wharton Esherick Museum outside of Valley Forge, Pennsylvania. In 1932, Wharton Esherick presented two woodcuts. The motif of Winter Play was 17 x 11 cm, the sheet 39 x 27 cm. “Hors concours”, possibly because it was created in 1927 prior to the previous Olympics, he showed Surf Fishing in the format 19 x 20 cm.",

In 1899 he was only playing in the Division III of the Manchester league, but the following year he was recruited by the famous Manchester Osborne Swim Club. He is traditionally listed as competing on the 1900 Olympic team, but this is most likely not the case. After being on the winning Manchester team for the 1901 ASA championships, Wilkinson moved to Hyde Seal SC in 1902. He captained the Hyde team for 22 years, leading them to nine ASA titles and a victory over Brussels in the “World Championship” at Paris in 1904. Wilkinson won two Olympic gold medals, captained the winning team at the 1912 Olympics and was a reserve for the 1920 and 1924 Olympic teams. He won a total of 24 caps for England between 1900 and 1922, captaining the team on four occasions. Wilkinson had been an enthusiastic swimmer since boyhood and as a 17-year-old he finished third in the 1896 500 yards world championship race when, although he was beaten by Jack Tyres and John Henry “Rob” Derbyshire, he succeeded in pushing the redoubtable Jack Jarvis back into fourth place. Although he never won an ASA title, Wilkinson often placed well at the championships, finishing second in the 1000 yards in 1898 and the 220 yards in 1901. Like a number of notable sportsmen of this time, he became a publican and was the landlord at the Wheatsheaf Hotel in Hyde for many years.",

He then went to India and worked for the Public Works Department before joining the Survey of India. He served in France 1915-19 where he was promoted to major, was wounded, mentioned in dispatches, and awarded the Distinguished Service Order (DSO). On his return to India in 1920 Morshead served with the Waziristan Field Force, and in 1921 was appointed deputy superintendent to the Survey of India. He was a Fellow of the Royal Geographical Society and went on two Everest Expeditions. The first was the 1921 reconnaissance expedition, and the second was the following year, when he reached around 25,000 feet (7,620m) before sickness and severe frostbite prevented him joining other members of the expedition who came within 1,800 feet (549m) of the summit. Upon return to India he had to have several digits removed surgically. Morshead was promoted to superintendent to the Survey in 1926, and in 1928 was promoted to lieutenant-colonel in the Royal Engineers. After all his gallantry and mountaineering exploits, Henry Morshead met an unfortunate end when he was murdered in Burma (now Myanmar). At 8am on the morning of 17 May 1931 he went for a ride on his pony. Later that day the alarm was raised that something was amiss when the pony returned home rider-less and bloodstained.

He then worked in Lausanne with Eugène-Édouard Monod until 1915, and together they won the gold medal in 1912 Olympic Architecture for their Building Plan of a Modern Stadium. They had already participated in an IOC-sponsored architectural competition in Paris in 1911 and won the first prize with a respective design. The “Terrain of a Modern Olympia” was planned for the Bay of Boiron, west of Monod’s birthplace Morges on Lake Geneva. The project consisted of two parts: one for field sports and one for water sports. The former included a stadium, a football field, and tennis courts; while the latter consisted of swimming pools, a marina, and a regatta course. The entire complex was complemented by a road of glory. Laverrière and Monod became friends with Pierre de Coubertin and followers of the Olympic Movement. They developed a theory for mutual inspiration of art and sport. The stadium was intended not only as the venue for sporting events, but also a stage for artistic and aesthetic performances. Over the next few years, they developed a second Olympic project for Vidy, a district of Lausanne. Laverrière mostly designed and built villas, banking and factory buildings but also bridges. He was also involved in interior design and furniture design. His best known buildings were the Reformation Memorial at Genève, the Railway Station at Lausanne, the cemetery “Bois-de-Vaux” at Montoie / Bourdonnette, the Bel-Air tower, the Chauderon bridge and the Botanic Garden. He constructed the Zenith Watch Factory in Zürich from 1917-26. Between 1929-42 he was professor of theoretical architecture at the ETH Zürich. In 1913 he helped found “L’Œuvre”, which published an identically named newspaper and was considered as a francophone equivalent to the Deutscher Werkbund. Laverrière was also a member of the Swiss Engineer and Architecture Federation and of the Bund Schweizer Architekten. In 1924, he was a member of the jury for architecture at the Paris Olympics.",

He had 18 World Cup victories, 10 in downhill, and won 4 gold, 11 silver and 1 bronze medal in the Winter Olympics or World Championships in the period from 1993-2005. The only male alpine skier with more international championships medals is his friend Kjetil André Aamodt. Kjus won six national titles, and was an excellent all-rounder, with international medals in all Alpine disciplines. His international breakthrough at the senior level came in 1993 when he was World Champion in combined at Morioka, Japan, although in 1990 he had won medals in all five events at the World Junior Championships. He again won the combined at the 1994 Lillehammmer Olympics, heading a Norwegian medal sweep. At the 1999 World Championships in Vail, Colorado, Kjus medalled in every event, winning giant slalom and Super-G, and taking silver in downhill, slalom and the combined, making him, through 2013, the only alpine skier to medal in all five events at an international championship. Kjus was twice the overall World Cup champion, in 1996 and 1999, and won four event seasonal World Cups, adding downhill and combined in 1999, and winning the combined in 1994 and 2001. In all he had 60 podiums in World Cup races. One of his most famous races came in the 1999 Lauberhorn slalom at Wengen when he caught a tip coming out of the gate, spun around and went through the first gate backwards, but corrected himself and still finished third in the race, a feat seen often on youtube. The “Dream Team” of Kjus and Aamodt ended their career after the 2006 Olympics, but just for fun Kjus made a comeback at the 2008 Norwegian Championships, winning a silver medal in downhill at the 1994 Olympic venue in Kvitfjell, Lillehammer. After his retirement Kjus became a very successful businessman, and in 2012 sold the rights to his brand Kjus to the Swiss firm LK Internatonal for 56 million Norwegian Kroner.","Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the World Alpine Ski Championships (3–8–0 1993 Morioka gold: combined; 1996 Sierra Nevada silver: combined; 1997 Sestriere silver: downhill, Super G, and giant slalom; 1999 Vail gold: Super G and giant slalom, silver: downhill, slalom, and combined; 2003 St. Moritz silver: combined) Listed in Olympic Alpine Skiers - Gold Medalists and World Champions; Same Discipline - Different Event (Combined: Olympic Gold - 1994, World Champion - 1993)"

He formed part of the team pursuit quartet that took the gold medal at Antwerpen, but the Italian victory was controversial. In the semi-finals, the Italians faced South Africa. While enjoying a clear lead, the finishing pistol was fired for the South Africans with half-a-lap to go, and they slowed down. Despite a protest, the Italians went on to the final. One of their British opponents, Albert White, dropped from the group. The Italians assumed he was trying to interfere with their changeovers, and went wide to avoid him, while a French cyclist ran onto the track to punch White. The British won the race narrowly, but this time the Italians filed a protest, which was eventually upheld. Carli later turned professional, and twice competed in the Giro d’Italia (1926, 1931), although he did not finish either time.

Between the 1984 and 1988 Olympics she married Al Joyner, gold medalist in the triple jump at the Los Angeles Olympics. In 1988, after setting a world record of 10.49 for 100 metres at the U.S. Olympic Trials, she won three golds and one silver medal at the Seoul Games. Victories in the 100 metres and 200 metres, in which she twice broke the world record (21.56 in the semis, and 21.34 in the final), were followed by a third gold in the sprint relay and a silver in the 4×400 metres relay. She had previously won a silver medal in the 200 metres in 1984, and at the World Championships, she also won a silver medal in 1987. Griffith Joyner was NCAA Champion over 200 metres in 1982 and 400 metres in 1983. The flamboyant outfits she wore on the track made her a darling of the media who gave her the nickname “Flo-Jo”.

37291,Hugh Edwards,Male,17 November 1906,,, Great Britain,GBR,"Hugh “Jumbo” Edwards went up to Christ Church College, Oxford from Westminster School and rowed in the Oxford boat as freshman in 1926 when his brother was also a member of the crew. Unfortunately, Edwards collapsed when the Dark Blues held a slight lead and Cambridge went on to win by five lengths. In 1927, Edwards was rusticated for failing his examinations and he then spent two years as a schoolmaster although he continued to row regularly with the London Rowing Club. While he was teaching, Edwards decided to follow his brother into the Royal Air Force and the only avenue open to him by which he could secure a permanent commission was to return to Oxford and obtain a University degree. So in 1930, Edwards went back to Oxford, took his degree and then joined the RAF the following year. During his second period at Oxford, he devoted more time to flying than to rowing and obtained Proctorial License No. 1 which enabled him to keep his private plane at the University. However, he was still good enough to command a place in the Oxford boat and five years after his first appearance he rowed again in the 1930 Boat Race. Referring to the 1930 race, Edwards later wrote, “I was incomparably the best oarsman in either crew” but apparently his Oxford colleagues could not match his talents as Cambridge won by two lengths. Later in 1930, Edwards was in the London Rowing Club crew that won the Grand and the Stewards’ at Henley and he then went to Canada for the British Empire Games where he won gold medals in the coxless fours and the eights. In 1931 he won three events at Henley – the Grand, the Stewards’ and the Goblets. At the 1932 Olympics he became only the second man in Olympic history to win two rowing gold medals on the same day. First he won the coxless pairs with Lewis Clive and then he was a member of the winning crew in the coxless fours, having been brought in as a late substitute for Thomas Tyler who contracted influenza after arriving in California. All these victories added up to a remarkable display of stamina for a man who had collapsed in the 1926 Boat Race. After being commissioned into the RAF in 1931, Edwards became a well-known racing pilot and, in his own plane, finished second in the King’s Cup of 1935. During the war, he served with Coastal Command, winning the AFC in 1943 and the DFC the following year. In 1943 his rowing ability literally saved his life. Being forced to ditch his Liberator off Land’s End he rowed a dinghy for four miles before getting clear of the minefield in which he had landed. He was the only survivor of his crew. Group Captain Edwards retired from RAF in 1946 and soon developed a reputation as an innovative coach. He advised his old University on a number of occasions, including 1959 when his son David was in the Oxford crew, and he also coached Britain’s Olympic eight in 1960. Both David and his brother John were members of the Welsh coxless four that won medals at both the 1958 and 1962 Commonwealth Games.","Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the British Empire/Commonwealth Games (2–0–0 1930 Hamilton ROW gold: coxless fours and eights (competed for England)) Listed in Olympians Who Competed in the Boat Race (1926 Oxford (lost), 1930 Oxford (lost))"

The following year she won both the AAU indoor and outdoor titles and repeated the double for the next three years, although she tied for the 1932 outdoor title with Babe Didrikson. She was destined to meet Didrikson again later in the season in a classic Olympic final. Both cleared 5-5 (1.65) for a new world record, and in the jump-off both were over at 5-5¾ (1.67), but the judges ruled that Didrikson had illegally dived over the bar and the gold medal went to Shiley. IAAF rules at the time prohibited world records being recognized if set in a jump-off, so both Shiley and Didrikson were credited with a new world record of 5-5 (1.65). Jean Shiley, who joined the Meadowbrook Club of Philadelphia after leaving school, also set an unofficial world record of 5-3½ (1.61) at Boston in April 1930. Personal Best: HJ – 1.65 (1932).",

In 1959 he became the Canadian Champion in the light-heavyweight division, but Quebec boycotted the trials for that year’s Pan-American Games after the Amateur Athletic Union of Canada moved them from Quebec to Winnipeg. After the trials went poorly, however, Lipari called the head of the AAU and presented his credentials, which earned him a trip to the tournament without any further demonstration. He placed first again at the next Canadian National Championships, which doubled as the trials for the 1960 Summer Olympics. Representing Canada at the Games in the light-heavyweight division, he placed 14th in a field of 24 competitors. Lipari had two more major stops in his international weightlifting career. In 1962 he participated in the World Championships, placing outside the medals, and in 1963 he represented Canada once more at the Pan-American Games, winning bronze in the light-heavyweight category and taking up the role of his nation’s flag-bearer.

Earlier that year, on 5 May 1912, he set an American record for 150 miles in 8-26:27. Kopsky later rode as a professional in six-day races, competing from 1913-23, in Chicago, New York, Boston, and Kansas City, competing in 35 six-days, and racing until he was 49. After retiring from racing, Kopsky worked as a steel worker, but also owned and operated a bicycle shop and helped engineer racing equipment. He started the North Hudson Wheelmen and the Belleville Bicycle Club, training many local riders in Northern Jersey. After World War II, Kopsky retired to Miami, living there until his death.

At the 1964 Olympics, Privalov’s skiing time was only 16th, but with clean shooting he rose to second place.

They had a squad of seven fighters and returned home with two gold, one silver and two bronze medals. Apart from the 1908 Games on home soil, it was, at the time, the biggest medal haul from a British team. Nicholls himself won the featherweight silver medal when he lost on a split decision to the Soviet Union’s Vladimir Safronov. Nicholls was the son of a Yorkshire miner who moved to the Shropshire area as a youngster. Tommy started boxing at the Sankey Club in Wellington (now Telford) when he was around 15, and within eight years had won Midlands, RAF, Imperial Services, ABA, and European titles. Nicholls won six Midlands ABA titles between 1950-56 and was the national ABA bantamweight champion in 1951 and 1952, and featherweight champion in 1955 and 1956. He won the first of many international honours for England against Scotland at Glasgow in 1951, and that same year lost to Ireland’s John Kelly in the European Championships at Milano. After completing two year’s National Service in the RAF, Nicholls returned civilian life in 1953 when he started boxing as a featherweight. He did not win his first ABA title at this new weight until 1955, when he also enjoyed his finest moment on the international stage in beating Aleksandr Zasukhin of the Soviet Union in West Berlin, to become the European champion. Nicholls was also voted the best boxer of the Championships. Another ABA title followed in 1956 as did that Olympic silver medal, before he eventually retired from the ring in 1957. Despite all his honours and titles, Nicholls’ greatest claim to fame was on live television in 1955. The ABA – United States match was being broadcast live from Wembley. Nicholls had started his bout against Golden Gloves champion Harvard Lancour when the cameras started rolling and the first thing the viewers saw was Nicholls knocking out his American opponent with a left hook in the first round. If that win over Lancour was sensational, Nicholls’ weigh-in before the 1951 International against Italy, also at Wembley, was bizarre. He was over the bantamweight limit when he first went to the scales for the weigh -in, and after some exercises, was still just over the limit. It was then suggested he stood on his head for a few minutes, and It worked. Nicholls made the weight, and went on to beat the European bantamweight champion Vincenzo Dall’Osso.",

He was president of the Cheltenham rifle club and also coached his daughter Veronica to become an excellent shot, and at the age of 19 she was Gloucestershire county champion. Clift had many interests. He was a keen sailor and was also interested in archaeology, and in 1908 was appointed honorary secretary of the British Archaeological Society.

For some time, Bianchini was the chairperson of the Swedish Artists Association. Her works were mainly presented in Scandinavia. The seven submitted works, which apparently are all scenes of sailing races, could not be identified; only some of the boats mentioned in the titles. The “Magda X”, for example, was built in Scotland in 1910 as “Sophie-Elisabeth”, sold to Norway a few years later and eventually renamed. “Zuleika” was built in Sweden in 1929 and sailed as “Ian” from 2005. The “Kitty” originated in the Netherlands and was renamed in 1931. The original name of the “Aavoryn” was “Luna V” and she was part of the Danish 10-meter fleet from 1923. In 1927 she was sold to Sweden and after several renamings she was again called “Aavoryn”.",

It was demolished in 1985 to make room for the new district of Fontvieille with a new stadium. The old stadium was located in the area of today’s Centre Commercial de Fontvieille. Son of an architect himself, Julien Médécin was admitted to the École des Beaus-Arts in 1917. In 1921, he graduated with the plans for a country house. In the following years, he worked as an architect in Paris and Nice and became architect of the city of Monte Carlo. At the Exposition Internationale des Arts Décoratifs et Industriels Modernes at Paris in 1925 Médécin also built the Pavillon de Monaco which was a luxurious residence reminiscent of Mediterranean Coast villas.

It was in basketball, however, that he would gain the most noteriety. He crowned a four-year career in that sport in 1949 when he graduated with a degree in business from the University of Western Ontario and won the Dr. Claude Brown Memorial Trophy for having “made the greatest contribution to athletics within the university”. He remained active with his alma mater following his graduation, working with alumni, taking graduate courses, and continuing to play basketball, for several years. In total he was a part of five University of Western Ontario collegiate championship teams, but was officially a member of the Tillsonburg Livingstons at the time he was selected to represent Canada in basketball at the 1952 Summer Olympics. At the Games, the Canadians won all three of their matches in the qualification round, defeating Italy, Egypt, and Romania, but then lost all three of their games in round one, against Brazil, Argentina, and the Philippines, and were eliminated from the tournament. Phibbs played in all six matches. Following the Games, Phibbs moved to Calgary and had a career in the oil industry, but remained athletically active by curling, golfing, and playing badminton and squash. He also served in an administrative capacity on many sports boards. He is a member of the University of Western Ontario Sports (1981), Tillsonburg (2004), Canadian Basketball (2008), and City of Windsor Sports (2008) Halls of Fame.",

He first came to international notice in 1993 when he won the last World Amateur Championship in the road race. After turning professional, Ullrich placed second at the 1996 Tour de France, winning the white jersey as the best young rider. He would improve on that in 1997 to win the Tour, adding a second white jersey. In 1998 he was unable to keep up with Marco Pantani, who won the Tour, but Ullrich placed second and added his third white jersey, one of only two riders, with Andy Schleck, to ever win that jersey three times. Over the next several years, Ullrich added multiple palmarès winning the World Championship in the time trial in 1999 and 2001, and at the 2000 Sydney Olympics, he won a gold medal in the road race and silver in the time trial. But the appearance of Lance Armstrong kept Ullrich from ever again winning the Tour de France. He placed second behind Armstrong in 2000-01 and 2003, third in 2005 and fourth in 2004. His five second-places at the Tour is not a record for the race, this belongs to Joop Zoetemelk with six. Ullrich also won the 1999 Vuelta à España and the 2004 and 2006 Tour de Suisse. He was often criticized for gaining weight in the off-season, and not training as much as he should, but Armstrong always said Ullrich was his strongest competitor. In 2006 he came under suspicion of doping and was banned from the Tour. He eventually retired in February 2007.

He qualified for the Olympic final as 7th, but then produced three fault jumps. Due to lack of progress, he was not selected for the 1954 European Championships, but in 1956 he emerged as a medal contender for the Olympics: at the open Romanian Championships, he set a new European Record at 7.98. However, the Dutch National Olympic Committee decided to boycott the Melbourne Olympics over the Soviet response to the Hungarian Revolt, and Visser - who had already travelled to Melbourne - was not allowed to compete. After missing the 1958 Europeans due to injury, Visser earned a scholarship at Bakersfield College in the US. He won the AAU championships in 1960, and with 7.97 was considered for a medal at the Rome Olympics, where he placed 7th in the final.

He then began an on-and-off association with the Kitchener-Waterloo Dutchmen that, at first, lasted for three seasons before he was transferred to the Hamilton Tigers for one year. He took the 1954-1955 season off and then returned for 1955-1956 for joint duty with the Dutchmen and the Elmira Polar Kings. He stuck with the Dutchmen until 1960 and joined them when they were asked to represent Canada at the 1960 Winter Olympics. At the tournament he was the backup goaltender, playing in only two matches, and took home a silver medal. He joined the Galt Terriers upon his return to Canada and, in his first season with the team, won the Allan Cup, given annually to the Canadian senior men’s ice hockey champions. This victory also garnered him an invitation to play with his team at the 1962 World Championships as a representative of Canada. At the tournament he was the only goalie to wear a face mask in the net and he took home another silver medal. He spent the 1962-1963 season with the Kitchener-Waterloo Tigers, in addition to suiting up for one game with the Buffalo Bisons of the American Hockey League. From there he joined the Guelph Regals in 1963 and skated with them until 1968, at which point he transferred to the Oakville Oaks for two years, although he spent some time assisting the Galt Hornets with an Allen Cup victory in 1969. He spent his final two seasons with the Hornets, which had formerly been the Galt Terriers, although he only played one game with them over that time span. The team won an Allan Cup in 1971, although Hurley is not always credited with the victory as he did not suit up for any games that season. In Junior A hockey, Hurley won the Turofsky Trophy, given to the goalie with the lowest goals against average, eight times, and was actually given permanent possession of it, although he donated it to the Hockey Hall of Fame. He was an accountant by trade and turned down offers to play with the Detroit Red Wings and the Toronto Maple Leafs because he felt that his job was more secure than professional hockey. After his retirement from that profession, he became a staple at many Galt and Kitchener-Waterloo reunions.",Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the World Ice Hockey Championships (0–2–0 1960 Squaw Valley (Olympics) silver; 1962 Colorado Springs and Denver silver)

Growing up in the seaside city of Wollongong and coached by his mother, Kerry found initial success as a competitive swimmer and lifesaving surfer as a teenager. In lifesaving, Kerry won the Cadet Malibu event at the 1974 Australian Championships, and in 1975 he came second in the surf race at the Australian Open Surfing Championships. As a swimmer, Kerry often trained with 1972 Olympic 400 freestyle champion Brad Cooper, who lived in Wollongong at that time. Kerry débuted at the Australian championships in 1976, surprisingly winning Australian titles in 200 m freestyle, 200 m backstroke, 4x200 m freestyle relay, and the medley relay, thus earning himself a spot on the Australian 1976 Olympic team. At the Olympics, the 16-year-old reached the finals of both the 100 and 200 backstroke, finishing in seventh and fifth place, respectively, and also was a member of the Australian medley relay that finished sixth. In 1977, Kerry successfully defended his 200 back title at the Australian championships and also won 4x100 m freestyle relay, 4x200 m freestyle relay, and medley relay titles. In January 1978, Kerry moved to the United States to attend Indiana University, studying theatre, drama and telecommunications. Based on the times recorded at Indiana, Kerry was named to the 1978 Australian Commonwealth Games team. However, Kerry and two of his teammates Mark Tonelli and Joe Dixon were expelled from the team due to breaking curfew on American Independence Day while at a training camp in Honolulu, Hawai’i. According to Tonelli, Kerry was out with a girl he had met, while Tonelli and Dixon had been drinking and smoking marijuana, which was not illegal in Hawai’i at the time. In 1979 Kerry transferred to the University of Southern California and competed at the 1979 Universiade, winning gold in the 100 m backstroke. In 1980, Kerry won both backstroke events and 4x100 freestyle and medley relay titles at the Australian championships to qualify for the Australian 1980 Olympic team. At the Olympics, Kerry was a member of the victorious Australian medley relay team and two days later won bronze in the 200 back. Kerry retired from swimming after the Olympics, but made a comeback in 1982, hoping to qualify for the 1982 Australian Commonwealth Games team. Although he was not chosen, Kerry decided to train until 1984 Olympics. Although he did not win an event at the 1984 Australian championships, Kerry was chosen to compete at his third Olympics in 1984, where he finished fifth in the 100 back and a day later won bronze as a member of the Australian medley relay. After his third Olympics, Kerry retired from competitive swimming for good and settled to in Los Angeles, working as a model.

This was the first Olympic medal won by a British windsurfer. Having won another bronze at the 2007 World Championship he was considered one of the favourites for the Beijing Games and was a contender for gold entering the final race. This time he could repeat the exploits of Athens and was placed fourth after a poor end to the competition. He rebounded by winning the world title in 2009 and was a silver medalist at the Olympic test event off the coast of Weymouth in 2011, and in 2013 he became the first man to win two World RS:X Windsurfing titles. Dempsey won a silver medal at the 2012 London Olympics when he recovered from a slow start to finish well behind the Dutch gold medalist Dorian van Rijsselberge. Whilst the result was the same in Rio four years later, it was Dempsey who raced away in the early stages winning three of the first four races but van Rijsselberge then dominated and won six of the final eight races to, again, capture the gold medal. Shortly after the Beijing Olympics, Dempsey married Olympian champion yachtswoman Sarah Ayton, although they later divorced. Dempsey subsequently dated Hannah Mills who replaced Ayton on the Great Britain team when she forfeited her place on the team to support her husband’s Qolympic quest.",Husband (divorced) of Sarah Ayton

One of the first women to adopt the Fosbury flop, she first medalled internationally in 1974, placing third at the European Championships. She jumped a flawless final at the 1976 Olympics until reaching 1.91 (a new personal best), which was only bettered by Rosemarie Ackermann, leaving the silver to Simeoni. Her best result came two years. At a meet in Brescia, she cleared 2.01 metres for a world record, becoming the second woman (after Ackermann) to clear 2 metres. She equalled the mark just weeks later at the European Championships in Prague, beating Ackermann by two centimeters. She did so again at the Moscow Olympics, where she bettered the Olympic Record to 1.97 and won the Olympic gold. In the years to follow, Simeoni suffered from a lingering tendon injury, although despite that, she did win bronze at the 1982 Europeans (though she lost her world record to Ulrike Meyfarth), but she also bowed out early at the inaugural 1983 World Championships in Helsinki. The flagbearer for the Italian team at the Los Angeles Olympics, she starred for the last time.

His nemesis at the 1912 Olympics was McGill University student George Hodgson of Canada and, while Hatfield was clearly superior to all the other swimmers, the Canadian’s performances were remarkable and the Englishman had to be satisfied with two silver medal in the longer freestyle events and a bronze from the relay. Hatfield won his first national title on his return from Sweden and was the outstanding British swimmer over the next two years. A rematch with Hodgson at the 1916 Olympic Games would have been an exciting prospect but in the week the Games were to be held Hatfield was a soldier in the trenches of Northern France, where he spent much of the Great War. He returned to the sport in 1920 but did not reach the standard he attained in the pre-war years until the following year when he repeated his feat of 1913 and won four national titles. Hatfield’s third Olympic Games in Paris in 1924 saw him reach the same two individual finals he had reached twelve years earlier, only this time he could not make an impression of the medal standings. A regular member of the England and Great Britain water polo teams throughout the 20s, his farewell Olympic appearance in 1928 combined the British team’s run to the semi-finals of the water polo tournament with a heat swim in the 400 m freestyle. Hatfield won 42 ASA titles over a 20-year career and used his fame to become a successful businessman with a chain of sport shops across the north-east of England. He was also a director of Middlesbrough Football Club.

In Munich he defeated opponents from Guyana, the Soviet Union and Algeria before losing in the semi-final to the home fighter Dieter Kottysch on a split decision. He turned professional in October 1972 but his progress was checked by the susceptibility to cut easily and at one point he lost four out of seven fights this way. Minter recovered to win the British middleweight title in 1975 and added the European title in 1977. Having lost the European crown due to another stoppage on cuts he regained it in 1978 albeit in tragic circumstances. Fighting against Angelo Jacopucci in Italy, Minter dealt a savage beating to his opponent who later collapsed in his dressing room. Jacopucci lapsed into a coma and died the next day. The ringside doctor was later convicted of manslaughter. After a run of victories Minter travelled to Las Vegas and won the undisputed world middleweight title with a victory over Italy’s Vito Antofuermo. After a defence in which he stopped Antofuermo he was matched with the leading contender, Marvin Hagler of the USA, the fight being held in London. In an interview prior to the fight, Minter told the BBC that “no black man is going to take my title away”. Although he later retracted the statement and said that he merely meant to say “no man is going to take my title”, this brought an atmosphere of racial tension to the match and when Hagler defeated Minter some sections of the crowd rioted, throwing beer cans and seats into the ring. Minter retired after losing an attempt on the European title in 1981.",Listed in Olympic Boxers Who Won a Professional World Championship (Olympics - 1972 Light-Middleweight (Bronze); Professional World Champion - WBC Middleweight (1980-1980); Undisputed Middleweight (1980-1980).)

Given the circumstances, however, he had limited opportunities to train for the 1948 London Olympics, where he competed in the coxless fours, representing Yugoslavia. There, he was eliminated in the round one repêchage alongside Klement Alujević, Mate Mojtić, and Petar Ozretić. Lipanović continued rowing through 1956, but never attended another edition of the Games, although he did win national championships in 1950 and 1951. He later worked on a tuna fishing boat.

3378,Henry Cooper,Male,3 May 1934,,, Great Britain,GBR,"One of the most popular figures in British sporting history, Cooper was Amateur Boxing Association light-heavyweight champion in 1952 at the age of just seventeen. Picked to compete for Great Britain in the Helsinki Olympics he was defeated in his opening contest by the eventual bronze medallist, Perov of the USSR. He retained his national amateur championship in 1953 then turned professional the next year. After a period where he lost as many fights as he won Cooper’s career flourished from the late fifties and he won both British and British Empire Heavyweight titles. In the summer of 1963 he was matched with the unbeaten 1960 Olympic light-heavyweight champion Cassius Clay. Clay had commented before the bout that “Henry Cooper is nothing to me! If this bum goes over five rounds, I won’t return to the United States for 30 days, and that’s final! I’m not even worried about this big bum Cooper will only be a warm-up until I get to that big ugly bear Sonny Liston!” Cooper’s strongest weapon was his left hook, the press had labelled it “Enery’s ‘Ammer” (Cockney slang for Henry’s Hammer) and at the end of round four it landed squarely on Clay’s chin and the American fell to the canvas. Unfortunately for Cooper this came in the final seconds of the round and by the start of the next round Clay had recovered. The referee stopped the contest in the fifth round when Cooper’s facial cuts became too bad to continue. He rebounded to win the European title and three years after their initial contest he would step into the ring to face Clay, now under his new name of Muhammad Ali, this time for the world title. The second meeting ended as the first did with Cooper’s face a bloody mess. Although he would never again fight for a world title he defended his British, British Commonwealth and European titles until 1971 when he lost them all in his last professional bout. He held the British and British Empire/Commonwealth titles for twelve years between 1959 and 1971 and the European title on three separate occasions in the sixties and early seventies. A small heavyweight, he boxed before the introduction of the cruiserweight division and struggled against the heavier fighters in his division while his propensity to cut easily also hampered his career. On his retirement he became a popular television personality, appearing on the BBC quiz show “A Question of Sport” and also in adverts for aftershave. One of only three sportsmen to have won the BBC’s Sports Personality of the Year award twice (1967 & 1970), in 2000 he became the first boxer to be awarded a knighthood.",Listed in Olympians Who Acted in Movies (Notably as John Gully MP in Royal Flash.)

She was considered a gold medal favorite in the freestyle skiing moguls event at the beginning of the 2006 Games, mainly due to her first-place successes in the 2004 and 2005 World Championships. In addition, she had missed out on the bronze at the same event in 2002 by only 1/100th of a point. Prior to her Olympic victory she had experienced health problems and took the 2003 season off to treat chronic shin splints, but came back in full force over the next several years, with 14 podium finishes in World Cup events in 2004 and 2005 and gold in dual moguls at the 2005 World Championships. After more victories at the 2007 World Championships, she was named Canadian Female Athlete of the Year. Two years later she captured silver in the moguls and gold in the dual moguls at the 2009 World Championships. At the 2010 Winter Olympics she was considered the most likely individual to break Canada’s drought of Olympic gold medals on home soil, and nearly did so in the moguls event, but a spectacular final run by American Hannah Kearney left Heil with a silver medal. Canada would have to wait one more day before Alexandre Bilodeau captured gold in the men’s moguls, the first of a Winter Olympic record-breaking 14 for Canada. Nevertheless, Heil’s was still the first medal for Canada at the 2010 Games. Due to her success, she was been the recipient of considerable external funding and had a sports psychologist and a nutritionist on her team at all times. She was a business and management student at McGill University, an athlete ambassador for David Suzuki’s “Play It Cool” program, and travelled to Rwanda and Burkina Faso with organizations promoting the importance of sport.

From 1888 he studied at the School of Applied Arts in Wien (Vienna). He worked mainly in wood and created numerous animal sculptures as well as nudes, beginning as a woodcarver. He was also engaged in religious art. From 1904-06 he was a teacher at the woodworking school in Villach, later at the School of Applied Arts in Wien. By participating in the exhibitions of the Hagenbund in 1905 he found his own style and worked in the shallow section. Around 1910 Barwig developed an interest in depictions of animals, for which he carried out studies at the Schönbrunn zoo. He also devoted himself to the art of the Secession and started training with other materials, especially bronze. Beside nudes, he also created portrayals of farmers. In 1925 he became a member of the Vienna Secession and went to Palm Beach for two years. There was some concern that the Olympic artist was the son of the same name, who was also a sculptor, but more recent research has found that it was the father who entered the Arts Competition. Suffering from the effects of a progressive neurologic disorder, Barwig committed suicide by shooting himself with a pistol. In the 1927 München exhibition in the Glaspalast a Young man’s figure was shown made of wood by Barwig. This could have been one of his 1928 entries.

Smillie became a miner at the age of 17 and worked at the Woodmuir Colliery, where a colleague of his was boxer Tommy Thompson who persuaded Smillie to go with him to the Fauldhouse Miners Club, and his love of boxing started. Only a few months after taking up the sport, Smillie was the flyweight runner-up in the youth section of the Eastern District of the Scottish ABA Championships. In his first year as a senior in 1952, Smillie succeeded Thomson as National Coal Board (NCB) flyweight champion and also reached the final of the Scottish ABA Championships. It was his only defeat that year, and he subsequently went to the Helsinki Olympics as a reserve to Welshman Dai Dower. The following year, Smillie won the British ABA bantamweight title, retained his NCB title, and then competed in the European Championships at Warszawa (Warsaw), where he lost to Ireland’s Olympic silver medallist John McNally in the quarter-final. Smillie retained his ABA, Scottish ABA, and NCB titles in 1954, and at the British Empire and Commonwealth Games at Vancouver beat Gordon Smith of Southern Rhodesia to win the gold medal. Smillie announced his retirement after winning his Commonwealth gold, and had plans to emigrate to Australia. He changed his mind on both counts, however, and turned professional in January 1955. In 1957 he was stopped by fellow-Scot Peter Keenan for the British and Commonwealth bantamweight titles. Smillie did move to Australia in 1962 and the last eight fights of his career were all in Melbourne.

At the age of 17, however, he nearly died after a bicycle accident and thus had to overcome his injuries in order to participate in sport. He won his first rowing championship, the Maritime Junior Championship, in 1905, followed by the St. John’s Harbor Championships in 1906. He planned to attend the 1908 Summer Olympics, but his amateur status was revoked in 1907 after he allegedly accepted money for a speed skating tour, and it was not restored until 1909. He set a world record in the 1.5 mile single sculls event at the 1921 New England Single Scull Championship with a time of 9:36, beating the previous mark set by Olympic gold medalist Frank Greer. He also took the event at the 1921 and 1922 Canadian Championships. By 1924 he looked to be a strong contender in the single sculls event at the year’s Summer Olympic Games in Paris, but contracted neuritis in his hip while training in England shortly prior to the tournament. He did not perform well with his condition, but the French government granted him a scroll and an honorary Olympic bronze medal for his sportsmanship (the official bronze medal went to Josef Schneider of Switzerland). The owner of the Carleton Skating Rink in St. John’s, Newfoundland, Belyea was equally successful in his speed skating career, winning both the St John’s City and Maritime Skating Championships in 1920. He set another record, this time in the one mile speed skating event, in 1909 with a time of 2:52.45, which was broken five years later by future Olympic bronze medalist Willy Logan. He lived in the United States later in life and died in Albany, New York in 1968, where his family had moved forty years earlier. He was inducted into the New Brunswick Sports Hall of Fame in 1971.",

He studied in München, Zürich, and Dresden, but did not graduate. In 1912, he was a member of a historic expedition to Greenland. His brother Roland died in 1916 during World War I in a French military hospital. Roderich served in the then German colony of Cameroon, but was also interned for three years in Spain after crossing the border into a Spanish colony. During the Third Reich he initially became one of the favorite architects of Nazi chancellor Adolf Hitler, and was one of the busiest architects on the Obersalzberg, Hitler’s favorite residence, until his tensions with Hitler’s secretary Martin Bormann led to a split. After World War II he was suspended from his services and, in 1946, was convicted by the Munich Tribunal of lesser offenses. In 1948, however, he was finally classified by the Starnberg Tribunal as a follower and beneficiary of the Nazi regime. He worked as a freelance architect, and was retired on a pension in 1954. Fick’s buildings followed the principles of the homeland security architecture and the Deutscher Werkbund and thus differed from the many monumental buildings of the Nazi era. His “Ernst-Sachs-Bath in Schweinfurt” was one of his first major assignments in 1931, possibly also because his brother-in-law was a senior civil engineer there. Fick not only designed the building, which was completed in 1933, but also doors, windows and furniture, and even luminous elements and fittings. The bath was severely damaged during the war but was in operation until 2004 after reconstruction. After that it was rebuilt as an art exhibition hall.",

86694,Finn Hodt,Male,16 June 1919,178.0,68, Norway,NOR,"Finn Hodt was a legend in Norwegian speed skating, mostly for his work as coach, team leader, and motivator for the leading Norwegian skaters from 1961 to 1994. He started his skating career in 1933 when he finished second in the primary school championships in his home town Drammen. He joined Drammen Skøiteklub a few days later, and in the same season became club champion for boys 12-14 years old. In his youth Hodt excelled in several sports: ski jumping, cross-country skiing, football (he played for Strømsgodset IF when the club won the 1936 national junior championship), and athletics (long jump of 6.33 at age 16). In speed skating he excelled as a sprinter, with an unofficial junior world record of 43.8 in 1938 and an unofficial national record of 42.3 in 1940 on a 250 m track in Bergen. In 1940 he won the 500 metres in the Norwegian All-Around Championships in Hamar. After the German occupation of Norway in April 1940, the Norwegian sports associations boycotted after the Quisling regime tried to take control over all sports events in Norway. Hodt was persuaded not to follow the boycott, and participated in German-controlled speed skating events from 1941-45. After the war, Hodt returned to speed skating in 1950, and in 1952 skated 43.4 in the 500 metres and was nominated by the Norwegian Skating Union for the 1952 Oslo Olympics, but the Norwegian NOC rejected his selection because he had collaborated during the German occupation in World War II. He continued to participate, and won the 500 m at the Norwegian Allround Championships in 1951, 1953-54 and 1957, and won bronze medals in the All-Around Championships in 1953-54 and 1957. Hodt was selected to skate the 500 m at Cortina in 1956, and finished in 13th, beating Yoshitaki Hori from Japan 42.5 to 42.8 in the 18th pair. Hodt ended his active career in 1960, by then almost 41-years-old, and immediately entered a new career as an administrator, coach, team leader, and referee for speed skating. Hodt was a coach at the 1964 Winter Olympics and team leader at the 1980, 1992 and 1994 Games. He coached successful Olympic skaters such as Olympic medalists Fred A. Maier, Roar Grønvold, and Sten Stensen. Hodt was chairman of Drammens SK for several periods, and chairman of the Norwegian Skating Union’s Speed Skating Committee from 1965-67 and from 1972-73. In 1992 he was awarded the Golden Token, the highest award of the Union. In the 1950s Hodt built up his own company and was a successful businessman, specializing in concrete building elements. Before his 1986 retirement he sold his company to a large Norwegian construction firm. Personal Bests: 500 – 42.3 (1940); 1500 – 2:17.0 (1956); 5000 – 8:31.7 (1954); 10000 – 17:36.8 (1954).",

Beginning in 1920, he taught at numerous art schools in various states. Davey was also a pioneer as a race car driver, but tragically died in a traffic accident in 1964. According to the 1932 catalog, his entry was an oil painting or watercolor. Davey depicted numerous motifs of horse racing and the title Horse Race is very general. The most likely candidate is the oil painting In the Stretch (oil on board, 36 x 51 cm), which was also created in this period.",Listed in Olympians Who Died in Motor Vehicle Accidents (Boat/Car/Motorcycle/Train) (Died in a car accident.)

Richardson then lost two whole seasons to injury and did not race again until 1995.

He continued his momentum into 1997 and only narrowly missed a 400 metre medal at the year’s World Championships. Richardson also helped Great Britain to a silver medal in the 4×400 which, after a confession of doping by American team member Antonio Pettigrew, was upgraded to gold a decade later. He inflicted a rare defeat on Michael Johnson in the early part of the 1998 season and later won the European Cup but in the biggest races of the year he was overshadowed by fellow countryman Iwan Thomas and placed third behind him at the European Championship and second at the Commonwealth Games.

His greatest success was the victory in the Grand Prix of the international tournament in Lisboa in 1918. In 1919-21 he lived in exile in Spain, after being imprisoned for his participation in the failed monarchist revolt and then escaping from prison. In Spain, he participated in the bullfighting business. After an amnesty, Maya returned to Portugal and scraped by with various jobs: as a horseman, riding instructor, and surveyor. In 1930 he was deported to Funchal on Madeira for a few months. It was only there that he began to paint and decided to become an artist. After his return to Lisboa, Maya developed a personal artistic style and became the first Portuguese sculptor to create sculptures in iron and other metals such as tinplate, copper, silver, and gold. The main subject of his work was the anatomy and movement of horses, bulls, and other animals. In contrast to other sculptors, he concentrated on small-scale sculptures for interiors. His first exhibition took place as early as 1931. In the following years Maya exhibited mostly in Portugal, Spain, France, and Latin America. After António Salazar’s seizure of power, he no longer received public commissions and was prevented from exhibiting. According to the 1952 Official Report, he presented a bronze sculpture entitled International Horse Race in Lisbon in 1945. However, this title cannot be found in other sources. Actually, it is possible that he exhibited two works in 1952: Vencedor (Winner), also called Turf Club, may well be the one mentioned in the report. The sculpture of cut iron sheet has the format 45 x 50 x 27 cm. Possibly it was created as early as in the 1930s. According to a dissertation on Maya dated 1952, he is said to have submitted a Discóbolo (Discus Thrower). Two different works with this title are known from 1952, one made of chromed sheet brass on wood (20 x 21 x 12 cm), the second of sheet iron and wood (15 x 25 x 8 cm).",

His grandfather, father and uncle were great architects also, who shaped the development of the city of Los Angeles in a significant way. His wife Mary (1911-78) was one of the most famous graphic designers with Walt Disney Productions. Lee Blair began his career with watercolor paintings. The close friendship of the couple to Walt Disney (1901-66) helped them become involved in film and comic productions mostly, and especially with television commercials and animations. His brother Preston (1908-95) was also an animator for Disney. From 1938, Lee Blair worked for Walt Disney Productions as a color and animation specialist and was engaged, for example, in the films “Bambi” and “Pinocchio”. He received numerous awards for this work. He also taught landscape painting in Los Angeles for some time. During World War II, he produced instructional films for the Navy. After the war, he founded his own company, Film/TV Graphics, Inc. From 1968, he was active again primarily as a painter and taught, for instance, at the University of California Santa Cruz. In 1932 Lee Everett won a gold medal in the art competitions of the Olympic Games for his watercolor Rodeo Day, aka simply Rodeo. The work made the California Style of watercolor painting famous. After the Olympics it went to Blair’s old school, the Polytechnic High School in Los Angeles. Hanging in the library for a long time, it was probably lost when the school moved to Sun Valley.

8694,Evander Holyfield,Male,19 October 1962,185.0,81, United States,USA,"Evander Holyfield competed as a light-heavyweight at the 1984 Olympics, winning a controversial bronze medal. In the semi-finals he was competing against New Zealander Kevin Barry, and was controlling the fight. Near the end of the second round, Holyfield hammered Barry’s ribs with a right, and then unloaded with a left hook that floored Barry. The official, a Yugoslav named Gligorije Novičić, waved Holyfield to a neutral corner and then counted out Barry. He then turned to Holyfield and disqualified him for a purported late hit, saying he had told him to break prior to the left hook. Films did seem to confirm this, but even Barry told Holyfield that “You won the fight fair and square.” The pro-American crowd went crazy, and Novičić had to receive a police escort to exit the arena. Barry had won, but could not fight in the finals because he had been knocked out and amateur rules prohibited a knocked out boxer from fighting for 28 days. After the Olympics Holyfield turned professional and would have one of the greatest ever professional careers. In 1985 he won the WBA cruiserweight title by defeating Dwight Muhammad Qawi. He soon became the undisputed cruiserweight champion and in 1988 moved up to heavyweight, defeating Buster Douglas and would then become the undisputed heavyweight champion. Holyfield fought two memorable bouts against Mike Tyson, with the second fight in 1997 mostly known because, during a clinch, Tyson bit off a portion of Holyfield’s right ear, which caused him to be disqualified. Holyfield is the only person to have been world heavyweight champion four times, winning the WBA, WBC, and IBF titles in 1990, the WBA and IBF titles in 1993 and the WBA title in 1996 and 2000. During his career he had notable victories over George Foreman, Larry Holmes, Riddick Bowe, Ray Mercer, Mike Tyson (twice), Michael Moorer, John Ruiz, Michael Dokes and Hasim Rahman. Holyfield finished his career in 2012 with a record of 44 wins (29 by KO) and 10 losses.

Although born in England, the siblings moved to Iraq where their father worked in the Colonial Service. They moved to Palestine and then returned to England before the end of World War II. It was during their time in Palestine that the boys first sailed an X-One Design boat at the age of eight. Sixty-eight years later, Stuart was still winning X-One (XOD) races at Cowes. Stuart and Aldo won the first of many national titles when they won the 1951 Firefly Championship. After attending the Royal Military College at Sandhurst, Stuart joined the Royal Engineers in 1955 and in a long and distinguished career rose to the rank of lieutenant colonel. He was awarded the OBE in 1988. Despite many years in the Army, they allowed him time off to enjoy his sporting pursuits. Stuart started racing in the Flying Dutchman class in 1959 and won that year’s French Olympic regatta. He was subsequently selected as a reserve for the 1960 Rome Olympics. Jardine won the UK Flying Dutchman Championship four times between 1961-65, and was third in the 1962 World Championship. Having acquired his first Star Class boat in 1967 he was selected for the Mexico City Olympics the following year and finished 10th with James Ramus. Jardine went to his second Olympics at München four years later and, with John Wastall, finished seventh overall, despite leading after race one. Having been posted to the Royal Engineers Diving establishment in 1982 Jardine played a part in the raising of the Mary Rose later that year. She was one of the biggest ships in King Henry VIII’s Navy and was sunk in battle in 1545 and lay on the bottom of the River Solent for 427 years. Jardine’s long sailing career saw him sail most classes from dinghies to three-quarter ton vessels. He captained the Army and Royal Engineers dinghy teams for many years and won the Inter-Services Gold Cup 13 times. In the 1990s Jardine started sailing J/24 class boats and in addition to winning the UK Championship six times he also won the 1995 European Championship at the age of 62. Also, in the 1990s, Stuart and Ado won the International Masters Regatta at Los Angeles three years in succession 1995-97. After many years away from XOD, Stuart returned to the class in the 1990s and in 1996 won the coveted Captain’s Cup at Cowes Week. It is one of the hardest trophies to win as it is awarded to the yacht with the best individual record during the week. Not content with winning it aboard Oyster in 1996, Jardine went on to guide Lone Star to victory on six occasions between 1999-2009. His seven wins remained a record at the time of his death in 2023. Stuart Jardine was a member of the Royal Lymington Yacht Club for many years, and when he won his final major event, at the Royal Solent Yacht Club in 2018, he was aged 84.",Twin brother of Adrian Jardine

Having comfortably won his first mile race in 1903 he continued to attract a great deal of attention, notably after winning a two miles handicap event at Atherton in 1904. Grantham was given a 160-yard start over the reigning international cross-country champion, Alf Shrubb, and the Alderley Edge man shot to the front at the bell, and with 150 yards to go, Shrubb gave up his pursuit, and Grantham captured a notable scalp. Grantham was employed as a train driver with a local brickworks near to his Alderley home. His talent attracted the attention of the the crack Salford Harriers team whom he joined. He switched his attention to steeplechasing in 1907, and the following year placed third in the AAA steeplechase, but failed to finish in his heat at the Olympics. In 1911, he won the Northern Counties ¾-mile steeplechase after a dramatic finale to the race. Grantham and A. Holland of Hallamshire were neck-and-neck going into the final water jump, but Holland fell and Grantham romped home an easy winner.

He picked the teams for the 1972 and 1976 Olympics, and the presence of Anilus Joseph in the 10,000 metres at München confirmed this. It was Joseph’s first race over the distance and he soon showed clear evidence of this. In the third heat, he set off as if it was an 800-metre race. He covered the first lap in 59.6 seconds and opened up a lead of 50 meters. He was still in first place after two laps but he then ran out of steam, and by the 1,000-metre mark was in last place. By the eighth lap, Joseph had been lapped by all the other athletes, and by the 12th had been lapped again. When the bell signalled the final lap for the leaders, Joseph thought that it meant that he too only had one more lap to go, so he began sprinting again, until he was informed by an official that even though all the other runners had finished, he still had over a kilometre to run.

This election was not only due to him being the first winner of the Olympic gold medal in the 10km Open Water Swimming but also to the fact that he managed to do so after recovering from acute leukemia. The illness was diagnosed in 2001 after complaints of double vision and shortness of breath. The treatment of the disease took two years, 4 chemo treatments and a stem cell transplant. Before the diagnosis of his disease van der Weijden was already a multiple Dutch champion in the longer freestyle events and placed in the top 10 in the 5 and 10 km at the 2000 Open Water World Championships in Honolulu. His comeback after his disease began in 2003. In 2005 he started making his mark in international races, winning several World Cup races. In 2006 he joined the Nationaal Zweminstituut Eindhoven, where Pieter van den Hoogenband also trained. Van den Hoogenband kept urging van der Weijden on, repeating that he was the best and that he could win gold. In 2006 he won the silver medal in the 10km at the European Championships and in 2008 won the world title in the 25km. Dutch television viewers will always remember the finish of his golden race in Beijing, not only because of his win but also because of the unbridled enthusiasm of van den Hoogenband. Van den Hoogenband was a guest and co-commentator of the Dutch TV; during the last metres of the race he switched from commentator to fan and urged van der Weijden on. At the ceremony of the award for Sportsman of the Year van der Weijden announced his retirement as active swimmer. He felt that during his preparation for the Olympics he had done everything he could in sports. Indeed, in the last months before the race, he had temporarily broken off his relationship with his girlfriend and spent 15 hours per day in an altitude tent.

He was champion again in 1935 and with victories in each of the next four years up to the outbreak of war, he won a total of six championships. Whitlock traded wins with Tommy Green, the 1932 Olympic champion, in many of the classic road race of the thirties but as he was ten years Green’s junior, Whitlock inevitably got the upper hand as the years passed. In 1934 he won the first of four successive London-to-Brighton races and in 1935 he became the first man to complete the course in under eight hours. His winning time of 4-30:38 in the 1936 RWA 50km championship ultimately proved to be the fastest of his career and established him as one of the favorites for the Olympic title. Like the other British walkers in Berlin, Whitlock suffered from a severe bout of sickness during the race but he overcame the handicap and retained the Olympic title for Britain by a comfortable margin. Two years later, he completed a magnificent double by winning the 1938 European title in Paris. In the immediate post-war years, he only competed intermittently, but his younger brother Rex upheld the family tradition with his selection for the 1948 Olympics. In 1952, Harold made a serious comeback and after finishing third in the RWA 50 km. he made a second Olympic appearance in Helsinki, aged 48 years 218 days; he still holds the record of being Britain’s oldest ever international athlete. In Helsinki, he finished 11th, a creditable performance in a field of 31, but his brother Rex Whitlock did even better, finishing fourth. Harold Whitlock, a tall stylish walker who was a member of the Metropolitan Walking Club, worked as a motor mechanic and as he had a special aptitude for tuning racing cars he was often called upon to assist with record attempts at the old Brooklands circuit. A highly respected coach and judge in his later years, he officiated at the 1960 Olympics in Rome when his star pupil, Don Thompson, won the gold medal. In 1966, Whitlock was awarded the MBE for his services to the sport.

Their daughter Beate later became one of the most impressive ceramic artists in Germany. Kuhn first graduated as a school teacher for art, studying under Max Liebermann and Lovis Corinth. Subsequently, Kuhn studied engraving and etching at the Academy of Fine Arts in Berlin before he served as a volunteer in World War I. In 1918 he settled in the Black Forest and started sculpturing as an autodidact. After extensive travelling to various places in Italy, he moved to Düsseldorf in 1926, started teaching at the local art academy and worked as a sculptor. In 1932 he toured the Dutch East Indies. Although some of his works were classified as “entartet” (degenerate) in 1937, he was commissioned to produce several large scale steel relief and sculptures for industrial buildings in Germany and allowed to take part in various exhibitions. During World War II the family’s home in Düsseldorf was bombed out and they moved to Hinterzarten / Black Forest. After World War II he taught at the School of Applied Arts in Wiesbaden from 1949-55. In 1967, Erich Kuhn was fatally injured, when his car broke down on the highway and he was going to set up a warning triangle. Unfortunately, a following motorist did not see him and ran over him. Kuhn worked mainly in wood and stone and created numerous nudes and portraits. Two notable works are an ornate table, presented to Adolf Hitler in 1939 by steel industrialist Alfried Krupp von Bohlen und Halbach, and the stone relief History of Swimming produced in the mid-1960s for the Rheinbad, Düsseldorf, at that time the largest swimming pool in Europe. The relief Skating was probably created in 1935 for the ice rink in Dusseldorf. It was made of stainless Krupp steel.

From 1912 to 1924, he served as the team captain of the British fencing team. The Jewish fencer was also an accomplished painter, exhibiting at the Royal Academy and the Fine Art Society in London. He also entered works in the Olympic art competitions of the 1928 and 1932 Games. The title of Seligman’s self-portrait in the catalog is originally supplemented by details of his successes: Portrait of the artist, champion of Great Britain in epee, foil, saber; four times in the finals at the Olympic Games. He donated the picture to the Amateur Fencing Association (AFA), later renamed the British Fencing Association.

Already a talented footballer, he started playing around his adopted hometown of Odesa, Ukraine and later, when studying engineering in Moscow, he joined the famous Torpedo Moscow club. With Torpedo he won the Soviet Cup in 1949 and 1952, although the club was generally overshadowed by Moscow rival Dynamo and CSKA during this period. He was included in the Soviet Union squad for the 1952 Olympic Games, although he never played in any of their three matches. The same year he became the first foreign born sportsman to be awarded the title of Soviet Masters of Sports. In 1956 General Franco allowed a small number of exiles to return home to Spain. Allegedly at the behest of the Communist Party of Spain, Pagola signed to play for Athletico Madrid even though he was unfit and coming to the end of his career. The strong rumour was that, as a Soviet Communist Party loyalist, he would be a useful “cover” to reorganize the party from inside the country. He soon left Madrid to train a series of clubs in the Basque Country and was elected general secretary of the region’s Communist Party. In 1961 he was arrested and sent to the Carabanchel Prison in Madrid where he was allegedly tortured by the security police. This caused a serious diplomatic incident with the USSR and the Spanish authorities were eventually forced to let him go into exile in Paris. Towards the end of the decade his pro-Soviet leanings caused friction between him and the leaders of the Spanish Communist Party and he was expelled from the movement. He returned to Moscow shortly before his death in 1975, just days before Franco died.",

Born in Algeria, then a part of France, Alain Mimoun was drafted into the French Army at the outbreak of the War, and fought in France, North Africa, Italy, and in the invasion of southern France of 1944. Despite the war, he had been able to pick up running, and after the liberation Mimoun worked as a waiter at the Racing Club de France in Paris, for which he also competed. After winning the first of his 29 French national titles in 1947, Alain Mimoun first competed in the Olympics in 1948. Still fairly unknown, Mimoun collected a silver medal in the 10,000 m, being the first of two runners not lapped by the overwhelming winner, Zátopek. The Czechoslovakian “Locomotive” would also finish ahead of Mimoun in the 1950 European Championships (5,000 and 10,000 m) and the 1952 Olympics (again 5,000 and 10,000 m). In the International Cross Country Championships (precursor of the World Championships), Zátopek did not compete, and Mimoun won the event four times (1949, 1952, 1954, 1956), finishing second twice. But Mimoun’s ultimate moment of glory came in 1956. Making his début in the marathon, he dominated the Olympic race in Melbourne, leading from the start and winning by 1 minute 32 seconds. Zátopek, not in top shape, finished sixth. In his wonderful book, All That Glitters is Not Gold, William Oscar Johnson related the story as told to him by Mimoun. When he finished he waited for Zátopek to arrive. When he did, he did not at first acknowledge Mimoun, being in some distress. Mimoun then told him, “Emil, it was I who won.” Zátopek then turned around and saluted Mimoun, his close friend. Telling the story years later, Mimoun noted, “Oh, for me that was better than the medal.” Mimoun would make one more Olympic appearance, coming 34th in the marathon in 1960. In addition to the aforementioned prizes, Mimoun also won four gold medals in the Mediterranean Games. His last French marathon title came in 1966, winning his sixth title in that event, a record that remains unbeaten.

Whilst Foster was regarded as being a brilliant technical rower, he lacked the raw strength and power of many of his peers and was always prone to injury. This was evident when he missed the entire 1993 season when he was forced to have a serious operation on his back.

The crew won the 1997 and 1998 World Championships and retained the title in 1999 despite the absence of Foster who suffered a recurrence of his back injury.

Later that year he won the Greek national marathon title, and was soon chosen to compete for Greece in the marathon at the 1936 Berlin Olympics, where he finished 11th. Kyriakidis was a 14-time winner at the Pan-Cyprian Games and an 11-time Greek National Champion. He also competed at the 1948 London Olympics. Kyriakidis joined the Greek resistance during World War II, and during the Nazi occupation of his homeland, he twice evaded execution when he was recognized by his Nazi tormenters as an Olympic athlete. After the war, he was emaciated, having lost much weight, and sold his furniture to buy a ticket to the United States to run in the 1946 Boston Marathon, although he was also supported by Greek-Americans Giorgios and Spyros Demeter. His goal in running was not just to try to win the marathon, but to persuade Americans to help send food and supplies to his war-torn nation. Near the end of the 1946 Boston Marathon Kyriakidis was running alongside his close friend Johnny Kelley, when an older Greek-American in the crowd yelled out, “For Greece, for your children.” Inspired, Kyriakidis pulled away to win the race, considered perhaps the most emotional victory ever at the Boston Marathon. Kyriakidis was successful in his other goal, as his efforts helped raise over 25,000 tons of supplies for his homeland. When he returned to Greece, over 1,000,000 Greeks lined the streets of Athina to greet him, a ceremony was held in his honor at the Temple of Zeus, and the Acropolis was illuminated in his honor, the first such lighting after World War II. He was later given the Grand Cross of the Phoenix by the Greek King. In 2004 a statue of Kyriakidis was placed one mile beyond the Hopkinton starting line of the Boston Marathon, entitled “The Spirit of the Marathon.” A copy of the same statue was also placed in Marathon, Greece.

At the 1956 Olympics, Weldon became the first British rider to win an individual Olympic equestrian medal and in addition to his bronze in the individual three-day event he won a gold medal in the team competition. Weldon would almost certainly have won the individual gold medal had he not insisted, as team captain, on a policy of strict caution in the cross-country section. At the 1955 European Championships and at the 1956 Olympics, Frank Weldon was riding his own horse, Kilbarry, whom he had ridden earlier in the Queen’s Coronation process when he commanded the King’s Troop of the Royal Horse Artillery. An Irish-bred, grey gelding, Kilbarry is almost certainly the only horse to have won international fame while still doing full daily duty as an officer’s charger in a Calvary regiment. Weldon made a second Olympic appearance in 1960 when he finished 25th individually and the British placed fourth in the team event. Frank Weldon was educated at Wellington and the Royal Military College and won his colours in the rugby XV both at school and at Sandhurst. After he retired from the Army and from equestrian competition he continued to make a great contribution to the sport. He served as Director of Badminton Horse Trials from 1966 to 1988 after having been asked, in 1964, to design the Badminton cross-country course. He was also a council member of the British Horse Society and was the equestrian correspondent of the Sunday Telegraph for many years.",

Her husband, Alan Samuel Butler, whom she married in 1925, was the chairman of the De Havilland Aircraft Company, which gave her access to many resources that would have otherwise been unavailable to women seeking to fly in her era. In 1928 the duo (with Lois as a passenger) set a world speed record for two-seater light airplanes and, a year later, Lois obtained her own private pilot’s license. She began competing in air races in the 1930, including the king’s cup air race and the Europa Rundflug, a 7000 mile race around Europe. By 1939 she had logged over 300 flight hours and was invited to be one of the first eight women to join the Air Transport Auxiliary, a British civilian organization that, during World War II, ferried military aircraft where they were needed. By the conflict’s end she had logged more than 1,000 flight hours and flown 36 different types of Royal Navy and Royal Air Force aircraft.

His father was an Oxford-educated barrister and Frank followed in his father’s footstep. He was originally educated at Cranleigh boarding school from 1910, where he was secretary of both the football and cricket XIs. He was also a member of the school’s highly successful gymnastics team that were regular winners of the Public Schools Gymnastics competition at Aldershot. After Cranleigh, where he was one of the college’s first black students, Dove, like his father, went to Oxford (Merton College) to study law, and also became a barrister. Dove was called up into the Army Service Corps in November 1916, originally as a trainee motor vehicle driver, but after joining the Royal Tank Corps as a dispatch rider, he was sent to France in 1917 where he fought in the Battle of Cambrai, one of the bloodiest battles of World War I. He was injured during the fighting and subsequently was awarded the Military Medal for his bravery. After resuming service, Dove obtained a commission into the Cadet Unit of the RAF. Dove was demobilized in 1920 and returned to Oxford to continue his studies and his sporting activities, where he was not only a fine athlete, but an excellent boxer and won his boxing Blue in 1920. He then went to the Antwerpen Olympics that year, where he was beaten by the eventual heavyweight silver medalist Søren Petersen of Denmark. An accident shortly before the 1921 Varsity match prevented Dove, who was then captain of the Oxford University Boxing Club, from winning his second Blue. Although he never won an ABA title, Dove did win several regional ABA titles and was still winning them beyond the age of 48, where he dovetailed his boxing career with his work as a barrister. He later became a boxing judge and referee, and was a member of the Battersea Amateur Boxing Association.

Sklar joined the Royal Canadian Navy, but remained active in amateur competition through the 1940s and was eventually given the opportunity to represent his country the 1948 Summer Olympics.

45190,John Devitt,Male,4 February 1937,185.0,85, Australia,AUS,"John Devitt was a great swimmer whose career was somewhat tainted by all the controversy surrounding his 1960 Olympic 100 m freestyle victory. At Roma, the pre-Games favorite to 100 m freestyle gold was American Jeff Farrell, but he had an emergency appendectomy just six days before the US Olympic Trials and only qualified for relay duty, which left Devitt a favorite for the Olympic gold, along with reigning Olympic champion Australian Jon Henricks and Brazilian Manuel dos Santos were also considered as favorites. The fastest times in the heats and semifinals were produced by American Lance Larson, but as a butterfly specialist, he was considered an outside contender. In the Olympic final, dos Santos started the fastest and led at 50 metres, with Devitt and Larson equal second at the turn. Dos Santos faded over the last 50 metres and Devitt came on with a rush. Larson also closed, but more slowly, catching Devitt again at about 80 metres. It appeared to most observers that Larson barely out-touched Devitt, although the result was very close. The 1960 Olympics were held in the days prior to automatic timing so the final standings were decided by finish judges who relied on their eyes and did not use replays. There were three first-place judges and three second-place judges. Of the three first-place judges, they were split, 2-1, favoring Devitt. The three second-place judges also favored Devitt for second, by 2-1. Therefore, the six judges were split, 3-3, in terms of who won. There were three official timers in 1960 for each lane and swimmer, all timing by hand. All three timers for Devitt, in lane three, gave him 55.2 seconds. The three timers for lane four had Larson in 55.0, 55.1, and 55.1 seconds; thus timing seemed to favor Larson, as did back-up unofficial electronic timing. After a long delay, the chief judge, Henry Runströmer of Sweden cast the deciding vote and declared Devitt the winner. He ruled that Larson would be given the time of 55.2 seconds. However, the rules at that time did not provide for the chief judge to have a vote or give him the right to break ties. This led to numerous protests by the American team shortly after the final and even years after the Olympics. The results were never changed, but the result of the controversy was that FINA decided that automatic timing was a necessity to avoid such problems in the future, and since the 1968 Olympics, all international swim races have been timed electronically. Devitt also won 4x200 m freestyle relay bronze at the 1960 Olympics. Devitt first competed internationally at the 1956 Olympics, where he lost a closely fought battle against a fellow countryman Henricks in the 100 freestyle and settled for silver. Devitt also won gold in the 4x200 free relay in a world record time of 8:23.6. Between the Olympics, Devitt competed at the 1958 British Empire and Commonwealth Games, where he won golds in 110 yd freestyle, 4x220 yd freestyle relay, and medley relay. Besides his first world record, set at the 1956 Olympics, Devitt also set two 100 m freestyle world records by clocking 55.2 on 19 January 1957 and then 54.6 nine days later. He was part of an Australian 4x100 free relay team that set a world record of 3:46.3 in 1958 and 4x100 medley relay teams that set two world records of 4:14.2 and 4:10.4 in the summer of 1958. Devitt retired from sports after the 1960 Olympics and began working for Speedo, an Australian manufacturer of swimwear and swim-related accessories. He rose from a salesman to become the European manager, and later international manager. He was also an editor of the magazine International Swimming in that era, and in 1979 combined with Terry Gathercole to start their own aquatic equipment firm. In the 1980s, Devitt was the member of the Australian NOC executive board, was involved in Sydney’s winning bid for the 2000 Olympics, and was the Australian team manager for the 2006 Commonwealth Games.

This earned her a place on the Japanese team for the 1936 Winter Olympics. During the trip to Europe, Inada also competed in the European Championships held in Berlin prior to the Olympics, placing ninth. To participate in the Olympics in Garmisch-Partenkirchen at the age of 12, not only made her the youngest Japanese Olympian (as of 2020), but also the only female athlete representing Japan in pre-World War II Winter Olympics. Inada’s 10th place at the Olympics and the subsequent World Championships made her a rising star. Even women’s figure skating first superstar Sonja Henie predicted her a great future. She was expected to be one of the favorites for the then cancelled 1940 Winter Olympics in Sapporo. Domestically, Inada won five consecutive national titles from 1937-41 before the competitions had to be adjourned due to the Pacific War. After graduating from Umehana High School, she studied English at a vocational school and moved to Manchuria, where she continued to skate on frozen rivers. Inada lived to see the end of the war in 1945 in the Nara prefecture, and one year later she married. She worked towards a comeback but soon got divorced and did not win her seventh and final national championship before 1951. In the same year, she took part in the World Championships for the first time, after a break of 15 years. But figure skating in Japan had lost contact to the world-wide trends and Inada ended up ranking 21st out of 23. In 1952, Inada retired from competition to became a coach. She not only trained several Olympians including Miwa Fukuhara, she also taught figure skating to the imperial family. In addition, Inada opened a boutique in Tokyo’s wealthy neighborhood Aoyama. She eventually died from stomach cancer. Inada was the role model of a figure skating coach in a novel and a 2003 TV series.",

He was considered “the Bobby Orr of the Soviet Union,” and no less an authority than Wayne Gretzky called him “the best I’ve ever played against.” Fetisov began his hockey career with CSKA Moskva in 1977 and played there until 1989. With CSKA Moskva Fetisov won twelve Soviet and European Champions Cup titles in a row (1978-89). Fetisov was also named MVP of the Soviet Championships in 1982 and 1986. In 1983 Fetisov was drafted by the New Jersey Devils of the NHL but few thought he would ever play for them. However, after glasnost and perestroika, Fetisov was able to join the Devils in 1989. Past his prime by then, he was a solid, but not spectacular, player in the NHL. He played 10 NHL seasons, retiring in 1998, six with the Devils, and his final four with the Detroit Red Wings. With Detroit he won the Stanley Cup in 1997 and 1998. Internationally, besides his three Olympic medals, Fetisov was a World champion eight times (1978, 1981-83, 1986, 1989-90) and European champion nine times (1979, 1981-83, 1985-87, 1989, 1991). He also won silver (1987) and bronzes (1985, 1991) at the World Championships and two silvers (1978, 1990) at the European Championships. Fetisov was named as the best defenseman at the 1978, 1982, 1985-86 and 1989 World Championships. In 1981 Fetisov played on the winning Canada Cup team, taking silver at the 1987 Canada Cup. In 1996 Fetisov also played four games with the Russian national team, winning a bronze at the 1996 World Cup. After retiring as a player, Fetisov became an assistant coach with the New Jersey Devils from 1999-2002, winning the Stanley Cup in 2000. In 2002 Fetisov was the manager of the Russian Olympic ice hockey team. From 2002-08 Fetisov was the Minister of Sport in Russia and was later a member of the upper house of the Federal Assembly of Russia.

He was an exception among Sosaku hanga artists, most of whom worked in Tokyo. His work was noted for its forceful and distinctive use of color. Kawanishi purposely softened the edges of his forms by using a round chisel rather than a knife to carve the contours. Kawanishi came from a merchant class background and took up a career in art over his family’s objections. His son Yusaburo also became an artist. In the Official Art Catalog of 1932, he is listed with the first name as “Ei”, which is due to an incorrect transliteration. Baseball Game at Koshien was a color woodblock print measuring 33 x 43.7 cm (image) from 1932, depicting the opening ceremony of the middle school baseball tournament at Koshien Stadium near Kobe. Another woodblock print from 1932 was Football at Higashi Yuenchi Park, Kobe sized 20 x 30 cm. “Hi-gashi Yuenchi” was opened in 1868 as a sports park exclusively for foreigners. It also became known as the cradle of modern sports in Japan such as soccer and bowling. The place name “Toynen” in the title given in the 1932 art catalog could not be identified.",

The family returned to Denmark when Knudåge was only three-years-old. Riisager graduated from København University in political science, and worked in the Ministry of Finance from 1926. Simultaneously, he received a musical education in København and, from 1923, in Paris and Leipzig. Influenced by Igor Stravinsky, he composed stage and symphonic works, instrumental concertos, chamber music and songs, as well as one opera called Susanne, and several musicological writings. Riisager’s international fame was largely due to his extensive work in ballet music. The contemporary reception of his very individual work was mixed, but he was considered one of Denmark’s most important composers since the popular, and iconic, Carl Nielsen. In Denmark, Riisager was the founder of the Society of Young Composers and later president of the Association of Danish Composers. From 1956-67 he was director of the Royal Danish Academy of Music. Jabiru T-Doxe, better known as T-DOXC, a “poème mécanique” for symphony orchestra (op. 13), was composed in 1926 and was inspired by the enthusiasm of the time for marked rhythms with machine-like elements. The work is less than 9 minutes long and is available on CD. It had its première on 2 September 1927 at the Tivoli concert hall. Riisager dedicated the work to fellow composer Ebbe Hamerik. The title refers to an airplane type - Farman F.121 Jabiru - that had just been introduced into Denmark. The plane flew under the hallmark T-DOXC from 1926 to 1931.",

In 1967 she began working with Bruno Cacchi (1939-2019), who later became her husband. Pigni had difficulty with injuries in 1967-68 and was eliminated in the semi-finals of the 1968 Olympics in the 800.

In March 1970 Pigni won the Nation’s cross-country, an event that in 1973 became an official World Championship. She also won cross-country meets at Waregem in 1973 and at Monza in 1974. After the birth of her daughter Chiara in March 1971, Pigni returned in 1972.
