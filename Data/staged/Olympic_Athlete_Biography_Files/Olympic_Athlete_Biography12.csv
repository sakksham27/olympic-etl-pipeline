Ostler also won two gold medals at the 1952 Winter Games at Oslo with Nieberl in the two-man event and completed by Fritz Kuhn and Franz Kemser in the four-man event. In order to have a shot at the title, the second German four-man sled wasn’t entered, and instead the two heaviest pushers – Kuhn and Kemser – joined Ostler and Nieberl in the remaining sled. This gave the Germans a decisive advantage, as they weighed in at 472 kg (including sled), and they comfortably slid to the gold. The international bobsleigh federation (FIBT) soon afterwards decided to limit the weight for four-man teams to 420 kg. Four years later Ostler was the flagbearer at the opening ceremony at Cortina d’Ampezzo and placed eighth in the two-man event with Hans Hohenester. Ostler made his living as a restaurant proprietor.

In 1904, when still little more than a novice, he won both AAA titles, and he repeated the double the following year. Having won four AAA titles and set nine world records, Larner then decided to retire as he found that training interfered with his duties as a Brighton policeman. Fortunately, the Chief Constable of Brighton was persuaded to give Larner time off from work to train for the 1908 Olympic Games, and after a two-year absence, Larner reappeared on the track. Although he had an exceptionally long stride, Larner was generally rated as a very fair stylist and it came as no surprise when he was disqualified in his first comeback race, the AAA 7 mile Championship in April 1908. He soon redeemed himself by winning the AAA 2 mile title in July and then won both the Olympic walking titles later than month. After the Games, Larner retired again from race walking but he enjoyed some modest successes as a cross-country runner with Brighton & County Harriers and Highgate Harriers. In 1911 he made another comeback and won the AAA 7 miles title, but he did not stay in training for the 1912 Olympics.

Two years later, she broke the world record in that event. This made her the favorite in the event for the 1980 Moskva Olympics, especially as the main contender, Tracy Caulkins of the USA, was missing because of the US-led boycott of the Western countries. At the Games, Schneider lowered her own world record by a further two seconds as she took gold. She also captured a silver medal in the 400 freestyle. At the 1982 World Championships at Guayaquil (Ecuador), she lowered the mark once more. This record, 4:36.10, stood for 15 years until it was broken by China’s Chen Yan. After German re-unification it became known that Schneider’s performances should be viewed in a different light due to the systematic administration of illegal performance-enhancing substances by GDR sports officials, doctors and trainers. In 2005, Schneider revealed on German television that her record (still a European and German mark) should be scratched, as her performances were influenced by doping. Schneider was named World Swimmer of the Year in 1980 and 1982, but in 2013 Swimming World removed all awards previously awarded to East German swimmers because of the government-sanctioned systematic doping. She was inducted into the International Swimming Hall of Fame in 1989. Schneider married weightlifter Ingobert Kind and became a graduated teacher.

The help of a sports psychologist seemed to reinvigorate her performances and, in partnership with the horse Supreme Rock, she won the European Championships in 1999 as both an individual and as part of the British team. The pair were chosen for the Sydney Olympics and they returned home from Australia having been the outstanding combination for the silver medal winning team. She successfully won both European titles in 2001 but had a disappointing show at the World Equestrian Games in 2002 where she had to be satisfied with only a team bronze. This proved only to be a temporary setback and she rose to the top of the world rankings by winning all three constituent events of the Grand Slam of Eventing (Burghley, Badminton and Lexington) in 2003. This was the first time the feat had ever been achieved in the same year. Also in 2003 she added a fifth European title leading the British team and was third individually. A change to the format of the sport in time for the 2004 Olympics was not favourable to Funnell’s current crop of horses but she still won silver and bronze medal in Athens. Her fortunes have waned after 2005 as many of her best horses were retired due to age or injury. Pippa married international show jumper William Funnell in 1993 and the two also run a business breeding horses. She has written a series of children’s books and lent her name to a number of equestrian video games.",

18162,Simpson Foulis,Male,24 January 1884,,, United States,USA,"Simpson Foulis was one of five pioneering St. Andrews-born brothers who emigrated to the United States in the 1890s and became founding fathers of the game of golf in the midwest of America. The five brothers consisted of David, John, James, Robert and Simpson. Jim was the first to make the trip across the Atlantic, arriving in March 1895, when he was appointed the first professional at Chicago Golf Club, one of the oldest golf courses in the United States. Robert soon followed a few months later after obtaining a contract to design a new golf course. Dave arrived the following year and in 1899 James senior arrived with the rest of the family, including 14-year-old Simpson. James Foulis senior was the foreman in Old Tom Morris’s shop at St. Andrews and the boys all worked for their father in the shop at some time or other. James senior was recognised as one of the best club makers of the day. All brothers, except John, were golfers, although he was involved in ball making and was an accountant at Chicago golf club. Jim, Robert and Dave were all involved in golf course design. Simpson was the youngest of the five brothers and whilst at Madras College, St Andrews, he won a scratch tournament at an early age. He was the only one of the brothers not to turn professional and consequently competed in the individual match-play event at the 1904 St Louis Olympics, which was held at Glen Echo Country Club, at which his brother Robert was the professional. After two medal rounds Simpson qualified for the match-play element and in the first round beat the American Harry Potter before being eliminated in the next round by another American, Ned Sawyer. The most successful of the four brothers was Jim who finished joint-third in the inaugural US Open in 1895, and the following year captured the title at Shinnecock Hills and with it the winner’s cheque for $150. Jim and Dave were the most innovative of the five brothers. They modified the new Haskell golf ball in 1903 and invented a new club to be used with the modified ball, and so they created the mashie-niblick, equivalent to a modern-day 7–iron. They patented the club, a patent they held until 1920. They also brought the first metal hole cup liners to the United States in 1902, and as a result, they designed ‘The Foulis Flag’ that would stand upright in the new metal container. Simpson Foulis died in 1951 and like his four brothers is buried at Wheaton, Illinois. Although he was likely still a British national when he played at the 1904 Olympic golf tournament, Foulis entered the competition out of the Chicago Golf Club.",

He took part in the 1936 Olympics as a sailor in 6 metre yachts and placed 10th, while in 1948 his Olympic appearance was as a musician in the Art Competitions. He received Honorable Mention for his work Le Grand Voilier. The symphonic poem, written in 1939, was a 10-minute long composition inspired by the landscape of Brittany, where he spent a lot of time. Baudrier mainly composed symphonic music, but also chamber music, songs and cantatas and published writings on musical theory. Baudrier studied law and philosophy, before he devoted himself to music, and especially became well-known for his film soundtracks. He studied organ with Georges Loth, the organist of Sacré-Cœur in Paris, but was mostly an autodidact. In 1936, he founded the group “Jeune France” together with organist and composer Olivier Messiaen. The group, which also included André Jolivet and Jean-Yves Daniel-Lesur, followed to the late Hector Berlioz, trying to reintroduce spirituality into music. Differing styles of the members of the group led to its dissolution during World War II. After the liberation, Baudrier joined the newly founded “Institute of Advanced Film Studies” (IDHEC) as a teacher. He wrote the musical scores for films directed by René Clément, Maurice Tourneur and Jacques-Yves Cousteau, amongst others.",

Quarrie repeated his sprint double at the 1971 Pan American Games, equaling the 200 m world record of 19.8 in the final. Quarrie was one of the favorites for Olympic sprint golds at the 1972 Olympics, but a pulled muscle in a 200 semi caused him to abandon the race. In 1974, Quarrie became the first athlete to defend the sprint titles at the Commonwealth Games. In 1975, he again equaled the 200 m world record of 19.8 and equaled the 100 m world record of 9.9 at the California Relays just before the 1976 Montréal Olympics.

His best sport, however, was fencing, a sport in which he competed in three Olympics from 1906-12. With the German sabre squad, Erckrath won the title in Athens 1906, the first time Germany won an international title in fencing. He never progressed past the first round individually, however. A salesman by trade, Erckrath de Bary was one of the founders of the German Fencing Union in 1911, and served as its president until 1926. In 1913, he was also one of the godparents of the International Fencing Association (Fédération Internationale d’Escrime) and one of its vice-presidents. Together with non-Olympian Arturo Gazzera he translated Masaniello Parise’s textbook The Fencing with Épée and Sabre from Italian. In 1936, together with Erwin Casmir, he organized the fencing competitions at the Summer Olympics in Berlin. In 1937, both received the golden badge of honor from the German Fencing Association.

He participated in the 1992, 1994 and 1998 Winter Olympics with the German team but with lower success. His best results were seventh places in 1992 and 1998 in his special event, the 50 km. He also had an unfortunate fourth place in 1994 with the relay. After years of battle with the team coach, Mühlegg was suspended from the German team due to his aberrant behaviour, which included carrying and drinking from a bottle of holy water provided by his Portuguese cleaning lady. He then turned to the Spanish team, and obtained a Spanish passport on 11 November 1999. Less than a month later, he won his first ever World Cup race, and eventually he took the overall World Cup that season. In 2001, he won the 50 km at the World Championships in Lahti, adding to a silver medal in the 30 km. Heavily favoured to win Spain’s first Winter Olympic medal since 1972, Mühlegg did not disappoint in Salt Lake City, but after winning both the 30 km and the pursuit, traces of darbepoetin (an EPO-like stimulant) were found in an out of competition test. When these results were published, Mühlegg had already won his third gold, in the 50 km. He was immediately disqualified from that event, but his gold medals in the two earlier competitions were allowed to stand. It was not until December 2003 that the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) ruled that Mühlegg should also be disqualified and return his gold medals. Mühlegg retired from the sport before his suspension ended, instead publishing his autobiography: “Alone against all”. Mühlegg later settled in Brazil and was somewhat of a hermit but was discovered living there during the 2014 FIFA World Cup.","Listed in Doping Irregularities at the Olympics (2002 Salt Lake City – 10/10 km pursuit (1), 30 km (1), and 50 km.

When he was ordained a priest in 1936, it meant that he, his father and two of his brothers were all in Holy Orders in the Diocese of York. Like him, Duckworth’s two siblings went on to became Canons. Duckworth was chaplain with the Cambridgeshire Regiment during World War II, but was taken prisoner of war by the Japanese for three years following the fall of Singapore. He was incarcerated in the infamous Changi prison, but did much to raise the spirits of his fellow prisoners, and he was twice mentioned in dispatches. Having been attached to a Hull parish before the War, Duckworth was chaplain at St. John’s College, Cambridge between 1946-48, before working in the Gold Coast (now Ghana) where he became Canon of Accra. He returned to Britain shortly after Ghana’s independence in 1957, and took a post at Pocklington School in Yorkshire. From 1961-73 he was chaplain at the newly founded Churchill College, Cambridge, and he immediately set about starting their Boat Club. The club still toasts him every year, and the club always has a boat name “The Canon” in his honour. As a coxswain he won the Boat Race three times (1934-36), at a time when Cambridge were part-way through their record-breaking run of 13 consecutive victories. The victory in 1934 was in a then record time and that same year he also coxed Leander to victory in the Grand Challenge Cup at Henley, also in a record time. He won the Ladies’ Plate with his university college, Jesus to make it a notable treble in 1934. After the war Duckworth commentated on the Boat Race for the BBC and in 1959, he was the subject of the popular BBC television programme “This is Your Life”. His biography “Canon Noel Duckworth: An Extraordinary Life” by Michael Smyth was published in 2012. Despite a successful career on the water, it could have all ended before it really got started. As he once recalled that when he started as a freshman at Jesus College in 1931 and first went out as a cox, he knocked 10-foot off the end of the boat and submerged the crew. He was charged £10 for repairs but, rather than quit, he stayed on as a member of the Boat Club to, as he said: “Get my money’s worth!”","Listed in Olympians Who Competed in the Boat Race (1934 Cambridge (won), 1935 Cambridge (won), 1936 Cambridge (won))"

56922,David Rigert,Male,12 March 1947,174.0,92, Soviet Union,URS,"David Rigert was one of the greatest weightlifters ever but, at the highest level of the sport, the Olympic Games, he suffered abject failure twice. Rigert was born in a remote Kazakhstan village to a German family and took up weightlifting in 1966. Rigert rose to prominence in 1969 when he met a fellow Soviet weightlifter and renowned weightlifting coach of German origin Rudolf Plyukfelder, who invited Rigert to train under him in Shakhty, Rostov. Soon Rigert rose to be one of the greatest weightlifters of the 1970s. At his first international tournament, the 1970 World Championships, Rigert won bronze in light-heavyweight. The next year Rigert moved to middle-heavyweight and was world middle-heavyweight champion five times, in 1971 and 1973-76. Rigert later won the World title as a sub-heavyweight in 1978. Rigert won the European middle-heavyweight title seven times (1971-76, 1978) and added two more European titles in sub-heavyweight class in 1979-80. In 1972, 1976 and 1980 he was the clear favorite in his class at the Olympic Games and in 1976 he came through as expected and won the gold medal. But in both 1972 and 1980 he failed to lift a weight in three snatch attempts and was eliminated from the competition. Domestically Rigert won the Soviet middle-heavyweight title five times (1972-73, 1975-76, 1978), while taking the middle-heavyweight silver in 1971 and light-heavyweight silver in 1970. Rigert also won five Soviet CupsL one in light-heavyweight (1972), three in middle-heavyweight (1971, 1973, 1975) and one in sub-heavyweight (1979). Rigert set 68 world records during his career, four of them in light-heavyweight (two in snatch, one in clean & jerk and one in total), 50 in middle-heavyweight (one in press, 14 in snatch, 17 in clean & jerk and 18 in total), 13 in sub-heavyweight (5 in snatch, 4 in clean & jerk and 4 in total) and one in heavyweight snatch. After finishing his sporting career in 1981 Rigert became a weightlifting coach, first in Rostov and later in Taganrog. From 1985-87 Rigert was head coach of the Soviet national weightlifting team. In 2002 Rigert became head coach of the Russian national weightlifting team, serving as head coach at the 2004 Olympics. He has also manufactured weights for weightlifting competitions. In 2004 Rigert entered local politics and was elected to the Taganrog city council. He was re-elected in 2009, representing the United Russia political party. In 1999 he was elected to the International Weightlifting Federation Hall of Fame.",

Johnson took the gold medal and a narrow victory over Émile Demangel of France and the following day Johnson reached the final of the 1,000 metres sprint. The race was declared void, as the riders exceeded the time limit of 1:45 set by the judges but Johnson was already out of contention as he had punctured early in the race. Victor Johnson, who represented the Birmingham Rover CC, made his track début in 1902 and went on to win a total of six NCU titles, including three in one day in 1911, and 11 days after his Olympic triumph he won the world amateur sprint championship in Leipzig. In one season alone, 1907, Johnson won a staggering 29 races. He also set three world and numerous British records and his best performance against the watch was a time of 28.0 seconds for the quarter-mile, standing start (unpaced) at Herne Hill in 1909. This remained a world record for 21 years until it was superseded by a slower time when the international regulations changed. His 2:03.4 for the one-mile, standing start (unpaced) at Crystal Palace in 1907 also stood as a record for 22 years.

The land was inherited by his two surviving sons, William Daly and his younger brother Denis, who later sold it to the Land Commission. Neither Denis nor William could inherit the title of Baron Dunsandle and Clanconal on their father’s death in 1893 as their parents were not married at the time of their birth. Denis Daly served with the 18th Hussars, where he most probably learned polo in India, until his retirement from the army in 1893. At the age of 52, Daly re-joined the army on the outbreak of World War I and served as a major in the Army Remount Department.

Things changed when they were only eight years old, however, when they discovered synchronized swimming. By the age of twelve they had joined CAMO Natation, one of Montreal’s premiere swimming clubs, and they earned their first junior national titles in 1977: Penny won the solo event, Vicky captured the figures crown, and together they were victorious in the duet. They reversed this feat in 1978: in addition to winning the duet, Vicky captured the solo event and Penny was victorious in the figures. They earned their first senior title in the duet in 1980, with taking silver (Vicky) and bronze (Penny) in the solo event, in addition to Vicky’s bronze in the figures. They defended the duet crown in 1981, as well as coming in second (Vicky) and third (Penny) in the solo event, but were defeated in the duet in 1982 by Kelly Kryczka and Sharon Hambrook. At that completion, Vicky and Penny were third and fourth respectively in the figures and the solo event. They abandoned the solo discipline in 1983 to focus on the duet and took back the title at that year’s Canadian Championships, which made them Canada’s representatives in the discipline at the 1983 Pan American Games. There they won silver behind Americans Tracie Ruiz-Conforto and Candy Costie, in addition to gold in the team event. Nonetheless, the Vilagos twins were defeated in the Olympic trials by Hambrook and Kryczka, who went on to earn silver in the duet at the 1984 Summer Games. The sisters disappeared from the public eye after retiring from active competition in the mid-1980s, but came back in a big way in 1992 when, after less than two years of training, they qualified to represent Canada at that year’s Summer Olympics.

A winger or inside-forward, it was with Burnley that he achieved his greatest fame. Although he was on their books for 12 years he only played peacetime football in the first three seasons after the war, and most of his 32 League appearances and six goals came in the 1946-47 season when he helped Burnley back into the first division and also to the FA Cup Final. To crown a memorable season he was selected for the full England team to play France in May 1947 which would have made him the first amateur full international since 1927, but illness forced him to withdraw and he never went on to play in a full international. He was however selected for the 1948 Olympics and played in three of Britain’s four matches. The son of a wealthy Burnley mill owner, Frank signed for Liverpool on amateur forms in 1949 but played just one game for them, in a 1-0 win over Birmingham City on 12 March 1949. In the Liverpool team that day were Billy Liddell and Bob Paisley. After leaving Liverpool he spent most of the remainder of his career with Yorkshire Amateurs before retiring in 1956.

57,Dorothy Lambert Chambers,Female,3 September 1878,,, Great Britain,GBR,"As all the foreign entrants withdrew from the women’s singles at the 1908 Olympics, the field eventually consisted of five British players. Dora Boothby drew a series of byes into the final where she met Dolly Lambert Chambers and won a silver medal for losing the only match she played. Lambert Chambers and Boothby met again many times after the Olympic final, the most notable re-match being in the 1911 Wimbledon final when Lambert Chambers won 6-0, 6-0, and Dora Boothby earned the unenviable distinction of being the only Wimbledon singles finalist who has failed to win a single game. Dorothea Douglass was born and raised in Ealing, where her father was the vicar of St. Matthew’s Church, and she was educated locally at Princess Helena College where she took up the game of tennis. As the 1900 Olympic champion, Charlotte Cooper, also came from the same neighborhood, the Olympic title returned to Ealing in 1908 with Dorothea’s victory. Before her marriage to Robert Lambert Chambers in 1907 she won three Wimbledon singles championships and was to win four more as a married woman. Her total of seven Wimbledon singles victories has only been surpassed by Helen Wills and Martina Navratilova and had it not been for the interruption caused by the war it is not unreasonable to assume that Lambert Chambers would have won further honors. In fact, she very nearly claimed an eighth title in 1919 when she held two match points against Suzanne Lenglen. She also lost the 1920 final to Lenglen. In 1927, at the age of 48, Dolly Lambert Chambers played at Wimbledon for the last time and the following year became a professional coach. During the course of her outstanding playing career she had, in addition to her seven Wimbledon singles title, won the All-England women’s doubles in 1903 and 1904 and the mixed doubles in 1903 and 1906. Hence, in 1903 she became the first woman to win all three titles at the All-England Championships. The talent of this great sportswoman was not confined to the tennis courts and she won two All-England badminton titles and played hockey for Middlesex.",

A Jamaican-born athlete, Bailey moved to Canada in 1981 but did not begin sprinting competitively until a decade later. At this point he possessed an economics degree and was nurturing a budding career in finance. His first major international competition came at the 1995 World Championships, where he won gold medals in the 100m event and the 4×100 relay. A shoo-in for the 1996 Summer Olympics, he continued to impress during the lead-up by setting a world record time of 5.56 in the 50 m, one that still stands as of 2012 and has only been tied once, by Maurice Greene in 1999. At the Games he immediately became a household name after winning the 100m competition in a record-breaking time of 9.84 seconds and taking home gold in the 4×100 relay as well. His world record would stand for three years (broken by Greene in 1999), his Commonwealth record lasted until 2005 (bested by Asafa Powell), and his Olympic record stood until 2008 (eclipsed by Usain Bolt), although he remained the Canadian record holder in the event, tied with Bruny Surin. On the national scene he further cemented his fame by defeating American Michael Johnson in an unofficial 150m “World’s Fastest Man” competition in 1997. Bailey continued to compete through 1997, winning silver in the 100 m event and gold in the 4×100 m relay at that year’s World Championships, but soon thereafter damaged his Achilles tendon during a 1998 recreational basketball match. He did participate in the 2000 Summer Olympics, but was eliminated in the quarter-finals of the 100 and retired in 2001. A two-time member of the Canadian Hall of Fame, inducted as an individual in 2004 and as a member of the 1996 relay team in 2008, he was presented with the Lou Marsh Trophy, given annually to Canada’s best sportsperson, in 1996.

Collins was the first-pick in the 1973 NBA draft – by the Philadelphia 76ers – and a great NBA career was predicted for him. Collins played for nine years in the NBA and undoubtedly had a good career. However, the greatness predicted for him never emerged, held back by a never-ending string of injuries. At his best he was one of the top guards in the NBA. Doug Collins later coached in both college and the NBA, also became a well-known basketball commentator on television.

In the war, Rawson served as a captain in the Royal Engineers and achieved the rare distinction of winning two bars to the Military Cross. After the war he joined the Polytechnic BC and in his first experience of open competition he won the novices heavyweight class at a tournament in January 1920. Within three months he was the ABA champion and within seven months he was an Olympic gold medalist. At the Antwerp Olympics in August, Rawson added his reputation as a devastating puncher with none of his opponents succeeding in lasting the scheduled three rounds. He won the final with a second round KO of Søren Petersen of Denmark. In 1921, after winning a second ABA title Rawson retired having been in top class amateur boxing for little more than year. Since his first open contest as a novice in January 1920 he had taken part in 28 flights and won 27 of them by a KO.

2000593,Aloys Fleischmann,Male,13 April 1910,,, Ireland,IRL,"Aloys Fleischmann was born to German parents based in Ireland. Both were musicians and graduates of the Royal Academy of Music in München. Fleischmann graduated from University College Cork in 1930 with a BA, followed by a master’s degree in 1932. He then continued his studies in composition, conducting and musicology in München. In 1934 he returned to the University College in Cork, where he taught as a professor until 1980. In 1963 he received a doctorate from the National University of Ireland. Throughout his career Fleischmann initiated projects to establish music as part of people’s lives as well as in education. As a connoisseur of Irish folk music, he tried to create a specifically Irish form of classical music in his compositions. As a conductor of well-known Irish orchestras, he included as many works by Irish composers as possible in his concert programs and directed the Cork International Choral Festival, for which he also commissioned new works. The Fleischmann Choir was later named after him. Fleischmann’s work of a lifetime was the book Sources of Irish Traditional Music, which, however, was only published posthumously. In 1991 he was made an honorary member of the Royal Irish Academy of Music and received honorary membership in the Royal Dublin Society. In 2010, numerous events were held in Ireland and around the world to Fleischmann’s 100th birthday. His three songs, submitted in 1952 but composed as early as in 1935, have both Irish and English titles and lyrics: Marbhna Eoghain Ruaidh Uí Néill/Lament for Owen Roe O’Neill, Bíogadh/Away! and An Píobaire/The Piper. Even in these early works Fleischmann tried to express the spirit of Irish folk poetry. He himself was the conductor at the premiere of the orchestral version in 1938 at the Gaiety Theatre in Dublin. Lament for Owen Roe O’Neill is a setting of a poem by O’Carolan (1670–1738), lamenting the death of Irish General Owen Roe O’Neill (ca. 1585-1649). Away! is an adaptation of a medieval poem and The Bagpiper is a poem, both written by contemporary poet Micheál Ó Murchú (1918-1990).",

At the age of 16, Clive got a job as a clerk in the Post Office, before later working in their Savings Bank Department in London. A keen athlete, he started as a sprinter with the Polytechnic Harriers before turning to the high jump in 1909. The following year, because of birth eligibility, he won the Northern Counties high jump title, but was then beaten by Howard Baker at that year’s AAAs Championships. Baker also beat Taylor into second place in 1912. After the Stockholm Olympics, Taylor reverted to serious sprinting again, and at Stamford Bridge on 13 September 1913 was a member of the 8-man Polytechnic Harriers team, along with Willie Applegarth, that broke the world mile relay record with a time of 2:59.0. in the last AAAs before World War I, in 1914, Taylor lost by inches to Applegarth in the 100 yards final. Taylor and Applegarth were the only two non-Americans on the list of the world’s fastest men over 100 yards in 1914. During the War, Taylor served with the Royal Fusiliers as a second lieutenant and in November 1916 was severely injured in action in France. He was hospitalized for three months before succumbing to his injuries in February 1917. He was awarded the Military Cross for conspicuous gallantry in action just days before his death.",

The New Zealanders won three of the seven races and their closest rivals, the Australians, won two, giving Mander and Cropp the gold medal on a countback. They thought they’d won the silver when they were second in the final race, but the Australian skipper, Rolly Tasker, had been disqualified and the two rival countries ended with an equal number of points. It was the greater number of wins for Mander and Cropp that made the difference. It was fitting that Mander skippered the winning boat because he had been instrumental in forming the New Zealand Yachting Federation, a pre-requisite to being accepted in the Olympics.",

Eleven days later he won a second gold in the 4,000 metres freestyle with an even more resounding victory, finishing about 11 minutes ahead of the Hungarian Zoltán von Halmay. The fact that both races were swam with the benefit of the downstream current in the River Seine made a significant contribution to the fast times recorded. Jarvis won three more medals at the 1906 Games in Athens and made his third and final Olympic appearance in 1908. By this time he was 36-years-old and, after winning his heat in the 1,500 metre freestyle, he failed to finish the semi-final. Between 1897 and 1906 Jarvis won 24 ASA swimming titles representing Leicester SC, and in 1904 he was also the plunging champion. He won 108 major international races using a right overarm sidestroke with a special kick he had developed with Joey Nuttall, a leading professional of the time. This effective technique, known as the Jarvis-Nuttall Kick, enabled Jarvis to set many world records although none were ever so officially recognized by FINA. Jarvis was also a water polo international for 11 years, from 1894 to 1904. After his retirement from competitive swimming, Jarvis devoted himself to life saving techniques and was respectfully referred to as “Professor” Jarvis. He personally saved many lives including a well-publicized rescue when he brought in twin sisters. His sister Clara was chaperone to the British women’s swimming team at the 1912 Olympics and three of his daughters, all swimming teachers, went to Florida in 1968 to represent their father at his posthumous introduction into the Swimming hall of Fame at Fort Lauderdale.",

69436,Jack Rimmer,Male,27 April 1878,177.0,51, Great Britain,GBR,"As the runners in the steeplechase at the 1900 Olympics had to contend with stone fences, a water jump, hurdles and other obstacles, Great Britain was well served by the cross-country experience of her representatives. There were two steeplechase events in Paris, the 2,500 metres event being held first, with the race over 4,000 metres scheduled for the following day. Unlike most of the leading contenders, John Rimmer did not start in the shorter event and went to the post for the 4,000 metres race fresher than the majority of the field. The British trio of Rimmer, Charles Bennett, and Sidney Robinson came home virtually together, but it was Rimmer who caught the judges’ eye and was awarded first place with just two seconds separating the three runners. Rimmer, a Liverpool policeman for 30 years who began his athletic career with Sefton Harriers, of whom he later became President, before joining Southport Harriers, later won a second gold medal in the 5,000 metres team race in which he himself finished second. He was second in the AAA 10 miles for three successive years from 1899 behind three great distance runners, Charles Bennett, Sidney Robinson and Alf Shrubb respectively. His only win at these championships came at Stamford Bridge in 1901 1900 when he won the 4 miles. Jack Rimmer won races at distances from 100 yards to 25 miles and was still running for Sefton beyond the age of 50.

In contrast a rich vein of form which included a European title and a bronze at the world Championship meant they were considered as one of the favourites for the Athens Olympics. They eventually won silver medals after being contenders for the gold right up until the final race. Rogers and Glanfield were silver medal winners at both the European and World Championships in 2006 then added a second Olympic silver in Beijing before ending their partnership in 2009.

920162,Pierre De Soete,Male,1886,,, Belgium,BEL,"Pierre de Soete is considered one of the leading sculptors of the early 20th century in Belgium. Orphaned at an early age, he enrolled at the Molenbeek Academy of Design but was a largely self-taught sculptor. De Soete created sculptures and public monuments and the mascot for the Belgian car manufacturer Minerva. In 1927 he travelled to the United States to compete in the Gordon Bennett Cup ballooning competition. There, he met American architect Whitney Warren, with whom he restored, for instance, the library of the University of Louvain, which had been damaged by German artillery in World War I. He engraved the controversial caption proposed by Warren: “Furore Teutonico Diruta; Dono Americano Restituta” (destroyed by German fury, restored by American generosity), which, however, was never installed. The 44 cm high bronze figure Taking of the Olympic Oath, also known as Le sportif or Champion, was apparently the basis for two large statues, Mens sana in corpore sano in the district Laeken of Bruxelles near the Heizel-Stadium and one in Schaerbeek for the victims of early automobile sports. The Olympic Salute is probably the Belgique l’athlète vainqueur (Athletic Winner from Belgium) of 1922, a 43.5 cm high bronze. In 1923, the trophy Vers la Victoire (Towards Victory) was created, which was dedicated to the Belgian racers Leopold and Robert Guelis, friends of De Soete. The work was 92 cm long and 38 cm high. Also made of bronze is the 34.5 x 33 cm Joueur de tennis (Tennis player) on a marble block. Only one picture in the catalog of the exhibition is available of the Étude lancement de poids (Study: shot put). Two similar versions do exist of the Boxer, but only one is called Étude de boxeur (Study of a Boxer). It is 20 cm high plus 11 cm for the pedestal. Le vainqueur, buste (The Winner, bust) was created in 1924. He also appears under the title Caesar, bust. The bronze head is - without pedestal - 23 cm high. The Grande plaquette “Vainqueur” (Great plaque “Winner”) was re-cast several times for various occasions until the 1940s. The bronze material was coated with various metals.",

79118,Lewis Tewanima,Male,1888,160.0,51, United States,USA,"Lewis Tewanima was a Hopi Indian, born as Tsökahovi Tewanima, who was born on the reservation in Arizona. He later reflected on his childhood, describing that he and his friends would often run 65 miles to Winslow, Arizona, to watch the trains. They would do that, and then run home. He dismissed the lengthy runs by noting, “It was summertime, the days were long.” Lewis Tewanima spent all but five years of his long life on the Hopi Indian Reservation. In 1906, U.S. troops arrested a band of Hopi in a dispute over a federal decree that they send their children to government-run schools. When the Hopi resisted, several were shipped away from the reservation. Tewanima was first sent to Fort Wingate in New Mexico and in 1907 to Carlisle Indian School, where he was a teammate of Jim Thorpe’s on the track team. At Carlisle, Tewanima starred on the track team, winning numerous distance races, and eventually making the Olympic team twice. He competed for the United States as a distance runner at both the 1908 and 1912 Olympic Games. In 1908, Tewanima finished 9th in the Olympic marathon. In 1912, he also ran the marathon, finishing 16th, having earlier won the silver medal in the 10,000 meters behind the legendary Finn, Hannes Kolehmainen. This was to remain the best performance by a USA athlete in this event until Billy Mills, also of Native American descent, won the 10,000 in 1964. Tewanima ran the Boston Marathon once, in 1909, leading for 18 miles, but he failed to finish. In 1954, Tewanima was picked for the all-time USA Olympic track & field team. He was brought from his home in Shimopavy, Arizona, on the reservation, to the Waldorf-Astoria in New York. There, in full Hopi regalia, he was the hit of the show, and was photographed with two-time Olympic decathlon champion Bob Mathias. In 1957, he was inducted into the Arizona Sports Hall of Fame. Tewanima returned to his Hopi home after the 1912 Olympics and spent his life herding sheep, and growing corn, melons, and beans. He remains a legend to the Hopi People, and every Labor Day, they hold the Louis Tewanima Memorial Footrace in his honor (his name is seen spelled variously Lewis or Louis, although Lewis is more common). A Hopi high school track coach has noted, “Tewanima is a cultural hero to all Hopi but especially to young runners.” And tribal chairman Ivan Sydney said, “When we recall Tewanima, we’re reemphasizing running as part of our identity. It’s a source of pride, and it provides a sense of unity. We can’t afford to forget.” Lewis Tewanima died from a tragic fall. He had attended a religious ceremony during the day and was walking back to his home that night, when he got lost, and plunged from a 70-foot cliff.

His older brother Hakutei Ishii was a well-known artist, working mostly as a painter and lithographer. When he was 12 years old, Tsuruzo’s father died and he was adopted by a relative, who was a farmer in Funabashi. Ishii returned to his home in 1905, where he studied painting and sculpture at the Tokyo School of Fine Arts, becoming well-known in Japan for his paintings and sculptures. To get relief from a lung disease he started to climb Japanese mountains and was inspired by their beauty. He continued his studies and won the first prize at the 5th Bunten Exhibition in 1912 for his Arakawa bamboo. In 1915 he was recommended for the Japanese Art Academy and won further prizes for his watercolors at Nika Exhibitions.

Having won silver medals in the 100, 200 and 4x100 metres relay at the 1963 Pan American Games, she then became the first Cuban to reach an Olympic sprint final when she finished fifth in the 100 metres at the 1964 Tokyo Games. She won the sprint relay gold, and added silver and bronze in the two individual sprints, at the 1967 Pan Am Games and in 1968, along with Marlene Elejarde, Fulgencia Romay and Violeta Quesada won a silver medal in the relay at the Mexico City Olympics. In addition to her Olympic and Pan Am successes, Cobián also won five gold and three silver medals at the three Central American and Caribbean Games between 1962-70, including the 100 metres gold at three consecutive Games. As of the 2018 Games, she remains the only woman to have performed this feat. She also won two silver and three bronze medals at the Summer Universiade, in 1963 and 1965.

She then worked coaching youngsters and also higher standard athletes until her retirement. In 2005 she was inducted into the Central American and Caribbean Confederation Hall of Fame.

Hans studied architecture at the Zürich ETH and continued his studies at the Technical University in Karlsruhe and in München. After graduating in Karlsruhe, he worked as an architect for four years after graduation. Schöchlin won the gold medal in the coxed pairs with his brother Karl and 13-year-old cox Hans Bourquin at the 1928 Amsterdam Olympics. Both brothers also won the 1922 Europeans in the double sculls. They then moved to the coxed eights, placing second at the 1923 and 1924 Europeans, and winning the title in 1925. In the next two years they moved to the coxed fours and won silver medals at the 1926 and 1927 Europeans. In 1930 and 1931, they won another two silvers with the coxless fours. In 1932, Hans became a member of the Swiss Olympic Committee. As a writer, Hans took part in the 1936 Olympics in the mixed literature event of the arts competition with the work Geist und Sport (Mind and Sports), a small pamphlet that was written as a philosophic novel. It included reflections on the sport in general and some biographical details of his own sports career. In 1944 he attended the “Congress of Sports Psychology” in Lausanne. During the two world wars, Schöchlin was deployed to the border guard and completed his military career as an infantry captain. As early as 1920, he was hired as a teacher of drawing classes at the Bau- und Kunstgewerbeschule des Kantonalen Technikums (Building and Arts and Crafts School of the Cantonal Technical College). For more than 12 years, he also taught art history, with an emphasis on decorative and applied arts. In 1932, he was appointed director of the Cantonal Technical School. After the war, he founded a woodworking school as a new department, retiring in 1958. From 1928 to 1948, Schöchlin was a member of the Biel City Council, including several years as its president. In this capacity, and as president of the development association, he supported the construction of the Magglingen sports center. As an architect, he was also a member of the committee for the architectural competition from which Werner Schindler and Edy Knupfer emerged as the winners. The design of the “Swiss Federal Sports and Gymnastics Training Centre”, shown based on plans and a large model at the Olympic architecture competition in London, won the silver medal.

Ansingh herself had studied in Amsterdam and was a member of the so-called Amsterdamse Joffers, which included Marie van Altena Regteren, Coba Ritsema, Ans van den Berg, Jacoba Surie, Nelly Bodenheim, Betsy Westendorp-Osieck, and Jo Bauer-Stumpff. The importance of this group was primarily to function as role models for younger women painters in the Netherlands, especially during and after the 1970s. In addition to portraits, Lizzy Ansingh was well-known for the painting of dolls, and also wrote two children’s books. In 1935 she was made a Knight of the Order of Orange-Nassau. In Sport in Beeld, the reviewer wrote about her painting: the “already sentenced to death Steeplechase by Lizzy Ansingh, a work, which has only this one value to show how little understanding some artists have of the subjects with which they are dealing.” Less critical was De Groene Amsterdammer the same year, “So much innocent gaiety spent in such an orderly chaos of shapes and colors disarms all knowledgeable criticism.”",

Subsequently the Sports Association hired Australian coach Billy Tingle, who lived in China, to prepare them during a training camp in Shanghai. Jin’s bout at the Olympics against Briton Richard Shrimpton ended in a controversial decisive win of the European. The referee counted out Jin but one of the judges protested that Shrimpton had thrown a punch too soon after coming out of a clinch and he was disqualified. British officials objected and the decision was overruled. After returning from Europe, all four Chinese boxers fought in the Sino-Japanese war and died in action. During the defense of Anyang in Henan province in late 1937, the Chinese army suffered particularly from the superior technology of the Japanese tanks.

But his first Olympic Games, Albertville 1992, was a disaster for Bredesen. He had just changed his technique from classical to V-style, and ended up last on the normal hill and next-to-last on the big hill. But Bredesen came back strongly. At the 1993 World Championships in Falun he won on the big hill, in addition to winning another gold in the team event. He ended the season with three victories in the World Cup. His success continued in 1994, winning the opening World Cup event in Planica, after which he was the overall winner of the Four Hills Tournament, climbing to the top of the rostrum both at Garmisch-Partenkirchen and Bischofshofen. At the 1994 Lillehammer Games, Bredesen won gold on the normal hill in addition to a silver medal on the big hill. He was the overall World Cup winner in 1994, the peak of his career. He produced a world record when he jumped 209 m at Planica in March 1994, which he surpassed three years later, jumping 210 m again in Planica. In the autumn 1994 Bredesen had a severe neck injury during trampoline training, and this injury affected him for the rest of his career. His last World Cup win came at Falun in 1995. He won nine national championships titles in the period 1991-98, and ended his career by placing 19th in the 2000 Norwegian championships on the normal hill. Bredesen later worked as an expert ski jumping commentator for Norwegian TV.","Bearer of the Olympic Flag at the opening ceremony of the 2016 Winter Youth Olympics Listed in Olympians Who Were Awarded the Holmenkollmedaljen (1994) Listed in Olympians Who Were on the Podium at the Four Hills Tournament (1993/94 Total winner, Oberstdorf second, Garmisch-Partenkirchen winner, Bischofshofen winner; 1995/96 Garmisch-Partenkirchen second, Bischofshofen second) Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the World Nordic Ski Championships (2–0–0 1993 Falun SJP gold: large hill and team) Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the World Ski Flying Championships (0–1–0 1994 Planica silver: individual)"

98401,Luvsansharavyn Tsend,Male,11 July 1940,178.0,68, Mongolia,MGL,"Arguably Mongolia’s most prominent speed skater of all time, Luvsansharavyn Tsend started humbly: his first skates were self made from discarded pieces of a saw tied to his shoes. He later got to use proper skates. He first appeared internationally in the 1962 season, making his first of three World Championship appearances. He also was part of the first ever Mongolian speed skating team at the Olympics in Innsbruck 1964, where a 25th place in the 10,000 m was his best performance. Tsend would come back for two more Olympics in 1968 and 1972, although he placed last in both his distances in 1972. Of note, Tsend was selected as the Mongolian flag bearer in the opening ceremony for each of his Olympic appearances. After winning his fourth Mongolian allround title in 1974 (adding to 1964, 1969-70), Tsend suffered a serious injury in 1976. When the bus he rode on crashed, his leg would not stop bleeding. After months in the hospital, Tsend was sent to the Soviet Union, where it was discovered he suffered from Hemophilia B - the first ever person with that diagnosis in Mongolia. Affected by his injuries, Tsend did not continue skating, but instead switched to coaching. He was a long time member of the national team coaching staff, making appearances in Albertville 1992 and in World Championships as late as 2008. Even after his retirement, he remained attached to the Mongolian Skating Federation as an advisor. Personal Bests: 500 – 42.1 (1971); 1500 – 2:14.9 (1971); 5000 – 7:59.8 (1969); 10000 – 16:10.2 (1970).",
920099,Herbert von Reyl,Male,28 April 1898,,, Austria,AUT,"Herbert von Reyl’s father was an officer in the Army, which allowed Herbert to travel the world, including through the cities of Krakow and Praha, where he was inspired artistically. In his youth he experienced the break-up of the Danube Monarchy, to which he felt connected by his upbringing and origin. In 1916, Reyl-Hanisch served in the artillery of the Austro-Hungarian Empire but, due to a bad lung condition, he was exempted from further military service. After his father was killed in action during World War I, Herbert von Reyl-Hanisch studied in Wien (Vienna) at the Academy of Fine Arts from 1917, and became a member of the Wiener Secession. In 1934 he moved from Wien to Bregenz and became a member of the conservative artists’ association “Alte Welt”. Von Reyl quickly rebelled against the establishment and the Nazis. He regarded industrialization as a kind of destruction of the human and also a promotion of aggression. Von Reyl mainly painted landscapes and portraits, and illustrated books and was also active as a writer. His style was considered a mix of New Objectivity and Magic Realism. He combined neo-romantic influences with a critique of civilization; his portrayals of workers were particularly numerous. In 1937 he died of severe hemoptysis (coughing up blood). The oil painting The Youth Champion, painted in 1936, was also published as a Third Reich postcard. It shows Reyl’s nephew Bernhard Matt (1920-1976), who was to become a local officer of the Hitler Youth.",
15538,Johnnie Matthews,Male,16 August 1884,177.0,67, Great Britain,GBR,"At the time of the 1908 Olympics, Johnnie Matthews of Marlborough AC and Polytechnic CC and Arthur Rushen of Putney CC were a new and untried tandem pairing and their defeat of the well-tuned German brothers, Max Götze and Bruno Götze, was one of the surprises of the Games. The Olympic final was postponed by one day as the program had fallen far behind schedule and the British pair objected to riding in semi-darkness. Their protest proved to be well justified as, in daylight, they beat the Germans by 20 yards. On their return from Athens, Matthews and Rushen won the NCU tandem title, the only national championship that either of them ever won, and they set a number of British records. The best of these, a time of 49.2 seconds for the half-mile standing start (unpaced) remained on the books for many years. For the 1908 Olympics, Matthews teamed up with the great Leon Meredith and Rushen joined John Barnard, who later married Matthews’ sister, but neither pair reached the Olympic final. The partnership between Matthews and Meredith was not a happy one; they disagreed over tactics at the Olympics and at the world championships in München shortly after the Games, and Meredith left Matthews without a ride when he withdrew from the tandem event in order to concentrate on the 100 km. race. At the last minute, George Summers stood in for Meredith and Matthews and Summers took the world title, although the 1908 tandem event is not always recognized as an official world championship. Summers and Matthews had never ridden together before and were never to do so again. After his retirement from cycling, Johnnie Matthews gave up his work as a carpenter and took over a cyclists’ tea house at Cippenham, near Slough, which became a popular meeting place for London club cyclists. He later became a publican in Kent before finally retiring in 1944.",Brother-in-law of John Barnard

After years of deliberation Thorpe was finally reinstated as the sole winner of the gold medal in 2022. Two Swedish athletes, Hugo Wieslander and Charles Lomberg were declared as joint-winners of the silver medal, with Holmér winning the bronze medal, despite finishing in fourth place. At the Stockholm Olympics Holmér also finished in eighth place in the pentathlon and competed in the qualification round in the high jump. After World War I Holmér returned to the Olympics for the 1920 Antwerpen Games where again he finished in fourth place in the decathlon, but this time there was no controversy over the results. He also ran in the 110 metres hurdles where he was eliminated in his heat. In Sweden Holmér won ten national titles across three disciplines with victory in the pentathlon (1912–13, 1915, 1917, 1920), the decathlon (1913, 1917–19), and the 110 metres hurdles (1913). He also won two bronze medals in the hurdles (1917, 1920), and a bronze in the pentathlon (1918).

69394,Gordon Pirie,Male,10 February 1931,188.0,65, Great Britain,GBR,"Gordon Pirie was unique in British athletics in the 1950s as he became the sport’s first full-time athlete. He gave up a good career in banking to concentrate on his sporting career, and it came at a time when athletes in Britain received no financial support. Known as “Puff-puff”, because he was famous for puffing out his cheeks in time to his running stride, Pirie was outspoken and courted controversy with the media and athletics authorities throughout his career. He still became an outstanding distance runner, however, who went on to break five world records, set 22 British records at distances ranging from 2000 to 10,000 metres, and won many British cross-country and AAA titles. Unfortunately Pirie never won a major international title. He appeared in three Olympics between 1952-60, winning just one medal, a 5000 metres silver at the Melbourne Games, when he was involved in a classic encounter, and finished second to the Soviet runner Vladimir Kuts. Pirie also won a 5000 bronze at the 1958 European Championships in Stockholm. At the British Empire and Commonwealth Games in Cardiff that same year, he could only finish fourth in both the 1 mile and 3 miles. Pirie set five world records throughout his career including three in three months in 1956. He firstly beat Kuts to knock 3.8 seconds off the 5000 metres record and he followed that by twice lowering the 3000 record to 7:55.5 and 7:52.7 respectively. Pirie had earlier set world records at 6 miles and the 4x1500 relay, both in 1953. On home soil, Pirie won the English Cross-Country Championship three times between 1953-55. He also won six senior AAA titles, at 6 miles in 1951-53 and 1960, and 3 miles in 1953 and 1961. He was also the first winner of the Emsley Carr Mile in 1953. Pirie emigrated to New Zealand in 1957 only to return to get himself onto the British team for the 1960 Rome Olympics. He failed to reach the 5000 metres final, however, and returned to New Zealand the following year. He eventually settled back in England in 1987, in the Lymington area of Hampshire, where he died at the age of 60 in 1991. During his time in New Zealand, Pirie introduced the sport of orienteering to the country, having himself been introduced to it by steeplechaser John Disley some years earlier. Pirie won the British Orienteering Championship in its first two years, 1967 and 1968. He represented both Britain and New Zealand at the World Championships, competing in his last one in his late 40s. Pirie was the 1955 BBC Sports Personality of the Year after beating the four-time Olympic gold medallist Emil Zátopek three times over 5000 and 10,000 metres that year. Once when asked about the most memorable race of his career, he replied that it was a race when he was at school and broke five minutes for the mile for the first time. Perhaps strangely, Pirie only once ran a sub-four-minute mile (3:59.9), at Dublin in 1960, when finishing third behind the Australian Herb Elliott and Zimbabwe’s Terry Sullivan.

Richards is the only man in history to win two Olympic gold medals in the pole vault, and these came after an Olympic bronze in 1948. Unlike many champions in this event, he was not an outstanding collegiate athlete, and while at Illinois, his best placing at the NCAA meet came in 1947 when he was in a six-way tie for first. However, he went on to win the AAU title a record nine times and won eight AAU indoor crowns. He was also Pan American Games champion in 1951 and 1955. Richards was also a top decathlete, winning the AAU title three times and the All-Around Championship once. In the 1955 Pan American Games decathlon he won the silver medal. In 1956 he made the Olympic team in the decathlon but, hampered by an injury, did not finsh. Richards later became a familiar face on TV.

It led to a gold medal in the Olympics in his only serious year of competition in the sport. After his Naval Academy graduation in 1931, Benny Bass served in the navy until 1959, eventually achieving a rank of rear admiral. During World War II he was a submarine commander throughout, one of only two naval officers to hold that position, and live to tell of it, throughout the war. After the Japanese surrender, Bass led 12 submarines, dubbed “Benny’s Peacemakers,” into Tokyo Bay. After his naval retirement, Benny Bass worked for the Bendix Corporation as a consultant and later became a real estate broker. He was named “Benny” by his Naval Academy classmates because of a supposed resemblance to the professional boxer, Benny Leonard.",

At the Olympics, the world record holder Terje Pedersen did not make the final and other favorites performed well below their form, allowing Nevala to take the gold medal with a throw of 82.66 in the fourth round. After the Olympics, Nevala fell back to relative obscurity, finishing fourth at the 1966 Europeans and his attempt to defend his Olympic title at the 1968 Olympics was cut short in qualifying. In 1969 his career had a major resurgence, as he finally broke his six-year-old personal best multiple times and won a silver medal at the 1969 European Championships. In 1970, he was arguably the best javelin thrower in the world winning 50 out of his 55 competitions. In 1970 Nevala also threw his personal best of 92.64, only 6 cm short of Jorma Kinnunen’s world record. In addition to the world’s best performance of the year, Nevala was world ranked #1 by Track & Field News. He later openly attributed this resurgence to anabolic steroids, which were not banned at the time. Nevala’s career came to an abrupt end in April 1971, when, in his very first competition of the year, he injured his shoulder so badly he could never again throw seriously.

He lost the title after a controversial decision against Edward Mann in 1903 and, in the 1904 Championship, was knocked out for the first time in his competitive career, in the final, by A. H.

By then, he had been captain and honorary secretary of the Polytechnic team, and was serving as an ABA judge. He later became a life president of the Association. After his fifth ABA title, he quit competitive boxing, but came out of retirement to compete in the Olympic Games on “home soil” in 1908.

Although his son survived the ordeal of spending more than an hour in the icy Atlantic, Mr. Williams, Sr. perished. Dick Williams won the mixed doubles at the U.S. championships and the national clay court singles in his first American season (1912) and was ranked second nationally that year. In 1913, while still at Harvard, he began his Davis Cup career and in his eight single matches that year he lost only to James Parke, the Irish rugby football international, in the match against Great Britain. Williams was to remain a Davis Cup player until 1926 and in the intervening years he won the U.S. singles title twice and the men’s doubles on two occasions. Williams graduated from Harvard in 1916 and was soon with the armed forces. He saw active service as a captain of artillery and served as an aide to Major Gen. John Harbord, winning the Croix de Guerre and the Legion d’Honneur in the second battle of the Marne. After the war, Williams played his tennis at the Longwood Cricket Club and started his career as a stockbroker. In 1920 he teamed up with Charles Garland and they became the only Harvard-Yale combination to ever win the Wimbledon doubles. At the 1924 Olympics, Dick Williams went out to Henri Cochet in the quarter-finals of the singles; in the men’s doubles, playing with his former Harvard teammate, Watson Washburn, he again lost in the quarter-finals when the South Africans, Condon and Richardson, came back to win after trailing by two sets to one.

The survivors in Collapsible A were then transferred to Lifeboat 14, but even after entering Lifeboat 14 Williams spent several hours waist-deep in freezing water, which left his legs frostbitten and so severely injured that the Carpathia's doctor recommended amputation.

Between 1928-32, Murdoch went to University College, London, and obtained a B.Sc in engineering, and later became a mechanical engineer. It was during a visit to Germany in 1936, to be present at tests for an engine being developed for a motor yacht that Hawker chairman Sir Thomas Sopwith had ordered, that Murdoch was alarmed at the technical might the Germans would have if they invaded Europe. Murdoch reported this to Sopwith, who immediately decided to produce 1,000 Hurricane fighter planes in readiness for any battle for the skies over Britain. Sopwith and Murdoch had first met when sailing against each other in the 1930 Ramsgate to Ostend race. Two years later he joined Sopwith at the Hawker company. Murdoch was a skilled yachtsman and played a major part in Sopwith’s attempts to wrest the America’s Cup from the NY Yacht Club in his boat Endeavour in 1934 and 1937. After the War Murdoch worked in Belgium for the family firm of shipbuilders Guthrie, Murdoch and Company, founded by his grandfather. Murdoch was managing director until 1961.

920893,Dagoberto Ortensi,Male,12 March 1902,,, Italy,ITA,"Italian architect Dagoberto Ortensi was one of the three architects who created the Velodromo Olimpico for the 1960 Summer Olympics in Roma. The others were Cesare Ligini and Silvano Ricci. Ortensi received an Honorable Mention for his work Model for “Sports Centre and Olympic Village for the Games in 1956” at the 1948 London Olympics in the Art Competitions in the category Architecture, Architectural Designs. Ortensi graduated in 1925 in Engineering at the Politecnico di Torino. During the 1930s he was one of the most prolific protagonists of architecture and participated in the most important national competitions (including the competition for the building of the Littorio in Roma, for the design of the Via Roma in Torino, and for the European palace of Italian civilization). In 1932 he designed the Stadium Mussolini in Torino (which he entered for the 1936 Olympics together with Enrico Bianchini and Raffaello Fagnoni) and was invited by the City of Milano to carry out several projects for the construction of “minimal houses.” In May 1942, he obtained a professorship at the University in Roma for technical architecture, while during World War II he designed sports facilities throughout Italy. His main work was the cycling stadium built for the 1960 Olympics. The following year he was appointed professor of drawing at the Faculty of Engineering of the University of L’Aquila. According to the original plan, the “Stadio Benito Mussolini”, inaugurated in 1933, had a capacity of 65,000 seats and was the largest in Italy at the time. It was shaped as a large ellipsoidal ring whose circumference was about 640 m. For the 2006 Winter Olympics the stadium was renovated and extended, now called “Stadio Olimpico Torino”. The reason why the “Model for the Sports Center and Olympic Village for the Games 1956” was not designed is unknown. It may date back to the time of World War II when Roma was planning to compete for the 1944 Games. An application from Roma for the 1956 Summer Olympics, however, had never been considered. An image of the model of the stadium is depicted in the catalog of the 1948 art exhibition. There, it bears the description: “Model of an Olympic Stadium for 100,000 spectators with track and football field”. The “Sports Center Capannelle” are the sports facilities built by Ortensi in 1939-41 for the national firefighting training center in Roma-Capannelle. The other buildings were designed by Carlo Di Maria and Claudio Longo (1912–1997). Probably the swimming pool and the gym were shown in the photographic reproduction. The character of this complex is spacious and decorative and is adorned by several large marble statues around the pool. The frescoes in the gym come from Roberto Marcello “Iras“ Baldessari (1894-1965), the statues round the swimming pool from various Italian sculptors.",

Despite his age he made the team, was voted captain, was named to the Under-18 squad of the Canada national team, and won the provincial Junior Player of the Year Award, all within the span of a year. After the 1992 Junior World Championships he entered the University of Maine and began suiting up with their hockey team, the Black Bears, although he remained affiliated with Team Canada. During his two year stay he won the Hobey Baker Award in 1993 as the top collegiate men’s ice hockey player after helping his school bring home a national championship. He also won a series of national medals with team, including a gold medal at the 1993 Junior World Championships and a silver one at the 1994 Winter Olympics. At the latter tournament he scored three goals in eight games. Kariya had been recruited by the National Hockey League’s Mighty Ducks of Anaheim in 1993, but did not want to play with them until he had attended at least one edition of the Winter Olympics with his country. Thus, upon his return in 1994, he began an on-ice affiliation with the team that would last for nine seasons, until 2003. Along the way he was named team captain for the 1996-1997 season, took home a silver medal from the 1996 World Championships, and planned to attend the 1998 Winter Olympics, although his fourth on-ice concussion left him unable to skate for the majority of the 1997-1998 season. He got another chance in 2002, however, and took home Canada’s first Olympic gold medal in 50 years at that year’s ice hockey tournament, where he scored three goals in six games. He joined the NHL’s Colorado Avalanche in 2003, but became affiliated with the Nashville Predators for two years after the 2004-2005 league lockout.

Váradi won the Budapest International in 1922, 1924, and 1925 and Hungarian singles championships in 1922 and 1926. In 1924, she took part in the Paris Olympics, where she competed in singles and mixed doubles with Kelemen. In 1928 she finished her tennis career due to a series of injuries.

His first success came in 1929 in tennis, when he was the British Columbia provincial under-15 doubles champion. In rugby he faced the dominating New Zealand All Blacks as they toured Canada in 1936 and became the first Canadian to score against them. In cycling he was successful in the six-day races alongside his brother Torchy, won the provincial one mile title in 1934, and later turned professional, winning the national sprint title in 1939. He took up baseball in 1940 and quickly became a professional in that sport as well, being selected by the Pittsburgh Pirates in 1941 and playing in the minor leagues throughout the 1940s. He even managed the Rehoboth Beach Pirates of the Eastern Shore League for two seasons in 1947 and 1948. It was in basketball, however, that he found his greatest success. A member of the national championship-winning Victoria Blue Ribbons in 1935, he attempted to defend the crown the following year, when the team was renamed the Victoria Dominoes. Although he failed, his prowess was such that he was one of three members of his team (the others being brothers Chuck and Art Chapman) that were selected to join the victorious Windsor V-8s to compete in the inaugural Olympic basketball tournament at the 1936 Summer Games. There he played in five games, missing only Canada’s opening round victory against Brazil, scored 42 points, and took home a silver medal after his country lost the final 19-8 against the United States. He remained a member of the Dominoes for many years, winning a second national championship with them in 1946. Peden had a brief stint in professional basketball with the Vancouver Hornets of the Pacific Coast Professional Basketball League, from the league’s opening season in 1946 to its collapse in 1948. His athletic career came to an end in the 1950s, but he came second in the voting for Canada’s athlete of the half-century, losing narrowly to Lionel Conacher. After his retirement from active competition, he settled into a 26 year-career as a sports writer with the Victoria Times Colonist. He also served for three years, from 1942 through 1945, as a Lieutenant with the Canadian Army during World War II. Among others, he has been inducted into the British Columbia (1967), Canada’s (1979), and Greater Victoria (1991) Sports Halls of Fame.",Brother of Torchy Peden Cousin of Rusty Peden

After winning 100 m and 4x100 m relay golds at the 1964 European Junior Championships, she ran her first world record just a month before the 1964 Olympics, when she was part of the Skra Warszawa 4x100 m relay team that clocked 44.2 at the Polish championships. At the Olympics, Kłobukowska won bronze in the 100 and then helped the Polish team to win gold in the 4x100 relay with a world record of 43.6. In 1965, Kłobukowska won 100, 200 and 4x100 golds at the European Cup and that same year set her third world record by clocking 11.1 in 100 m in July in Praha. She competed at the 1966 European Championships, winning 100 and 4x100 relay golds, and a silver in the 200. She never won an individual Polish title, her only titles coming in 4x100 m relay in 1964 and 1966. In 1967, before the European Cup, held in Kyiv, Kłobukowska failed a gender verification test and was subsequently banned from competing in professional sports. The IAAF annulled her three World records, but allowed her to keep her Olympic and European Championships medals. Medical publications revealed that Kłobukowska had a genetic mosaicism, an abnormality where one’s cells have a different genetic makeup, which has varying effects on development. The test procedures were later found not to be accurate and her case led to a change in the gender verification policies by the IOC. After her forced retirement from sports, Kłobukowska graduated from the Warsaw School of Economics in 1972 with a master of economics degree and later worked for many years with Energomontaż-Północ Gdynia, the leading Polish supplier of multidisciplinary projects for offshore and onshore oil and the gas industry.

He was a self-taught artist except for brief periods at the Art Institute of Chicago and Académie Julian in Paris. His strong desire to travel around the world, led him to Mexico, Central America, North Africa, the Caribbean, and the South Pacific, especially Tahiti, less than two months after Paul Gauguin died. As early as 18, he sailed on to a cattle boat to London, and while there began his practice as an itinerant sign painter and stage painter to earn his living while traveling. Later Hart settled in Los Angeles and had contacts with the Ashcan School. His older siblings were also all artists. His manner of using watercolor was revolutionary for its time in its loose and free application. His painting used a wide range of subjects including animals, botanical studies, nudes, and landscapes. In the 1920s he also began printmaking, working in drypoint, lithographs, and etching. Hart added social-realistic and stylized elements to his impressionistic style. The Cockfight bears the subtitle Santo Domingo, which was probably referring to the capital of the Dominican Republic. The work was a hand-colored lithograph from 1923 measuring 19.7 x 32.4 cm (sheet 24.1 x 36.8 cm). Without coloring, there are also side-inverted prints of the same motif signed by the artist. Croquet Players, on the other hand, was a drawing in colored chalk, charcoal, and ink on paper. It was produced in 1929 sized 13.6 x 21 cm.",

67799,Jalmari Sauli,Male,17 August 1889,,, Finland,FIN,"Prior to his career as a successful writer and journalist Jalmari Sauli represented Finland in multiple track and field events at the Olympics. Sauli competed in four throwing events at the 1908 London Olympics, achieving top-10 places in three of them. He finished in seventh place in the shot put, with a throw of 12.58 metres, and seventh in the javelin, where his distance was not recorded. In the freestyle javelin throw he finished in eighth place with 43.30 metres, and finally he competed in the discus, where again the distance of his throw was not recorded. Sauli was also scheduled to compete in the Greek-style discus throw at the London Games but he did not start the event. Shortly after the London Olympics Sauli set a world and national record in two different shot put disciplines. In September 1908 he became the first Finn to throw further than 14 metres in the shot when he recorded 14.06 metres. Just over a week later, Sauli threw 25.38 metres in the two-handed shot put, with the throw adjudged to be a world record. From 1911 to 1914 Sauli worked as the assistant editor-in-chief of the Finnish daily newspaper Aamulehti. He moved up to editor-in-chief of the broadsheet newspaper Hämeen Sanomat from 1914 to 1917, and later worked on the weekly newspaper Järviseutu from 1937 to 1944. After his spell with the broadsheet paper, Sauli joined the White Guard but ended up getting wounded during the Finnish Civil War in 1918. It took several months for him to recover from his injuries, during which he found time to start writing novels. The first book Sauli wrote drew inspiration from his time in the war, and was credited as the first Finnish adventure novel. Sauli continued to write novels that were mainly aimed at young adults, but his output also included historical works and adventures set in the wilderness. As well as writing more than 40 novels, he also penned plays and wrote children’s books. Sauli won the Finnish State Prize for Literature in 1928 and again in 1937.

He was then eighth at the 1973 World Championships, before coming in as runner-up again in 1974. Although he missed the Olympics in 1976, he was eighth at the World Championships that year, and then switched to the 6 Metre class, in which he won the World Championships in 1977.

50888,Vladimir Salnikov,Male,21 May 1960,181.0,74, Soviet Union,URS,"In the late 1970s and early 1980s, Vladimir Salnikov was considered the greatest long-distance swimmer of his era, and some consider him the greatest ever. During his career Salnikov competed at three Olympic Games, three World Championships and three European Championships. Salnikov made his international début at the 1976 Olympics, when he was 16-years-old, placing fifth in the 1,500. At the 1980 Olympics Salnikov won gold medals in the 400 and 1,500 freestyles (with the first ever sub-15 minute time) and the 4x200 free relay. He remained the world’s greatest long distance swimmer, but the Soviet boycott of the 1984 Games denied him the opportunity of further Olympic honors that year. He returned from near retirement, however, to win a stunning victory in the 1,500 freestyle at the 1988 Seoul Olympics, when nobody considered him a favorite for any medal. At the World Championships Salnikov won the 400 and 1,500 in both 1978 and 1982. He also added two silver medals in the 4x200 freestyle relay at those championships. Salnikov competed at the World Championships for a third time in 1986 but, already 26-years-old, his best years were behind him and he had to settle for fourth place in the 1,500 and fifth in the 400. At the European Championships Salnikov won the 400 in 1983, the 1,500 in 1977, 1981 and 1983 and the 4x100 and 4x200 freestyle relay in 1981. Between 1979 and 1986 Salnikov set 13 world records, six at 400 metres (3:51.41/1979, 3:51.40/1979, 3:51.20/1980, 3:49.57/1982, 3:49.57/1982 and 3:48.32/1983), four at 800 metres (7:56.49/1979, 7:52.83/1982, 7:52.23/1983 and 7:50.64/1986), and three at 1,500 metres (14:58.27/1980, 14:56.35/1982 and 14:54.76/1983). Salnikov also won 20 Soviet titles: nine in the 400 (1979, 1981-88), 10 in the 1,500 (1978, 1979, 1981-88) and one in the 4x200 freestyle relay (1979). Salnikov retired from competitive swimming after the 1988 Olympics. From 1989-90 he was the head coach of the Soviet national swimming team and, from 1989-91, he was vice-president of the Soviet Swimming Federation. From 1991-2001 Salnikov was deputy to the general director of company Olimp and worked as a Speedo representative in Russia. Salnikov was a member of the Soviet Olympic Committee from 1984-90 and a member of the International Swimming Federation’s (FINA) Athletes’ Commission from 1991-2000. In 2009 Salnikov was elected president of the Russian Swimming Federation.

He took up the sport in 1930 and eventually settled on the featherweight class, setting three world records in that discipline – two in the press and one in overall – between 1938 and 1940. During this time he was forced to compete under the Juitsu Nan for Japan due to the Japanese occupation for Korea. His greatest success in international tournaments came at the 1947 World Championships, where he won a silver medal behind Robert Higgins of the United States. Higgins was absent from the 1948 Summer Olympics, making Nam a strong contender for the Olympic title, but he ended up placing fourth at the Games.

The following season he suited up with the Kitchener-Waterloo Dutchmen, but his Mennonite upbringing conflicted with the necessity to play games on Sunday and he quit the team in 1950, in addition to cancelling a contract with the National Hockey League’s New York Rangers. Half a decade later he resumed his career with the Elmira Polar Kings, but was called back to the Dutchmen in 1956 and was sent with them to represent Canada at that year’s Winter Olympic ice hockey tournament. He scored two goals in eight games at the event and took home a bronze medal. He remained with the team through 1959 and attended a second Olympic ice hockey tournament in 1960, when the Dutchmen were once again selected as delegates from Canada. At this event he played in seven matches, scored six goals, and brought back a silver medal for his country. He followed this up with a successful career in the Eastern Hockey League with the Johnstown Jets from 1961 through 1964 and also played two games with the Pittsburgh Hornets of the American Hockey League during this time. He had a brief international career as well, touring Russia and Sweden with the Chatham Maroons in 1961 and making a brief appearance with the Windsor Bulldogs of the International Hockey League during the 1963-1964 season. Martin had a coaching career for several years as well, as a player/coach with the Jets for the 1962-1963 season, a head coach with the Kitchener Rangers in 1964-1965 and, finally, as a player/coach with the Guelph Mercurys in 1967-1968, after a three-year playing hiatus. After retiring from hockey he found work as a luxury automobile salesman, a job that he has continued into his 80s.

Voglio during World War I.

He won 139 international caps and scored 650 goals. In 1966, Lübking won the field World Championships. He was considered one of the world’s best handball players of that era. Domestically, Lübking played with Dankersen from 1960-70, and with TuS Nettelstedt from 1970-78. With Dankersen he won West German field handball national titles in 1967 and 1970 and the European Champions Cup in field handball three years in succession, 1968-70. Between 1959 and 1970 he scored 4,011 goals for Dankersen. In 1970, Lübking moved to TuS Nettelstedt, for sporting and economic reasons, so he could work with the fashion company Hucke. Lübking’s move aroused significant furor among handball fans and the media. He was ostracized in Dankersen, received death threats, and his home’s windows were broken. His move to Dankersen was not popular in the handball world, and Werner Vick, German national coach, suspended him, although he was re-instated prior to the 1972 München Olympics. Tragically, Lübking’s 3-year-old son was also abducted, fortunately for only one day. During his time with Nettelstedt, Lübking added a further 2,222 goals to his already impressive tally. Lübking started a coaching career with Nettelstedt, before moves to TBV Lemgo, TuS Lahde, TuS Möllbergen back to Grün-Weiß Dankersen. By profession, he was a wholesaler working with Melitta, until his move to Nettelstedt. In 1966, he was awarded the Silver Bay Leaf, Germany`s highest sports award.",

In June 1929 he was practicing at The Ohio State rifle range when he was arrested and accused of the murder of Theora K. Hix, a medical student at Ohio State. It turned out that Snook and Hix had posed as man and wife for three years, sharing an apartment near the school’s campus. On 13 June 1929, Snook claimed that Hix asked him to divorce his wife and marry her, threatening to kill his wife and child if she was refused. Snook confessed to then beating Hix several times with a hammer before severing her jugular vein with a pocket-knife to “relieve her suffering.” On 14 August 1929 a jury deliberated only 28 minutes before finding Snook guilty of first degree murder. A week later he was sentenced to be put to death, and at 7:10 p.m. on 28 February 1930, he died in the electric chair at The Ohio State Penitentiary.",Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the World Shooting Championships (1–0–0 1913 Camp Perry gold: 50 m free pistol team) Listed in Olympians Who Were Sent to Prison (Found guilty of murder and later suffered the death penalty.)

The next year, Lemeshev won the light-middleweight European junior title and repeated that victory in 1972, this time as a middleweight. In both of those tournaments, Lemeshev was selected as the best boxer of the tournament and was twice awarded the Émile Grémaux Trophy. In 1971, Lemeshev won gold at the World Army Championships and in 1972 was selected for the Soviet Olympic team. At the Olympics, Lemeshev was unstoppable, defeating four of his five opponents (including the finalist Reima Virtanen of Finland) by knockouts. In 1973, Lemeshev won the European middleweight title, which he repeated in 1975. In 1974, Lemeshev won his only Soviet title, this time in light-heavyweight and his other Soviet Championship medals, a silver in 1975 and bronze in 1976, came in middleweight. Lemeshev retired from boxing with a record of 103 wins out of 111 bouts after he was not selected for the 1976 Soviet Olympic team. During his early career, Lemeshev had shown a fondness for alcohol and his worsening alcoholism seriously hampered his later years as a boxer. During his boxing career, Lemeshev served in the Soviet Army and after his retirement from boxing was offered a job as a boxing coach with the Soviet Army. But his impatient and drunken behavior initiated a lot of fights between him and young soldiers, often resulting in him being knocked out by the much fitter, younger soldiers. This angered him even more and resulted in new fights until he was dishonorably discharged from the Army. After discharge, Lemeshev continued fighting in bars and was unable to keep any job. He worked as a machinist in a factory, as a janitor, as a gardener and as a gravedigger, never keeping the job long. Due to his lifestyle, Lemeshev’s health started to deteriorate and by the 1990s he was unable to walk. In 1995 he underwent a craniotomy, but his health continued to decline and he died in early 1996, at only 43 years old. Since 1997 a memorial tournament is held annually in his honor in Moscow.",

Moser was supposed to be the next Italian campionissimo and, although, he won a lot of races, he seemed to disappoint the Italian cycling cognoscenti because he never won as much as Fausto Coppi. But Moser used his great track pursuiting ability to allow him to win many races with his sprint. In addition, his ability to mount a long, sustained attack was almost legendary. Moser used this to break Eddy Merckx’s world hour record in 1984, although that was later changed to a different category because of newer bike technology. Moser’s two greatest victories were the 1984 Giro d’Italia and the 1977 World Championship road race. His World Championship was sandwiched by two second places in the race, in 1976 behind Freddy Maertens and in 1978 behind Gerrie Knetemann. He also won the 1976 individual pursuit World Championship on the track.

But the timing was sensitive enough to measure to thousandths of a second and Larsson’s 4:31.981 defeated McKee’s 4:31.983 – a margin of 2/1,000ths of a second. This episode caused a change in international rules, as McKee’s defeat was by less than the amount a fingernail grows over several weeks. In fact, it was determined that McKee could actually have lost had the paint on the wall in his lane been applied slightly too thin.

The 2008 season was narrowly focused on the Olympic Games and after Pooley rode selflessly for Nicole Cooke in the road race, she rode a superb time trial on a course suited to her climbing talents and won the silver medal. The following year she won her first Grande Tour when she won a severely truncated Grande Boucle and was national time trial champion for the first time. If 2009 was a successful year then 2010 should be considered her tour de force. Not only did Emma retain her national time trial title but she also broke Nicole Cooke’s nine-year monopoly on the British road race championship and, at the end of the year, was crowned World Time Trial champion as well. She could not retain her world title in 2011 but did bring home a bronze in her specialist event and placed second in the Giro d’Italia Feminine. Pooley failed to win a medal at the 2012 Olympics but won two silvers, in the time trial and road race at the 2014 Commonwealth Games.

57825,Kristjan Palusalu,Male,10 March 1908,185.0,110, Estonia,EST,"Kristjan Palusalu can claim, more than any other wrestler, that for one year he was the ultimate wrestling champion. Palusalu shares with Ivar Johansson and Källe Anttila the distinction of having won Olympic gold in both styles of wrestling. Only he and Johansson, however, won them in the same Olympic year – 1936 for Palusalu. Palusalu wrestled in the heavyweight class, however, and was thus undoubtedly the finest wrestler in the world for the year 1936. Palusalu participated in gymnastics, weightlifting and track and field athletics as a youth, not taking up wrestling until 1929, when he was already 21-years-old and serving in the Estonian Navy. Palusalu won his first medal in 1930, a bronze in freestyle heavyweight, at the Estonian Championships. In 1931 Palusalu won his first Estonian freestyle heavyweight title and, in 1932, won his first Estonian Greco-Roman title. Estonia did not send an Olympic team to the 1932 Olympics due to the Great Depression, so Palusalu made his international début at the 1933 European Greco-Roman Championships, where he was fourth in heavyweight. The next international tournament where Palusalu competed was his best, the 1936 Olympics, where he won gold medals in both styles. After the Olympics Palusalu won the 1937 European Greco-Roman heavyweight title, but had to retire from sports in early 1938 due to a severe shoulder injury. Domestically, Palusalu won 12 Estonian titles, from 1932-38 in Greco-Roman heavyweight and in 1931-33, and 1935-36 in freestyle heavyweight, and was selected as Estonian Sportsman of the Year in 1936. From 1933-40 Palusalu worked as a prison guard in the Tallinn Central Prison. In 1940, when the Soviet Union annexed Estonia, Palusalu was sent to a Kotlas labor camp in Arkhangelsk Oblast. Palusalu managed to escape in 1941 with some friends, but he was caught and sentenced to death. This was commuted only to have him sent to the front on the Karelian Isthmus against the Finns. Half an hour after arriving on the front, Palusalu tried to cross and luckily was recognized by Heikki Savolainen, a lieutenant colonel of the Finnish Army, who ordered a ceasefire so that Palusalu could cross the front. Palusalu returned to the now German-occupied Estonia, but was arrested again by the Soviets in 1944 when they re-occupied Estonia. Palusalu was sent to a Siberian prison camp, but was released after two years. After his release Palusalu returned to Estonia, but was initially not allowed to work as a wrestling coach or act as a wrestling referee by Soviet officials. Thus, until his retirement in the late 1970s, Palusalu worked as a construction worker, although during the 1960s, during the Khrushchev Thaw, he was allowed to act as a wrestling referee in some local tournaments.","Listed in Olympic Wrestling Champions in Both Freestyle and Greco-Roman (1936 Freestyle Heavyweight; 1936 Greco-Roman Heavyweight.)

In 1934 he came second in the Holmenkollen 17 km, and in 1935 was national champion at 17 km. Later in the season he placed sixth in the 18 km race at the World Championships in Vysoke Tatry, and earned a silver medal as a member of Norway’s 4×10 km relay team. In the 1936 Winter Olympic cross-country relay, Iversen skied the anchor leg for Norway, and had a lead of 1:22 at the last exchange over Finland’s last skier Kalle Jalkanen. Iversen was a good technician on the easier part of the course, but his weak point was obviously uphill. The first half of the course was mostly uphill, and Jalkanen decided to give all he had from the start. His tactics succeeded, catching the nervous Iversen halfway. They stayed together for another 2-3 km, and then Jalkanen made his final move and was able to leave Iversen 30 m behind. The winning margin for Finland was six seconds. Iversen continued his skiing career until the outbreak of World War II, his best placing after 1936 was fifth at 17 km in the Norwegian Championships 1939. He was the only member of the 1936 Norwegian cross-country team who came from the Oslo area.",Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the World Nordic Ski Championships (0–2–0 1935 Vysoké Tatry CCS silver: 4×10 km relay; 1936 Garmisch-Partenkirchen (Olympics) CCS silver: 4×10 km relay)
