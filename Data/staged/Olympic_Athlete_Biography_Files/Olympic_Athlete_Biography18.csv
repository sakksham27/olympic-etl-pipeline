At the request of his former artillery regiment, in 1956, during the Hungarian anti-Communist uprising, he became commander of the National Guard in the city of Nagykanizsa. After the defeat of the revolution, he was sentenced to 15 years in prison, but was given amnesty and was released after six years. After his release, Orbán operated a riding school in Siófok, and coached modern pentathletes in shooting in Budapest. He retired in 1972 but worked for a while as a janitor at the Ethnographic Museum.

Giovanardi also held some important posts, including vice-president and secretary of the Medical Association, president of the Red Cross of Modena, and founder of the Confraternita della Misericordia. In 2016, after his resignation as director at Modena, Giovanardi decided to speak about his long experience as a doctor engaged in the medical emergency field. His true stories of doctors and healthcare professionals, and their daily work “in the trenches”, was a hard, bitter, painful and also ironic and funny account. He also recalled the long-standing disputes and lack of communications with administrators and politicians. These stories are all told in his book Il Pronto Soccorso é malato (The First Aid is Sick).

After placing second in the 1996 World Championships the pair repeated the feat at the Atlanta Olympics and were only denied a chance of the gold medal by a disqualification in race four. Sadly their partnership was to end in tragedy. In October 1997 the two men were being driven back to their hotel after racing in the European Championships when the driver lost control and veered off the road. Merricks was killed instantly in the accident. After some time away from the water Walker reappeared with new partner Mark Covell. Covell had also suffered personal tragedy when his sailing partner, 1996 Olympian Glyn Charles, had been lost at sea during the 1998 Sydney-to-Hobart race. Together Walker and Covell were the British entry in the Star class at the Sydney Olympics. They came within a point of an emotive victory but lost out to the American pair in the battle for the Olympic title. Since then Walker has been involved in the crew in prospective America’s Cup challengers from Great Britain (2002-3 as skipper) and Italy (2007 as tactician).

Initially a long-distance and cross-country runner, he soon realised he could only last the pace over short distances. Jones subsequently went on to join the band of successful British sprinters in the early 1960s. Jones won three consecutive AAA 220 yards titles 1959-61, was runner-up in 1962, and won his fourth title in 1963. He was only the second man after McDonald Bailey to win four 220 titles. Jones was runner-up to Peter Radford in the AAA 100 yards in 1960 and was third behind the Canadian winner Harry Jerome the following year. Jones went to the 1960 Roma Olympics and competed in both individual sprint events and won a bronze medal with Radford, David Segal and Nick Whitehead in the 4 x 100 metres relay. Jones was edged out of a place in the 100 metres final when beaten in a photo-finish by the American Ray Norton in the semi-final. Jones enjoyed success internationally in 1962 when he won gold in the 4x110 yards relay at the Perth British Empire and Commonwealth Games. He also won bronze in the 220 yards, and at that year’s European Championships at Beograd (Belgrade) he won another bronze with the sprint relay. In the Great Britain v USA match at the White City in 1963, Jones was part of the sprint relay team with Radford, Ron Jones and Berwyn Jones who defeated the invincible USA squad, which included Bob Hayes. Jones was also a very good hockey player and could well have made the British Olympic squad had it not been for his love of sprinting. He was a fine winger and had a spell with leading club Southgate. He was also the secretary and president of the touring Ghost Hockey Club. Jones, who worked for a local brewery after leaving school, went on to become the assistant secretary of the International Athletes’ Club. He was also part of the ITV track and field commentary team for the 1964 Tokyo Olympics.

He also won the Italian Cup in 1967, the European Cup twice (1963 and 1969), and the European Cup-Winners’ Cup in 1968. Trappattoni finished his career at the end of the 1971/72 season, after 10 games with Varese. As a manager/coach, Trapattoni joined a select band of five managers to win League titles in four different countries. He won 10 titles in Italy with Juventus, A. C. Milan and Internazionale, and then enjoyed similar success with Bayern München (Germany), Benfica (Portugal) and Red Bull Salzburg (Austria). Alongside Udo Lattek, Trapattoni is the only other coach to have won all three major European club competitions, the European Cup, UEFA Cup and Cup-Winners’ Cup. Uniquely, he was the only one to do so with the same club, Juventus. In addition, Trapattoni won the European Super Cup and Intercontinental Cup with Juventus, in 1984 and 1985 respectively. He is one of a small group to have won European Cup, Cup-Winners’ Cup and Intercontinental Cup as both player and manager. Trapattoni’s personal honours include European Coach of the Year (1985 and 1991), European Coach of the Season (1985 and 1993) and membership into the Italian Football Hall of Fame (2012). As a player, Trapattoni won 17 full international caps and was a member of the 1960 Italian Olympic, and 1962 World Cup squads, although he did not play in the latter. He went on to coach the Italian national side, but could not replicate his success as a player, and suffered early exits from both the 2002 World Cup, and Euro 2004. Between 2008-13 he was manager of the Republic of Ireland, and led them to two European Championships, in 2012 (their first for 24 years), and 2016. He narrowly missed taking Ireland to the 2010 World Cup finals, when they lost a qualifying play-off match to France after Thierry Henry twice illegally handled the ball, before it found its way to Willam Gallas, who scored France’s extra-time winner.",

He won the gold medal in the clay pigeon, double shot, with 15 hits out of a possible 20 and he also won the bronze medal in the single shot event. The considerable fortune of the Merlin family and their native-born knowledge of the Greek language placed them among the leaders of Greek Society at the turn of the century. The family were substantial landowners and one of the main thoroughfares of Athens is still known as Merlin Street. Sidney Merlin married Zaira, the daughter of George Theotokis, the Greek Prime Minister, and when they were later divorced Zaira married Ioannis Rollis who, like his father-in-law, also became Prime Minister. Sidney Merlin and Gerald Merlin are invariably referred to as brothers but this is not correct. A search of the British Consular Birth Register reveals that Gerald was the son of Charles E. P. Merlin and his wife Irene (nee Stournare) whereas Sidney was the son of the British Vice-Consul for Athens, Charles L. W. Merlin and his wife Isabella (née Green).

45217,Cecil Healy,Male,28 November 1881,,, Australasia  Australia,ANZ,"A pioneer of the Australian crawl style of freestyle and of the technique of side-breathing, Healy emerged as a force in Australian swimming in 1905 when he won both state and Australasian championship at 110 yards freestyle, the latter in a time which equalled the world record. After retaining the Australasian championship in 1906 he was one of just five Australians chosen to travel to Athens. After taking bronze in Athens he went on to tour Europe, winning the championships of England and Germany. Australasian champion in the 110 yards freestyle from 1908 to 1910, a lack of funds caused him to miss the 1908 London Games. Healy’s performances in 1912 meant that he was chosen for the combined Australasian team for Stockholm and was centrally involved in one of the controversies of the Games. An error by the team management of the US team meant that the US contingent missed the semi-finals of the 100m freestyle. Healy argued on behalf of the Americans and assisted in their successful appeal to be able to swim an extra qualification race. The Australian finished second in the final behind American Duke Kahanamoku, the winner of the additional race. Healy set a world record in his heat of the 400m freestyle but finished fourth in the final as others smashed his world mark. He rounded off his Olympic career by providing the lead-off leg for the victorious Australasian squad in the 4 x 200m freestyle relay. After a European tour, in which he broke the world record for the 220 yards freestyle, Healy retired. An accomplished surfer and water polo player, Healy was a founder member of the Manly Surf Club and was awarded a medal from the Royal Humane Society for his role in saving many lives in the waters around Manly. In 1915 Healy volunteered for service with the Australian Defence Force and, after service in Egypt and France, was sent to England to officer training. Leading his men into battle for the first time, he was killed attempting to storm the machine-gun defended German stronghold at Mont St Quentin. He is the only Australian gold medallist to have been killed in action. Some sources claim he is the brother of Alfred Healey, but this is likely not correct. His will mentions a brother, Harold, but has no mention of Alfred.","Listed in Olympians Who Set a World Record in Long Course Swimming (4×200 m freestyle relay – 12 July 1912 - 29 August 1920: 10:14.0 (12 July 1912; Stockholm, SWE), 10:11.6 (15 July 1912; Stockholm, SWE)) Listed in Olympians Who Were Killed or Missing in Action or Died as a Result of War (†29 August 1918.

She won her 1912 singles gold medal by a bit of gamesmanship: when trailing she left the court to change her shoes, and after returning, her opponent Dora Köring was completely out of rhythm and lost the match. Broquedis was French ladies’ singles champion in 1913-14, won the ladies’ doubles in 1924, with Yvonne Bourgeois, and was mixed doubles champion in 1911, with André Gobert, and 1924, with Jean Borotra. All of those championships were won when the French title was a closed competition. In 1927 she won what is considered her only Grand Slam title when, by then as Mrs. Bordes, she and Borotra won the French mixed doubles after it had become an open competition. Broquedis also won the 1912 World Hard Court Title, which was, at that time, played on clay. Indoors she won multiple French titles – ladies’ singles in 1910, 1912-13, 1922, 1925, and 1927; ladies’ doubles in 1925, with Bourgeois; and mixed doubles in 1913 (with William Laurentz) and 1922 and 1925 with Borotra. Termed “The Goddess” for her pinup looks, Broquedis is actually best known as the last player to have defeated Suzanne Lenglen in a full match, which she did in May 1914 in the French Closed Final. Lenglen was only 15-years-old at the time and lost only one other known match, when she withdrew from illness in 1921 while playing Molla Bjurstedt-Mallory.",

Miles started playing Polo at the age of 20 in 1915 and he won the Argentine Open, when it was called the River Plate Championship, with North Santa Fe the following year and again in 1917. He won it again, with Las Rosas, in 1919 and 1923 by which time his handicap had risen from three to seven, his brother David played alongside him in all four championship winning teams. David was a 9-handicap player but was sadly killed in a plane crash in 1934. Juan had a natural talent for the sport and his handicap eventually rose to nine. In 1922 he was on the Argentine Federation side that won the Hurlingham Challenge Cup and Roehampton Open in England, and then the US Open. He played for Argentina in the inaugural Cup of the Americas in 1928 when he was also on the winning US Open side at Meadow Brook.

In retrospect, his win should have not been a surprise. The running hop, step, and jump (as the triple jump was then called) was not very popular in Australia back then, so the first national championships were only held in 1930, six years after his Olympic gold. Winter’s experience was thus limited to local club competitions before the 1924 Olympics. It was later discovered, however, that Winter was world ranked #1 in triple jump in 1921 with a result of 15.15 on November 1921 at the South Sydney AAC championships and #3 in 1922, jumping 14.73 in March 1922 at the New South Wales AAA championships. In 1920 Winter was considered for the Australian Olympic team, but was not chosen and in 1924 he was the last athlete selected for the squad. He also competed at the 1928 Olympics, but by then 34-years-old, managed only 12th place. Winter won his only Australian triple jump title in 1930, when it was contested for the first time and captured silver at the 1932 Australian championships. He was ranked in the world top 10 in triple jump every year from 1919-28. Winter was also an excellent high jumper and hurdler, played rugby league football, cricket, tennis, golf, wrestling, and later became a skilled billiards player. Outside of sports, Winter worked as a general laborer before enlisting in the Australian Imperial Force in July 1915. He was posted to the Australian Army Service Corps in Egypt as a driver in January 1916 and, arriving in France in June 1916, was employed mainly in depot duties. Winter returned to Australia in 1919 and from 1919-27 worked as a fireman under the Board of Fire Commissioners of New South Wales stationed in Manly. He left the fire service in December 1927, and in the 1930s and 1940s ran his own billiard parlor, while also conducting a hairdressing and tobacconist business. A heavy drinker for several years, Winter died from carbon monoxide poisoning at his Pagewood home on or about 6 May 1955, according to the coroner. Winter apparently stumbled in his bathroom, fell and hit his head, and broke open a gas pipe. Personal Best: TJ – 15.525 (1924).",

The family was one of the best known and most remarkable medical families in the US. Early in his career he studied with André Jean Castaigne (1861-1929), the French painter and popular illustrator. Theobald was mainly painting seascapes, dock scenes, landscapes, still lifes, animals and horse scenes, and portraits. Samuel Jr. lived mostly in Manhattan’s Greenwich Village. During the winter, he often visited the quarters of the Barnum & Bailey Circus in Florida and painted animals and performers. On Fire Island in New York, he found motifs for seascapes and harbor scenes. His 1932 entry was titled Brookmeade Stables - Brice. Brookmeade was a successful horse racing and breeding stable owned by Dodge automobile heiress Isabel Dodge Sloane (1896-1962). It existed 1924-62. Brookmeade horses won each of the three races of the American Triple Crown series. “Brice” was a horse that won the Bushwick Obstacle Race for this stable in 1928.

This sculpture was designed in 1931 and cast in bronze in 1934/1936 and is now placed at the entrance of the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark in Berlin. According to the description in the General Lexicon of Artists, the monumental bronze sculpture combines “elements of futurism with an exaggerated realism, combines powerful body shapes with dynamic structures”. It was exhibited in Firenze in 1933 and in Venezia in 1934 and was bought by the city of Berlin after the Olympics. As early as 1937, it was erected at the “Lonely Poplar” ground, where football was played for the first time in Berlin. When a new stadium was built on the site for the socialist World Youth Games in 1951, it was re-erected. Another version of the sculpture was located near Stadio Giovanni Berta in Firenze, opened in 1931, possibly the plaster model, but it was obviously also sent to Berlin. This is also indicated by the creation times given in the catalog. A recent plaster copy of the Football Player was placed at the entrance of the Technical Center of the Italian Football Association (Coverciano) in Firenze and shown on an Italian stamp on the occasion of its inauguration. It is not known which of Moschi’s medals were entered in 1936. He also exhibited a collection of medals in 1952, but it is unknown which medals were presented. Medals commemorating the construction of the Olympic Stadium in Roma in 1953 and the World Gymnastics Championships in Roma in 1954, for example, date from the beginning of the 1950s. From 1910-15 Moschi attended the Academy of Fine Arts in Firenze. After World War I, during which he stayed in Nice producing caricatures for a newspaper, he returned to Firenze in 1923 and opened a studio designing coins as well as war memorials and other sculptures for public space. He then specialized in engraving medals, but also produced numerous decorative fountains for villas and squares. Later he increasingly took on the feeling for art of Fascism and taught sculpture in Lucca from 1941. After the war, Moschi received few orders because of his proximity to Fascism, but he was able to re-establish itself first in the USA and then also in Italy.",

51430,Fred Kahele,Male,5 November 1900,,, United States,USA,"Though it is known that Fred Kahele was born in Kipahulu on the island of Maui, Hawai’i, information about his early life and family remains elusive and unclear. He was raised in Honolulu and enrolled in the United States Naval Reserve at a recruiting station in San Francisco in 1917; his service would see him stationed for stints in New York as well as California over the next few years. He was a member of the Central YMCA in Brooklyn, New York, and in 1920 he finished fourth in 400 free and third in the 1,500 free at the United Stares Olympic Trials which earned a spot on the American swimming delegation to the Antwerpen Olympics. There, he swam the 400 and 1,500 freestyles, finishing an unfortunate fourth in both events. Upon his return from the Olympics, Kahele returned to his residence in Brooklyn and continued to compete in events with the Central YMCA swimming club. In early 1921, he embarked on a tour of the midwestern United States where he competed in and won titles at various swimming meets under the banner of the Central YMCA. In an unfortunate event, his home was burglarized and all of his medals, trophies and swim equipment were stolen shortly after his return home, on February 3, 1921. His bad luck continued next month after he was confined to a naval hospital for the entire month with a bad case of influenza. He later moved to California by October and took up residence in Long Beach where he joined the Long Beach Bath House aquatic team. Kahele married Katherine Bellew at the municipal building in Chico, California in July 1922, and eventually moved there where he continued to swim and also found a side gig in a Hawai’ian entertainers’ group. He was a member of swimming clubs in Stockton and Pacific City over the next few years. A warrant for his arrest was issued in March 1923 on an allegation of desertion by his then-pregnant wife; he was later arrested in April and eventually released after a financial arrangement was struck. His only son, Fred Jr. was born in Oroville, California on June 8, 1923. Kahele found himself in custody on charges of desertion once again in October of that year, this time arrested in the midst of a swim meet at Sutro Baths. It would seem, however, that he eventually made amends with his family, as by 1924 the couple was residing in Oakland, with Fred now retired from competitive swimming. Here, he was a member of an entertainment group, the Mid-Pacific Quartet in which he played the guitar. Kahele changed the family surname to “Kalune” sometime between 1925 and 1928 and continued to reside in Oakland, working in various jobs including as a stevedore on the docks as well as a foreman at a fruit ranch. By the 1940s, the family relocated to Lodi, California. His son, by then known as Fred George Kalune, went on to serve overseas in World War II with the United States Army Air Corps. Fred Kulanui Kalune died in Stockton, California at the age of 74.",

Despite a long spell of hospitalisation in North Africa, he resumed duties with the RNVR before the War was over. After the hostilities, Scott read architecture at the North London Polytechnic and at the same time joined the Thames Rowing Club. Two years later, following a successful Henley Royal Regatta, he was drafted into the Olympic squad and selected for the coxed pairs with Howard James and cox David Walker. After the Olympics, Mark Scott told Alan Shrimpton, a former master at Bryanston School, that he and James rowed without a rudder at the Games, deliberately sawing it off so as not to let the young 16-year-old cox hinder them by not steering correctly. The rules said they had to row with a cox, but did not mention a rudder!

In 1942 when just 17, Nankeville won an invitation half-mile race at Dorking, in an event to raise money for the Red Cross during the World War II. It was only after being called up for National Service, where he became an Army PE teacher, that he took athletics seriously. Originally a sprinter, he won Army half- and one-mile titles during his time in service and, after selection for the 1948 London Olympics, was given a month’s leave from the Army to prepare for the Games. After the Olympics, Nankeville left the Army and before the decade was out, he was regarded as Britain’s best miler, and in 1948 won the first of three consecutive AAA titles, adding a fourth in 1952 when he beat John Landy. Nankeville also finished second, to Roger Bannister, in 1951 and was third on two other occasions, 1947 and 1953. Within a seven week period in August and September 1953, Nankeville was involved in two world record runs. Firstly, the 4 x 1-mile with Bannister, Chris Chataway and Don Seaman, and the 4 x 1500 metres with Gordon Pirie, David Law and Ralph Dunkley. In the first of those two races, Nankeville ran the fastest lap in 4:06.6. Nankeville left school at 14 and worked for the Vickers-Armstrong aircraft company before later working for the famous sports goods firm Lillywhites, until he opened his own warehouse and three discount stores. He was married to his wife Janet for 63 years until her death in 2010. They had three children, a girl and two boys. One of the boys went on to become a famous British actor and comedian under the name of Bobby Davro. Their other son David became a professional golfer, and was a one-time top class junior who led the first round of the 1972 British Youth Championship, following a 66 at Glasgow Gailes. He ended up finishing 11 strokes behind the winner Andrew “Chubby” Chandler, later known for his sports management company, International Sports Management (ISM). Nankeville wrote a book about Roger Bannister’s historic sub-four minute mile entitled “The Miracle of the Mile”, published by Stanley Paul in 1956.

He quickly displayed talent in track and field, particularly at the 1,500m distance, and earned a chance to try out for the Canada’s 1936 Summer Olympic delegation by winning the B.C. Mile Championship in June of that year. The city of Nanaimo banded together to collect the $350 that was required to send him to Montreal for the tryouts and Thompson did not disappoint, earning himself a chance to represent his country at the Games. In the 1,500 metre event, however, he finished eighth in his heat in the opening round and was eliminated. Upon his return he worked as an exercise instructor and trained to compete at the 1938 British Empire Games, but a broken leg prevented him from making the journey. At the outbreak of World War II he travelled to England and joined the Royal Air Force, dying at the age of only 28 in 1943 following an airplane accident. He was inducted into the Nanaimo Sports Hall of Fame in 2008 as a member of the inaugural class of pioneers.

In the final stage of World War II, Takata’s atelier in Tokyo burned down and he was evacuated to his hometown of Kurume. After the war, Takata continued to exhibit and paint replicas and also travelled frequently. One of his favorite landscape motives became the area around Mount Kujū in the Ōita prefecture. Takata illustrated, for instance, the novel Kyoto (Old Capital) by Nobel Prize winner Yasunari Kawabata with a series of very beautiful scenes from the Japanese country, especially from the island of Kyushu, and temples, gardens and palaces in the city of Kyoto.

921781,George Bellows,Male,12 August 1882,,, United States,USA,"George Bellows was an American painter, draftsman and lithographer who became best known for his images of urban life in New York, especially scenes from the streets and pub pictures. His style was that of an American Realist, especially of the so-called Ashcan School. He also worked as a graphic designer and illustrator for a number of magazines such as Harper’s Weekly, Collier’s, Vanity Fair, Metropolitan, and the socialist magazine, The Masses. In addition to boxing, he also painted scenes from tennis and baseball, as he himself was an avid sportsman. Later he painted portraits and family scenes that varied greatly in style. His father was an architect and master builder. George Bellows first worked as a sports reporter for a local newspaper, before studying in Columbus, his birthplace, and later in New York. He stayed there until the end of his life and taught at the Art Students League. In 1925 Bellows died from a ruptured appendix. Because his works were shown posthumously, they were entered hors concours in 1932. Stag at Sharkey’s was one of Bellows’ most famous paintings. He is said to have been a regular visitor to Sharkey’s Athletic Club himself. The club was founded by heavyweight boxer “Sailor Tom” Sharkey (1873-1953). At the time boxing matches were allowed only as part of private club events. Non-members were only temporarily admitted and referred to as “Stag”. The oil painting on canvas (92 x 122.6 cm) was created in 1909 and is part of the collection of the Cleveland Museum of Art. In 1917 Bellows produced an etching with the same motif.

After the Boer War (1899-1902), in which he and his sons were involved, they returned to Germany in 1903 and again were granted German civil rights.

87862,Erhard Keller,Male,24 December 1944,183.0,78, West Germany,FRG,"A real sprinter, Erhard Keller’s career started when dedicated sprint competitions were only just springing up, so the number of titles available to him was limited. Keller – who was called the “Flying Dentist” – nonetheless took full advantage of these opportunities, winning the Olympic 500 m twice in a row, in 1968 and 1972, becoming only the second repeat winner after Yevgeny Grishin. Between 1968 and 1972, Keller also bettered the 500 m world record four times, each time at his home rink in the Bavarian town of Inzell. One of these records was set in March 1972, in the same competition he also lowered the 1,000 m and sprint combination world record. The first World Sprint Championships (although that status was awarded retro-actively) were held in 1970, and Keller placed sixth. In 1971 he improved to first place, winning the second 500 m. Following the Sapporo Olympics, Keller turned professional with the ISSL, but was bested by Hasse Börjes in the championship races. He retired from international competition before the pro league folded, having completed his dentist studies. Keller would continue to race nationally, and he would win his fourth sprint title (after 1970-72) as late as 1977. Besides his dental practice, Keller also appeared on television as a presenter, and acted as a color commentator for the Olympic speed skating competitions on (West) German television for many years. In 2011 he was inducted into the German Sports Hall of Fame.

Initially a high hurdler, she switched to intermediate hurdles in 1987. Competing at three Olympic Games, four World Championships and three European Championships, Gunnell was the top female 400 m hurdler of the world in the early 1990s. Gunnell won the 400 m hurdles Olympic gold in 1992, a World title in 1993 and silver in 1991, and the 1994 European title. A decent long sprinter, she was also a regular member of British 4x400 m relay team that won bronze medals at the 1992 Olympics, the 1993 World Championships, and the 1990 Europeans. At the Commonwealth Games she won titles in the 1986 high hurdles, 1990 and 1994 intermediate hurdles, and the 1990 and 1994 4x400 relay, adding a high hurdles silver in 1990. Gunnell also won titles at the 1994 World Cup in both 400 m hurdles and 4x400 m relay, the European Cup 400 m hurdles in 1993-94, and 1996-97; the 1994 Goodwill Games 400 m hurdles, and the 1989 European Indoor open 400.

On leaving school in 1929, he joined the London Athletic Club and narrowly failed to win selection for the 1932 Olympics in Los Angeles. He reached the final of the AAA 220 yards that year and achieved the fastest 400 metre time of his career when he ran 48.6 in Paris. In 1933, Wolff won his only AAA 440 yards title and later in the season was the winner in the international match against France. His next major international test came in the 4x400 metre relay at the 1936 Olympics when he ran the first leg for the British team that won the gold medals with a new European record of 3:09.0. Although he handed over the baton in fourth place at the end of his leg, he had just managed to keep within striking distance of the strong American team and Godfrey Rampling, Bill Roberts, and Godfrey Brown eventually recorded a comfortable victory. After an international tour of Scandinavia in 1937, Wolff retired and devoted himself to the family business. He served in the war as a captain in the Oxford & Buck Light Infantry and then went on to head his grandfather’s firm of commodity brokers. In 1970 he served as chairman of the London Metal Exchange and in 1975 he was awarded the CBE for his services to invisible exports. On his retirement from business, the Financial Times described him as “the best-known metal trader in the world”, but Wolff always said that his Olympic gold medal was one piece of metal that he would never trade. The good-natured Freddie Wolff died on the day that a reception was held at Buckingham Palace for all surviving British Olympic medalists but the British Olympic Association had earlier delivered his commemorative award to his bedside at the London Clinic.

In 1912 he received the Rome Prize with a corresponding travel grant. During World War I he was an official war artist in Italy and in Orient, as he was during World War II in France, Russia and Greece. Between the wars he worked as a freelance artist and became a member of the Vienna Künstlerhaus in 1919. In 1930 he was appointed professor and attended the exhibitions in München’s (Munich) Deutschem Haus (German House). He painted in a naturalistic, often heroic style with martial elements. After 1945 Janesch produced murals for the “Iron Room” of the Museum of Military History located in Wien, which he finished in 1954. In spite of his dubious role during the Nazi period, he remained a well-known and highly decorated artist. He was awarded the Golden Laurel of the Vienna Künstlerhaus and, shortly before his death, the Austrian Cross of Honor for Science and Art. One of his works, Water Sports, was submitted for the 1936 Berlin Olympics. It was a representation of the perfect beauty of a race steeled in battle and sport, inspired not by antiquity or classicism but by the pulsing life of current events. Adolf Hitler took this painting for his private collection. The painting in oil on canvas was created in 1936 in the format 153 x 208 cm. It was presented in 1937 in the Great German Art Exhibition in München and is today in the possession of the German Historical Museum Foundation. It was supplemented in the art exhibition by a series of 10 work drawings in mixed media.",

He ran at the University of Minnesota but moved to England after college where he taught school, ran cross-country, and trained in the English club system. In December 1962 Edelen became the first American to better 2-20 for the marathon when he finished fourth at the Asahi Marathon Fukuoka, Japan. This set the stage for his greatest year, 1963. In May 1963 Edelen won the Marathon-to-Athens race over the original Olympic course. Only a few weeks later Edelen became the first American to hold the world marathon record, when he ran 2-14:28 to win the Polytechnic Marathon. Shortly after that race, he also won the prestigious Košice Peace Marathon in Czechoslovakia. Perhaps his greatest race, though, came in the 1964 AAU Marathon, which was the Olympic Trial that year. On a brutally hot day with temperatures in the 90°s (ca~35° C.), Edelen ran 2-24:25.6 and won the race by almost 20 minutes. He was considered to have a chance at an Olympic marathon medal in 1964, but hampered by sciatica, he finished sixth. Edelen ran the 1965 Polytechnic Marathon, which was his last race in England before returning to the United States. He studied at Adams State College in Colorado, earning graduate degrees in clinical psychology and practiced in Colorado for many years.

His father, William McKenzie, emigrated to Canada from Kelso, Scotland, in 1858 and became minister of the Free Church of Scotland in Almonte. Tait McKenzie served England, the United States, and Canada during World War I as a pioneer in the physical and mental rehabilitation of the severely wounded. He was active in organizing the first Philadelphia chapter of the Boy Scouts in 1908. McKenzie was a personal friend of Scouting’s founder, Sir Robert Baden-Powell, and shared with him his belief in the program of Scouting for boys. McKenzie used sculpture to illustrate points before his classes in anatomy. He continued it in the course of his physical education to teach his students and athletes how, for example, to crouch for the sprint or plunge, how to hold the discus, or how to take the hurdles. It became increasingly apparent that his figures had a beauty as well as utility. For years he was a participant and exhibitor in the competition of fine arts at the Olympic Games. One of his most famous sculptures is the “Ideal Scout”, also known as “The Boy Scout”. Some of his sculptures were selected for a series of stamps for the Olympic Games 1976 at Montréal. He was the only artist to take part in five Olympics art competitions, winning a bronze medal in 1932.",Listed in Olympians Who Competed Posthumously () Listed in Olympic Clerics (Minister of the Free Church of Scotland)

Immediately after the Olympics ended he cycled from Helsinki to Paris with the intent of studying to become a painter. Whilst in Paris he became involved in the music scene and, after switching to the kena (a South American flute), became a founder member of the group “Los Incas” which played traditional Andean folk music. The group became quite successful in France, released a number of albums and were even asked to perform at the wedding of Prince Rainier III of Monaco and Grace Kelly. Los Incas’ most famous recording, “El Condor Pasa”, became even better known when Simon and Garfunkel recorded English lyrics over the original track for inclusion on their multi-million selling “Bridge Over Troubled Water” album, although it is not certain if the version included on the album included the musicianship of Carlos Benn. Benn issued a solo album in 1975 and he continued to perform into the 21st century. He never returned to live in Argentina and was resident in France for nearly sixty years.",

He started to work as a journalist and reported for the radio from various European countries. In 1926, he joined Mussolini’s Fascist party and seemed to have been profiting from his closeness to the Fascist movement. In his youth, he was a versatile and avid sportsman, and wrote several sports novels. His most famous work was a football novel from the 1930s, The 90th Minute, for which he won the Italian Football Federation Award in 1932. He was a careful chronicler of the 1934 World Cup, and participated, always as a special envoy for the “Morning,” at the 1936 Berlin Olympics, where his novel Cerchi (Rings) was chosen to represent Italian sports fiction. This novel, in particular, is regarded as serving as a tool for the Fascist propaganda: Bruno and Marino, a javelin thrower and a skier, triumph in their respective disciplines at the Olympics, beating their opponents of other races. The book was first published in Italian in 1934, and a translation into German was published in 1936 under the title Die fünf Ringe (The five rings). After World War II, Ciampitti continued to work for newspapers and magazines, but was cold-shouldered by literary circles and publishers. In Isernia, he worked as a lawyer and acted as president of the tourist board of his home region, Molise. In 1968, he regained attention with his last novel Il Tratturo (The trailing).",

Niemi’s bronze medal win was so surprising that he missed the medal ceremony and received his bronze medal a day later in a special ceremony. Niemi lifted in the B group based on his previous results and, although he led the B group, decided not to stay and watch the A group as never before had a B group lifter medaled in a major international. Niemi went sightseeing and only later that night, while watching track & field competitions at the Los Angeles Coliseum, and using the Electronic Messaging System, did he discover that he had won a bronze medal. Meanwhile, the officials at the weightlifting venue delayed the medal ceremony, searching for Niemi, but, after a few hours delay, they went ahead with the presentation leaving the bronze medal platform empty.

Jack first showed his inherent talent at Bedford School where he stroked the eight and also captained in the rugby football XV. After serving in the Liverpool Scottish Regiment, his Olympic career began in 1920 when he placed second to the American, Jack Kelly, Sr., in the single sculls. At the Paris Olympics four years later, Beresford met another fine American sculler, Garrett Gilmore, and after losing to Gilmore in the heats Beresford reached the final via the repêchage which had been introduced into Olympic competition that year. In the final, Beresford gained revenge for his earlier defeat in the heats by defeating Gilmore quite comfortably to win the first of his three Olympic gold medals. At the 1928 Olympics, Beresford demonstrated his versatility by winning a silver medal in the eights. In the 1930 British Empire Games he represented England and won the silver medal in the single sculls competition. He then won a gold in the coxless fours in 1932, won his third Olympic gold medal in the double sculls in 1936 and was in training for a sixth Olympic appearance when war intervened in 1940. Until Redgrave duplicated the feat, no other British oarsman came close to matching his record of competing in five Olympics and winning a medal in each. Away from the Olympics his record was no less impressive; he won the Wingfield Sculls seven consecutive years (1920-26), the Diamond Sculls four times and the Grand, the Stewards’ and the Silver Goblets twice each. Beresford, who rowed for the Thames, Kingston and Leander clubs, was awarded the Olympic Diploma of merit in 1949. He later managed the British rowing team at the 1952 Olympics, and in 1960, Jack Beresford was awarded a CBE for his services to rowing and that same year his nephew Michael Beresford took part in the coxless fours at the Rome Olympics.

Vlasov was born to the family of military journalist and Comintern agent in China Pyotr Vlasov, who later became the Soviet general consul in Shanghai and Burma. Vlasov took up weightlifting in 1956 while studying at the Zhukovsky Air Force Academy in Moscow and was noticed by Soviet sports officials in 1958, when he won his first medal, a bronze, at the Soviet championships. Vlasov first achieved international prominence in 1959 when he won both the European and World Championships. Between 1959 and 1963 Vlasov was unbeatable and won every competition he entered. He won three more World titles (1961-63) and five more European titles (1960-64). In 1960 Vlasov easily won the gold medal at the Rome Olympics. At the 1964 Olympics he was heavily favored to repeat the victory but was upset by fellow Soviet, Leonid Zhabotynskiy, after which he decided to retire from sports. Domestically Vlasov also won everything there was to win, winning the Soviet title in 1959-63. Vlasov set 34 world records in the super-heavyweight class: seven in the press, seven in the snatch, nine in the clean & jerk, and eleven in the total and was the first person to clean & jerk over 200 kg (440 lbs.). After his retirement from weightlifting Vlasov turned to his first love, writing, and became a renowned novelist and short story writer. Beginning in 1959 his short stories were published in various Soviet newspapers. In 1961 Vlasov won second prize at the best sports story competition organized by the Soviet Writer’s Union. At the 1962 European Championships and the following international competitions Vlasov went not only as an athlete, but also as a special correspondent to the Soviet newspaper Izvestia. Vlasov’s first book, a short story collection entitled Overcoming Yourself, was published shortly before the 1964 Olympics. Since 1968, after retiring from the Soviet Army as a captain, Vlasov has worked as a professional writer. He has published over 15 novels (most notably the Flaming Cross trilogy [1991-93] about life during the 1917 Russian revolution and shortly thereafter) and over 10 short story collections. His works have been translated into several languages, including English. In 1973 he also edited and published his father’s diaries The Special Region of China, 1942-45 about his father’s work in China, which has been translated into six languages, including English and Chinese. From 1985-87 Vlasov worked as president of the Soviet Weightlifting Federation and from 1987-89 Vlasov was president of the Soviet Federation of Athletic Gymnastics (powerlifting). In 1989 he was elected to the Congress of People’s Deputies of the Soviet Union (the highest body of state authority of the Soviet Union from 1989-91) from the Lyublyansky district of Moscow. After the elections he broke with the Communist Party and started the liberal Inter-regional Deputies Group in the Congress, along with Andrey Sakharov, Anatoly Sobchak and Boris Yeltsin. In 1993 Vlasov was elected to the Russian State Duma. In 1996 he entered the Russian presidential elections, but with little success, receiving only 0.02% of the vote (second-to-last among 10 participants). After this poor showing Vlasov retired from politics.",

87614,Marshall Johnston,Male,6 June 1941,177.0,81, Canada,CAN,"Defenseman Marshall Johnston began a lifelong career in ice hockey by spending 1957 through 1959 as a member of the Prince Albert Mintos of the Saskatchewan Junior Hockey League. In 1959 he entered the University of Denver and played on their hockey team, the Pioneers, four his entire four-year stay there. Upon graduation, he was immediately recruited to the Canadian national ice hockey team, which had been formed in 1963, the same year that he left the University of Denver. He joined them for the 1964 Winter Olympics, playing in eight matches, but did not win a medal after a loss to the Soviet Union in the final and the application of a tiebreaking rule that left Canada in fourth place at the tournament. By World Championships rules, however, the team had earned a bronze medal, although they failed to achieve this outright at the 1965 World Champions. Johnston stayed with the team for the next two editions, however, and helped his country bring home bronze during those years. He also joined them for their journey to the 1968 Winter Olympics as team captain, where he played in seven games, scored two goals, and earned Olympic bronze. By that time, however, he was sought after by the National Hockey League and he spent the rest of the 1967-1968 season with the league’s Minnesota North Stars. Unable to maintain a regular presence on the professional team, he split each season between 1968 and 1971 with the North Stars and another team. In 1968 it was the Cleveland Barons of the American Hockey League, in 1969 it was the Iowa Stars of the Central Professional Hockey League, and in 1970 it was the Barons again. In the latter case he suited up for only one game in the NHL, preferring instead to play with the Barons, where his talent was rewarded in 1971 with the Eddie Shore Award, given annually to the league’s best defenseman. Johnston was traded to the Montreal Canadiens in May of 1971, but only a few months later the team passed him on to the California Golden Seals, with whom he would skate out the rest of a playing career that ended in 1974. In his final year he acted as player/coach, and coached the Seals full time the following season. It was this profession that became his calling and he returned to the University of Denver in 1977 to spend four years coaching their ice hockey team. His next stop was the NHL, spending a year with the Colorado Rockies as assistant general manager and coach, and sticking with the team when they became the New Jersey Devils in 1982. During this time, he also coached the Canadian national team at the 1978, 1979, and 1982 World Championships, earning his country two more bronze medals. With the Devils he was coach until 1984, and then director of playing personnel until 1993. After a few years as CEO of CIPRO, a professional scouting network, he joined the Ottawa Senators in 1996 and served as their director of playing personnel until 1999, at which point he was promoted to general manager until leaving the team in 2002. Prior to joining the Carolina Hurricanes as director of professional scouting in 2005, he spent several years as director of player evaluation for the Chicago Blackhawks. After a lifetime of hockey, he finally earned his first Stanley Cup title in 2006 with the Hurricanes. In 1998 he was made a member of the International Ice Hockey Hall of Fame.",Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the World Ice Hockey Championships (0–0–3 1966 Ljubljana bronze; 1967 Wien bronze; 1968 Grenoble (Olympics) bronze)

Doctors were not certain she would walk again but eight weeks later she took her first steps. She attempted a comeback by switching to long-track skating, but it was a brief one. Ziegelmeyer sued the US Olympic Committee over the accident, but did not win. While recovering, Ziegelmeyer began doing some painting work at her father’s fire and restoration company in Arnold. She liked it, and relished the idea of working in a male-dominated field. So, after considering a career in broadcasting, she opened a painting business in July 2000 at the age of 23. The business expanded quickly, owned by Ziegelmeyer and her first husband, Brad Brown, and she now concentrates on running the business while employing painters.",

He was drafted by the Pittsburgh Penguins of the National Hockey League in 1984 and skated 17 seasons with the team until 2006, with breaks from 1994 through 1995, 1997 through 2000 and during the 2004-2005 NHL lockout. In 1985 he won the Calder Memorial Trophy as rookie of the year, as well as a silver medal at the World Championships. In 1986 he won the Lester B. Pearson Award as the league’s top regular season player and in 1988 he broke Wayne Gretzky’s eight-time Hart Memorial Trophy-winning streak as league MVP (Lemieux would win the award twice more in 1993 and 1996). After winning the Conn Smythe Trophy as playoff MVP in 1991 and 1992 (also the years of his first Stanley Cup victories), he had a difficult 1992-1993 season when he was diagnosed with Hodgkin’s lymphoma. He returned later that year, however, and won a second Lester B. Pearson Award, as well as the Bill Masterton Memorial Trophy, which is given to the player who best displays “to a high degree the qualities of perseverance, sportsmanship, and dedication to hockey”. He took his first season off in 1994 to recover from back surgery. Lemieux returned for the 1995-1996 season and captured his third Hart Memorial Trophy, as well as his fifth Art Ross Trophy as the league’s leading scorer (he would win a sixth the following year). He retired in 1997 as the only player to leave with an average points-per-game greater than two and was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame later that year. By 1999 he was majority owner of the financially struggling Penguins and a year later he was back on the ice with his team. In 2002 he made an appearance for Canada at the Winter Olympics as squad captain, where he played in five matches, scored two goals, and took home one of Canada’s first Olympic gold medals in ice hockey in fifty years.

Hales won the GAA 880 yards and mile titles in 1911, and the following year won the Irish AAA mile, and was second in the four miles. He was also runner-up in the mile at the English AAAs at Stamford Bridge. Hales was selected for both the 800 and 1500 at the 1912 Stockholm Olympics, although he was a non-starter in both events. Also that year, he represented Ireland against Scotland and easily won the mile, setting a new Irish record in the process. In 1913 Hales went to the United States to improve his running and soon established a new Irish two miles record at Celtic Park, New York. The outbreak of World War I changed everything, however, and Hales returned to Ireland where, between 1919-21 he and three of his siblings fought in the Ireland War of Independence. One of them, Sean, was to lose his life when executed in a reprisal killing in Dublin in 1922. After his active running career, Bob Hales became a respected coach and is remembered at his former club, Bandon Athletic AC, with the Bob Hales Perpetual Trophy, awarded annually to the winner of their one mile race.

It had crashed in the hills near the Californian town of San Ramon. Investigators recovered Gonzales’ firearm, and discovered that he had taken out a $100,000 life insurance for his wife.

After two fair seasons with the Bucks he was traded to the Kansas City Kings. After graduation from college Ernie Grunfeld felt it necessary to repay the school that had helped him so much. A true measure of the man is that he immediately donated a portion of his first-year NBA salary to start a scholarship fund at the University of Tennessee. While many professional athletes have formed such funds, school officials said they knew of no one who had ever done this in his first year in pro sports. Grunfled played for nine years in the NBA, with Milwaukee, Kansas City, and finishing with the New York Knicks.

The ensuing legal battle with the yellow press “Das Neue Schnell und Aktuell” (The News Fast and Actual) lasted almost two years until it was resolved in favor of Zesner and van Almsick and “Das Neue Schnell und Aktuell” had to retract some of their statements. Nevertheless, the relationship broke down – possibly because of this stress.

In total, he earned 2 golds, two silvers and three bronzes at World Championships. At the 1995 European Championships, he won his only major individual title, winning the 400 freestyle.

Four weeks later, in Ottawa, they even managed to better their Olympic score with a total of thirteen “sixes” to take their fourth world title. Their style of ice dancing enchanted audiences throughout the world and their memorable performances at Sarajevo has made Torvill and Dean one of the legends of Olympic history.

Her first big season was 1996, when she won the United States’ and World Championships. She was favored at the 1998 Winter Olympics in Nagano, but skated poorly in the free skate and lost out to Tara Lipinski (USA), Kwan earning a silver medal. Michelle Kwan took the rare defeat with magnanimity, and came back later in the year to win the World Championships and Goodwill Games. Kwan was also favored at Salt Lake City in 2002, but again had difficulties in the free skate and finished third, with her teammate, Sarah Hughes, winning the gold medal. Kwan was US champion nine times (1996 and eight consecutive from 1998-2005) and World Champion five times (1996, 1998, 2000-01, and 2003).

She skated in ice shows intermittently during her career but made most of her professional earnings from endorsements, of which she had many because of her popularity. After graduating from the University of Denver’s Josef Korbel School of International Studies with a degree in international relations, Kwan entered Tufts Fletcher School of Law and International Diplomacy in 2009, earning a graduate degree in international relations in 2011.

He went to serve in the country of his birth almost immediately but after two and a half years his regiment returned to Lichfield where Walden first began to take football seriously. When the Cheshires were stationed in Belfast, Corporal Walden played for the Irish Army vs. English Army and back in England he subsequently played for the Army vs. Navy in 1909-10 and 1910-11. He was signed up by Bradford City but never played for their first team and he was later on the books of Halifax Town. At the 1912 Olympics, Walden scored six goals in the match against Hungary and a total of eleven goals in the tournament, establishing a British Olympic scoring record which remains unbeaten. Despite his obvious prowess as a goal scorer, Walden’s international honours were limited to his three matches at the Stockholm Olympics. After his playing and Army careers were over Harry Walden became a Music Hall comedian, proving particularly popular in the north of England and even made an appearance in the film “Cup-Tie Honeymoon”.

Her career-best rankings were ninth in the world in the doubles in July 1998, and 19 in the world as a singles player in October 1997. Basuki turned professional in 1990.

Alekseyev, who took up weightlifting at the age of 18, when starting to study at the Arkhangelsk State Technical University, was unbeatable from 1970 to 1978. In 1966, Alekseyev moved to Shakhty, Rostov and started to train under Rudolf Plyukfelder, but did not rose to prominence until after 1968, when he developed his own unique training methods and started to train without a coach. During his career, Alekseyev won gold medals at the 1972 and 1976 Olympic Games and won eight successive gold medals at the World Championships (1970-1977), which equaled the record of Americans John Davis and Tommy Kono. He also won eight European titles (1970-1975, 1977, 1978). Domestically, Alekseyev won seven Soviet titles (1970-1976) and a bronze in 1968. He also won the Soviet Cup in 1970, 1972 and 1974. Between 1970 and 1977, Alekseyev set 80 super-heavyweight world records – 17 in the press, four in the snatch, 32 in the clean & jerk, and 27 in the total lift. He once stated that his goal was to set 100 world records and as Alekseyev received bonuses for each world record, he craftily broke each record by the smallest of margins, making it easier for him to break the record again in the future. Alekseyev was finally defeated at the 1978 World Championships when he competed while injured and did not medal. After recovering from the injury, Alekseyev tried a comeback at the 1980 Olympic Games, but failed to make a successful lift in the snatch and then retired from competition for good. After retirement from competition, Alekseyev worked as a weightlifting coach in Shakhty. He was head coach of the Soviet national weightlifting team from 1990-92, and in 1992 he was also the head coach of the Unified Team’s Olympic weightlifting team. In 1993, Alekseyev was elected to the International Weightlifting Federation Hall of Fame. He was married to a woman aptly named Olimpiada and had two sons, Sergey, who is a procurer and Dmitry, a businessman who also did weightlifting in his youth, having placed fourth at the 1988 Soviet championships.",

His father Karl was an internationally recognized criminal justice teacher, who was appointed to the University of Basel. In 1870 the family moved to Freiburg, and after World War I to Strasbourg and then to Leipzig. Binding studied law and medicine in Tübingen, Heidelberg and Berlin and was a cavalry officer during World War I. He then became more interested in writing and horse racing and became a horse racer and breeder. The writer lived in Buchschlag near Frankfurt am Main, subsequently until his death in Starnberg. After the war he became the “favorite poet of the conservative bourgeoisie” and counted among the upper middle-class and elitist leading thinkers. In 1924 he published the poetic novel _ Reitvorschrift für eine Geliebte_ (Riding Instruction for a Beloved), which earned him the silver medal at the Games of Amsterdam 1928. It consists of “45 short lyricisms composed in highly stylized prose called ‘episodes’ by the author. Titles of the episodes are, for example, ‘horse chatter’, ‘horse riding is saying yes’, ‘choice of horse’, ‘riding out of the yard’, ‘paces of the horse’ or ‘Muhammad’s horses’”. The work was published many times after his death. The illustrated title page of the 1936 edition was designed by Renée Sintenis. In 1933 he defended Adolf Hitler against foreign critics in his writing Antwort eines Deutschen (A German Answer to the World), but within a year, he distanced himself cautiously from these thoughts. Nevertheless, the Nazis still abused him as a willing instrument of propaganda. Rudolf Binding died in 1938 at the age of 70 years due to tuberculosis.",

Németh’s final appearance at international level was finishing sixth at the 1954 European Championships. He was a 12-time Hungarian hammer throw champion (1942-52, 1955).

Lardi and H. Tami. Feierabend and Capadrutt then travelled to the 1936 Winter Olympics where, with Hans Aichele and Hans Bütikofer, they captured a silver medal in the four-man. Feierabend and Joseph Beerli also took silver in the two-man event. This duo then earned bronze at the 1938 World Championships, while Feierabend had his first major international victory a year later, capturing gold in the four-man at the 1939 edition alongside Beerli and the non-Olympians Heinz Cattani and Alphonse Hörning. Feierabend’s career was interrupted by World War II, but he returned in top form at the 1947 World Championships and won both the two- (with Stephan Waser ) and four-man (alongside Beerli, Cattani, and Hörning) events. His next stop was the 1948 Winter Olympics, where he took silver in the two-man with Paul Eberhard and finished fourth in the four-man alongside Heiri Angst, Felix Endrich, and Fritz Waller. The latter event would be the only Olympic one in which Feierabend would fail to medal over his career. At the 1949 World Championships, Feierabend and Angst earned silver in the two-man and, with Waller and Werner Spring, bronze in the four-man. One year later Feierabend and Waser won the two-man and, alongside Albert Madörin and Romi Spada, earned silver in the four-man. After coming up empty at the 1951 World Championships, Feierabend and Waser captured bronze in both the two- and four-man events at the 1952 Winter Olympics, aided in the latter by Madörin and André Filippini. Feierabend did not receive any medals at the 1953 World Championships, but then won the four-man the following year with Angst, Gottfried Diener, and Harry Warburton. His last major international championship was the 1955 World Championships, where he and Warburton took gold in the two-man and silver in the four-man alongside Aby Gartmann and Rolf Gerber. Feierabend retired from active competition with five Swiss national championships under his belt. By career he was involved in his father’s bobsled-building business and, together, they built the first all-steel bobsleigh.","Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the World Bob & Skeleton Championships (FIBT/IBSF) (6–3–3 1935 St. Moritz bronze: Four-man; 1938 St. Moritz bronze: Two-man; 1939 Cortina d'Ampezzo gold: Four-man; 1947 St. Moritz gold: Two-man and Four-man; 1949 Lake Placid silver: Two-man, bronze: Four-man; 1950 Cortina d'Ampezzo gold: Two-man, silver: Four-man; 1954 Cortina d'Ampezzo gold: Four-man; 1955 St. Moritz gold: Two-man, silver: Four-man)"

He won the New York and Chicago Golden Gloves titles in both 1950 and 1951. At the 1952 Olympic trials Lee again lost in the finals of the heavyweight division against Eddie Sanders. However, Lee was small for a heavyweight and the teams coaches felt he could make the light-heavyweight limit and asked him to do so. He managed to lose the weight and outshone Chuck Spieser in training, so Lee was entered in the light-heavyweight division. Not only did he win the gold medal, but Lee won the Val Barker Trophy, the award given at the Olympics to the best boxer in any division. At the 1955 Pan American Games he also won the bronze medal in the heavyweight class. During World War II, Lee was selected in 1943 as a member of the famed Tuskegee Airmen but served only on a ground crew because of a speech defect. He later attended Howard University and joined the ROTC Program, eventually becoming a lieutenant-colonel. He eventually earned a masters’ degree in education from Federal City College (now the University of District Columbia) and an ABD from Catholic University.

Meadows again had some close contests with Sefton in 1937 and in May they both raised the world record to 14-8½ (4.48) and three weeks later, the “Heavenly Twins,” as they were known, took the record up to 14-11 (4.54). The occasion was the Pacific Coast Conference Meet in Los Angeles and we might have seen history’s first 15-foot vault that day but Meadows and Sefton were unable to continue the competition because the standards had been raised to their maximum and the bar could be raised no higher.

They played their first match, under the name of Backwell House, in 1878 when Theodore and five siblings were joined by five cousins in the XI. In their 87 seasons of existence, all members of the Backwell House team were either a grandson, great-grandson, great-great-grandson, or great-great-great-grandson of Edward Robinson. They played matches against neighbouring villages like Flax Bourton, Yatton, Long Ashton and others, and in 1891 they played an historic match against a team made up entirely of members of the famous Grace family, and Theodore bowled out the legendary W. G. Grace for 12 runs. Theodore played in all 105 Backwell Hall games up to the outbreak of World War I, and replaced Arthur Robinson as captain in 1904. As an archer, Theodore was a member of the Backwell and District Archery Club, as were fellow 1908 Olympians Harold James and Sarah Leonard. Despite achieving the most golds in the Double York Round, Robinson could only finish seventh, while James outscored him by five points to finish sixth. From 100 yards, however, Robinson was second-best scorer behind the eventual gold medallist William Dod. Less than a week after completion of the Olympic competition, Robinson finished sixth in the National Championships at Oxford. In 1929 Robinson and his sister Isabel, who was also an excellent archer, presented playing fields to the people of Backwell.

He continued to compete while he earned his Bachelor’s of Law, joining the Al-Ahly Sporting Club in 1922. In his first game, an international match for Egypt’s Sultan Cup against an English aviation squad, he scored the winning goal in his country’s 2-1 victory. At the age of only 17 he became captain of both Al-Ahly and the Egyptian National Team and was sent with them to the 1924 Summer Olympics. As this was at the same time as his law exams, however, his father at first refused to send his son abroad, fearing for his future. A decree from Egyptian Prime Minster Saad Zaghloul after a personal appeal, however, permitted him to take the exams abroad, allowing El-Tetsch to join the squad in Paris. In the end it did not matter, however, as he is not recorded as having played in either of the team’s two games at the tournament. He appeared twice more at the Olympics, finishing fourth with his squad at the 1928 Games and joint ninth at the 1936 edition. Internationally, he scored four goals at the 1928 Olympics and five in the qualifiers to earn Egypt their first appearance at the 1934 World Cup in Italy. He retired from the sport in 1940, at the height of his career, so that he would always be remembered at his prime. He took up field hockey as a hobby and managed Al-Ahly for a while prior to serving as the secretary-general of the Egyptian Olympic Committee from 1956-59. Mokhtar El-Tetsch Stadium in Cairo, the home of Al-Ahly for many years, was named in his honor.",

It was considered a landmark event, as South Africa was re-admitted to the Olympics in 1992, after years of apartheid, and Tulu and Meyer, a white South African, ran a victory lap together. Although Tulu had won the World Junior title in the 10,000 in 1990 and the 10,000 m gold at the 1991 All-African Games and silver at the 1991 IAAF World Cross-Country Championships, she had not been considered an Olympic favorite.

Nonetheless he is on a very short list of wrestlers who have won an Olympic medal at both styles of wrestling in the same year. Neo took up wrestling in 1928 and first competed internationally at the 1931 European Greco-Roman Championships, where he was fourth. Neo missed the 1932 Olympics, and possible medals, because Estonia did not send an Olympic team to the 1932 Olympics due to the Great Depression. Thus Neo won his first international tournament medal, a middleweight silver, at the 1934 European Greco-Roman Championships. In 1935 he won bronze medalss in light-heavyweight at both the European Greco-Roman and Freestyle Championships and, at the 1936 Olympics, won silver in freestyle and bronze in Greco-Roman. After the Olympics, Neo won silver at the 1937 European Greco-Roman Championships and bronze at the 1939 edition. Domestically Neo won 12 Estonian titles: in 1934 in Greco-Roman middleweight, in 1935-37 and 1939 in Greco-Roman light-heavyweight, and in 1929, 1931-34, and 1936-37 in freestyle light-heavyweight. Neo retired from sports during World War II and emigrated to Sweden. In Estonia Neo had worked as a car driver, continuing to work as a driver in Sweden, and he later owned a car repair garage.","Listed in Olympic Wrestling Medalists in Both Freestyle and Greco-Roman (1936 Freestyle Light-heavyweight Silver; 1936 Greco-Roman Light-heavyweight Bronze.)

In 1928 Mező won a gold medal for literature in the Arts Competition for his work Az olympiai játékok története (History of the Olympic Games). As the Dutch catalog notes, the jury only received “fragments”. The book was published in Hungarian in 1929, in English the same year, and in 1930 (with a preface by Theodor Lewald) and in 1935 in German editions comprising two appendices, a statistical listing of the names of the champions of the ancient Olympics and a short description of The Olympic Games of the Modern Era by Franz Miller. Beginning in 1932 he served as Secretary-General of the Hungarian Olympic Society, an organization of Olympic medal winners. After the war, he was the President of the Hungarian Scientific Sports and Physical Culture Association (1945-46), Head Supervisor of sports at the Ministry of Religion and Education (1945-48), and also worked as an Assistant Under-Secretary at the Ministry of Culture (1945-1953). In 1956 he published the important work The Modern Olympic Games, which attempted to make some sense of the names of the Olympics medalists in the early years of the movement. He owned an important collection of books, as well as an Olympic Museum, and tried several times in vain to reintroduce the art competitions. Mező was co-opted onto the IOC in January 1948 and served until his death in November 1961. Even his personal life was closely attached to the Olympic Movement, noting that one of his daughters was named “Olympia”.",

43430,Ben Pon,Male,9 December 1936,,, Netherlands,NED,"Bernardus Marinus “Ben” Pon was born on 9 December 1936 in Leiden, but he grew up in Amersfoort. His father, Ben Pon Sr., was a car dealer and in 1947 he became the first importer of Volkswagens, after already showing interest in the VW Beetle before the war. The Beetles became a success in the Netherlands, and Pon Sr. also started importing them into the United States, where they eventually also became popular. But Pon Sr. is probably even more famous as the inventor of the Volkswagen Transporter, better known as the Volkswagen Van. His company still exists, and still imports Volkswagens. By 1961, his son had begun racing sportscars, entering in several World Championship events. His car – not very surprising considering his father’s job – was a Porsche 356B Carrera, which he drove together with his friend, Graaf Carel Godin de Beaufort (NED). They achieved several top three classifications in their class, and Pon also won the GT1.6 class at the 1961 24 Hours of Le Mans, riding with Herbert Linge (GER) at that occasion. Since 1957, his friend Godin de Beaufort had been racing in a few Formula 1 races per season, driving Porsches for his own team, Ecurie Maarsbergen. In 1961, he had begun to race the entire season, and for the first race of the 1962 season, the Dutch GP at Zandvoort, he offered Pon to drive a second Porsche for his team. The Porsche was outpowered by the rest of the field, and Pon qualified as 18th (out of 20). Nevertheless, he took off quickly for his first – and last – Formula 1 GP. In the third lap, Pon had a heavy crash, his Porsche flipping over and throwing Pon out. He was lucky to get away without any injuries, but he swore never to race a single-seater again. Instead, he continued racing sportscar races for Porsche with some success, and he finished 8th overall and second in his class at Le Mans in 1964 with Henk van Zalinge (NED). That same year, Godin de Beaufort died of injuries sustained during the training for the German GP. In 1965, Pon was one of the founders the Dutch Racing Team, although he did not race that much himself anymore. Still, he won the S2.0 Class (7th overall) at Le Mans in 1967, together with Vic Elford (GBR) – his last big result before quitting racing the next year. At the 1972 Munich Olympics, Ben Pon formed the Dutch skeet team together with Eric Swinkels (silver medallist in 1976). However, the Dutch team performed disappointingly, with Pon finishing in 31st, and Swinkels in 35th. In the 1980s, Pon was bought out of his father’s enterprise and set up an investment fund, as well as a wine distribution company and a winery in Carmel Valley, producing Bernardus wines. In the last years of his life, he sold his majority stakes in his companies. As a gift, one of his business partners named a golf course after him, Bernardus Golf in Cromvoirt (NED). At the time of his death in 2019, Pon was listed among the 500 wealthiest Dutchmen, with an estimated net value of €280 million (2018).","Listed in Olympians Who Participated in 24 Hours of Le Mans Races (6 races - 1961 (10th), 1962 (DNF), 1963 (DNF), 1964 (8th), 1965 (DNF), and 1967 (7th) with Porsche) Listed in Olympians Who Participated in Formula One Races (1 race - 0 points (1962) with Porsche) Listed in Olympians With a Net Worth > $100M (€290M (Quote 500, 2019))"

As newspapers proclaimed him to be the next Rik Van Steenbergen or Rik van Looy, Vanden Berghen turned professional in 1961. He then suffered his first setback, having to deal with a tapeworm costing him much of the season. The following year, he won stages in Paris-Nice as well as the Tour de France, but also suffered from a lung illness, putting him in the hospital for a month. He was unable to ride for most of the 1963 season, as a cyst between his legs put him out for several months. After having to deal with another injury (knee), as well as professional teams being unwilling to pay his salary, Vanden Berghen was forced to retire and look for another job. Vanden Berghen held all kinds of positions, from construction work to food preparation, but never was able to hold on to a job for long. In 1971, he suffered a blowout while driving and crashed into another car. Having suffered severe injuries, he was kept in a coma for six weeks, and suffered from hip problems for years after. By then, his wife and children had left him. When Vanden Berghen refused to fulfill his alimony payments, he was imprisoned in 1980. Determined not to be found for future payments, he became a vagrant upon his release, living in homeless shelters and doing odd jobs. Although he eventually settled down in an affordable house, Vanden Berghen remained ill-fated in life. He suffered several serious injuries, such as a fall at a construction site and another traffic accident. In 2004, he was conned out of his life savings by a younger woman pretending to be romantically interested in him. His tragic life ended at age 82.",

In 1899, he became a member of the Berlin Secession in 1899 and was on the Board in 1906-07. He painted harbor scenes in Hamburg and the Baltic Sea, in particular, and city scenes of Berlin. Hübner came from a family of artists and studied in Karlsruhe and München. In 1913 he moved back to Lübeck and joined the Free Berlin Secession. Later he spent the summers in Travemünde on the Baltic Sea and then lived there for a number of years. In 1919, he returned to Berlin and was influenced by the impressionists having his breakthrough after returning from a stay in Italy. Hübner later taught at the Academy of Visual Arts and was appointed a full member of the Prussian Art Academy. In the last decade of his life, he hesitantly adopted more modern tendencies in art. When his house was confiscated after World War II, his artistic estate and collections of contemporary art vanished. His brother Heinrich also became a painter. Hübner posthumously took part in the 1932 Olympic art competitions as he had died a few months earlier. A 70 x 94 cm painting (oil on canvas) shows a Summer Day on the Baltic coast. It was painted as early as 1909 and is in the collection of the Staatliche Kunsthalle Karlsruhe. At least one other painting is known bearing the same title, also painted shortly before World War I.

It was nearly a triple celebration for the Brown family, because their other brother Ralph, a AAA 440 yard hurdle champion, was forced to miss the Games through injury.

921672,George Mallory,Male,18 June 1886,,, Great Britain,GBR,"George Mallory was the only man to go on all three Everest expeditions in 1921, 1922 and 1924. Prior to the 1921 reconnaissance expedition, Mallory was little known in mountaineering circles although he was acknowledged as a fine rock climber by the Alpine Club, of which he became a member in 1910. Mallory was educated at Winchester College before winning a scholarship to Magdalene College, Cambridge. After taking his degree he became a schoolmaster. It was during his time at Winchester that a teacher took Mallory and some friends on a holiday to the Alps, and Mallory showed a great talent for climbing local peaks and was offered admission into the Alpine Club. During World War I, Mallory served on the Western Front but, as soon as the hostilities ended, he returned to his beloved Alps and climbed largely in the Mount Blanc region. When he got the call to join the 1921 Everest party, he was by then a master at Charterhouse School, but quit to join the expedition. Mallory proved to be such a valuable member of the reconnaissance team that he was selected for the full expedition the following year and, along with Edward Norton and Howard Somervell, the three men reached a record 26,985 feet (8,225m), without the aid of oxygen. Mallory was probably the most famous member of Charles Granville Bruce’s 1922 Everest expedition. It was during the 1924 expedition, however, also led by General Bruce originally, until he contracted malaria on his way to base camp and handed over command to Edward Norton, that Mallory lost his life. Along with climbing partner Sandy Irvine, the two men were last seen about 800 feet (244m) from the summit of the world’s tallest mountain. Mallory’s body was found 75 years later by a party that set out for the purpose of the finding the remains of the two climbers. There is much doubt, speculation, and uncertainty as to whether the two men reached the summit before their demise. The one legacy Mallory left were the immortal words “simply because it was there” when asked why he had the desire to climb Everest. They are words now uttered by mountaineers all over the world when their exploits are queried.",Listed in Olympians Who Have Climbed Mount Everest (Attempted to climb Everest in 1924.

Klim took up athletics seriously after service with the Soviet Navy in 1955, but was noticed by Soviet sports officials only in 1963, after winning bronze at the Znamensky Brothers Memorial, winning the Riga Cup and taking silver at the 1963 Soviet Championships. Klim was selected to the Soviet national team and was sent to the 1964 Tokyo Olympics, which was his first international. Although Klim had established himself as one of the top hammer throwers of the world at the time of 1964 Olympics, he was not considered as the main favorite for gold. After three rounds at the Olympic Games, Klim was third behind Gyula Zsivótzky of Hungary and world record holder Hal Connolly, but then threw 69.74 in the fourth round to win a surprising gold medal. After his Olympic victory, Klim established himself as the best hammer thrower in the world by winning the European Championships in 1966, the European Cup in 1965 and 1967, three Soviet Championships (1966-1968), and went to the 1968 Olympics as the clear favorite for Olympic gold. But at the Olympics, Klim was beaten by Zsivótzky, who had been his closest rival between the Olympics and whom, despite holding the world record, Klim had beaten every previous time in head-to-head competition. After the Olympics, Klim won silver at the 1969 European Championships and his fourth Soviet title in 1971. In 1969, Klim also set his only world record (74.52) and won the hammer throw at the Znamensky Brothers Memorial five times (1964, 1966, 1968-69, 1972). After finishing his sporting career in 1973, Klim became an athletics coach and referee.

It transpired that he had shot and wounded his mother, who was staying with him at the time, before turning the gun on himself and firing a single shot into his left temple. The coroner recorded a verdict of “Suicide during temporary insanity”. At the time of his death, Chaney was penning a book about his life as a flying officer on the “front line” during World War I. Also, there were reports about him living with a younger woman at the Baron’s Court address, while his wife and seven children were living away in the country at Wokingham, near Reading.","Listed in Olympians Who Committed Suicide (Committed suicide by shooting himself in the temple during temporary insanity, according to the coroner's report.)"

In 1933 his plans were ultimately rejected.

Together with his compatriots Henry Vincent Hubbard and Robert Wheelwright, Lay founded a landscape agency in New York.

As a 14-year-old he was sent to the Belle Arti tennis club in Roma to do some plumbing work, and playing there at the time was Prince Orsini, who invited Di Domenico to act as a ball-boy. He went from ball-boy to becoming a good standard player and, despite being mentored by sports doctor Antonio Dal Monte, Di Domenico learned most of his tennis by watching Nicola Pietrangeli playing in local clubs. In 1965, Di Domenico won the third category championship and, at the age of 21, went to the federal technical centre at Formia. At the last amateur edition of the Internazionali d’Italia in 1968, Di Domenico achieved his best-ever performance, reaching the last 16, where he was beaten by the American Marty Riessen. At the Olympic Games in Mexico City that year, tennis was a demonstration sport and Di Domenico took part in all three events, losing in his first match on each occasion. In the Open era, Di Domenico’s best result was in reaching the third round at Roland Garros in 1969, where he lost to Australian Roy Emerson in four sets. Di Domenico was a member of the Italian Davis Cup team where he had a 3-3 record. He competed twice in the doubles with Adriano Panatta, and they enjoyed a memorable win over the Czech pair of Jan Kodes and Jan Kukal. After ending his career as a player in 1980, Di Domenico spent 17 years in charge of women’s tennis at the Latina technical centre, where he produced a generation of strong tennis players such as Rita Grande, Raffaella Reggi and Silvia Farina, amongst others.",

While at Natzwiler he befriended a Norwegian prisoner, Osmund Faremo, who had been a member of the Norwegian resistant group, Milorg. Faremo later became a prominent Norwegian politician, serving in the Norwegian Parliament, promoting Norwegian-Yugoslav relations, and serving as a Norwegian member of the Helsinki Committee on Human Rights. But Faremo likely survived his time at Natzwiler through the efforts of Émile Frantz. In 1997 Faremo published a book in Norwegian Takk for livet. Emil, which can be translated to “Thank you for my life, Emil.” In the book he described being helped by Frantz several times when he was on the verge of dying, with Frantz sneaking him extra food rations and doing some light work for him.

17927,George Thorne,Male,3 September 1846,,, Great Britain,GBR,"So who is George Thorne? We wish we were more certain.

At that club, he won four monthly medals between 1900-03, off handicaps starting around 13 and ending at a 9. He also played in several club matches against other clubs. The identity of this athlete has been difficult. After checking many sources, and following a thread on the athlete, we are fairly certain he was an Australian who moved to England. However, there are two possible George Thorne’s from that area that fit the description, and there is a third, more remote possibility, that he was George Robson Thorne of the Midlothian Club in Chicago, who was the President of the Western Golf Association in 1900. Although he was in Europe in the summer of 1900, he was back in Chicago by mid-September, and marshalled at the US Open in 1900 at Chicago Golf Club, so this golfer is not the Chicagoan George Thorne. The Australian George Thorne is noted to have returned to Weston-super-Mare only three months before his death. However, there is also evidence that he was in Weston-super-Mare in 1900-01 from evidence concerning his daughter.",

He then focused more on Alpine skiing, winning the downhill, slalom and the combination of the legendary Lauberhorn race in 1934. His last Swiss Alpine Championship was in the downhill in 1938. Rubi also succeeded in competitions combining Nordic and Alpine skiing. Originally from Grindelwald he later moved to Wengen and continued to compete into the mid-1940s. He was the uncle of Alpine skier and 1952 Winter Olympian Fred Rubi. Besides skiing, Adolf was a well-known mountain guide, obtaining his license in 1926.

He joined the Charlottetown-based Abegweit Amateur Athletic Association after winning an international hexathalon contest in the city in 1920. He began competing with the club in 1921 and quickly built up a reputation for his athletic talents at a time when track and field was popular both locally and nationally by winning the 120 yard hurdles event at that year’s Maritime Championships. By 1924 he held a Maritime record in the broad jump, had won the triple jump event at the 1923 Canadian Championships, and was hailed as one of Canada’s best hopes for a medal at the 1924 Summer Olympics. At the Olympic trials he made the 400 m hurdles team, despite having never run in the event previously nor experienced any endurance training. Yet, as the Summer Games arrived, his times were equal to that of Canada’s top hurdler of the time, Warren Montabone. He became only the second person from Prince Edward Island to compete in the Olympic Games, after his coach Bill Halpenny, and it was his first time competing outside of the Maritimes. In the 400 m hurdles event he placed third in his heat during the first round and was eliminated. He also competed in the triple jump competition, finishing fourteenth in a field of twenty competitors. After his Olympic experience he continued to compete and set a new Maritime record in the 120 yard hurdles in 1925, winning the hop, step, and jump and running broad jump events later that year at the Canadian National Championships. He continued his victory streak through the 1926 Maritime Championships, winning three events, but was not selected for the Canadian delegation to the 1928 Summer Olympics. By the time of the Olympic trials in 1927 he had a steady job at the Royal Bank in Charlottetown and a year later he moved to Toronto, ending his athletic career in favor of beginning a new one as a lumber broker. He was inducted into the Prince Edward Island Sports Hall of Fame in 1969. Personal Bests: 400H – unknown; TJ – unknown.",

It was presented to ski jumper Stanisław Marusarz as the sportsman of the year in Poland in 1938. Marusarz’s father saved the trophy through World War II, and it was re-discovered in 2000-01 at an exhibition in the Museum of Sport and Tourism in Warszawa, as Marusarz’ trophies were presented.

He was a promising skater, placing third in the 500 m at the national junior Championships in 1940, until World War II stopped his skating career for five years. In 1942 he married and fathered a daughter, but unfortunately his wife died from tuberculosis three years later, and he had to move with his little daughter to his parents house. In the autumn of 1945 he started to train for speed skating again, and became Norway’s top sprinter in the years after World War II. When Finn Helgesen became Olympic 500 m champion in 1948, he was a widower and single father. His time, 43.1, was a new Olympic Record and a tenth ahead of the trio sharing the silver medal. Four years later, he skated the same time as Gordon Audley and Arne Johansen, who shared the bronze medal, but because Audley had beaten Helgesen in their pair, Helgesen placed fifth. A real sprinter, Helgesen was not good enough to skate for Norway at the international all-round competitions, but at the Norwegian Championships, he won the 500 m twice, in 1947 and 1949, and made the podium five times. In 1952, he won an unofficial sprint competition held during the Norwegian Championships, with the best time for 500 m. He ended his skating career in 1956, aged 36, and was later speed skating trainer for young skaters in his club Oslo Skøiteklub for nearly 20 years.

Born into a rich family as an only son, after studying law and letters at the University of Pisa, he became a journalist with La Gazzetta dello Sport where he was deputy director from 1919-24 in one of the most turbulent periods in the life of the daily newspaper. He later worked with Secolo (1924-26) and then Corriere della Sera (1927-28). Ferretti was made a deputy of the Italian Kingdom from 1924-40 with the P.N.F. (National Fascist Party) and in December 1925 took over the presidency of CONI (Italian Olympic Committee). His first charge was to send a strong team to the 1928 Amsterdam Olympics. From 1926 Ferretti was Commissioner of the FIGC (Italian Football Federation) where he introduced the First National League. On 17 September 1928 he was promoted by Mussolini to head the official press office, a role in which he expanded state censorship. Ferretti fiercely opposed the alliance with Hitler and his racial laws, and in 1939 he was expelled from the PNF. After a brief period in France where he was hosted by the elderly socialist mayor of Lyon, Edouard Herriot, he was called back to Italy after the start of World War II under penalty of desertion, and given the rank of colonel. After the armistice of 8 September 1943, he joined the Italian Social Republic (Salò Republic) and in the difficult days of April 1945 he was helped in Milano by Giuseppe Corbari, the former secretary of CONI in the 1930s. After the war, Ferretti again took part in politics, joining the M.S.I. (Movimento Sociale Italiano), a right-wing party that supported Fascist principles. He was a Senator of the Republic from 1953-68 and during this period he was a member of the Organizing Committee of the Roma Olympic Games. In these years he abandoned his former militant journalism and wrote many books like Lo Sport (1949) and three years later he published Olimpiadi, a historical essay about the Olympic Games. In 2005 the journalists Fausto Pettinelli and Giampaolo Grassi wrote a study about Ferretti’s activities during Fascism entitled Lando Ferretti, il giornalista di Mussolini. Olimpiadi (776 B.C. - 1952 A.D.) was also the book which Ferretti submitted for the 1952 Art Exhibition. It contains 31 illustrations and was published with 269 pages by Garzanti in Milan. Later, extended versions were published, covering the games until 1960.",Brother-in-law of Isaline Crivelli

Gogay nevertheless was a reserve for the lightweight division at the Paris Olympics that year. Early in 1925, he was one of four Olympians, along with Harry Mitchell, Patrick O’Hanrahan, and Jack Elliott to visit the United States and take part in a series of contests against the Americans. A few months later, Gogay came close to his only ABA title when he lost in the lightweight final to Sergeant Viney of the Royal Signal Corps. In November 1925, Gogay turned professional and joined the Joe Morris stable at Premierland and was a stable-mate of such crack boxers as Johnny Curley and Teddy Baldock. Gogay’s professional career was a short one, and after losing his undefeated record barely 12 months after his début, he retired and concentrated on coaching, becoming one of the instructors at the London Polytechnic BC in 1928. Throughout his career, as both an amateur and professional, Gogay continued to work as a boilermaker up to the outbreak of World War II when, in 1941, he went to live and work in Portugal as a physical training instructor with the Mocidade Portuguesa (Portuguese Youth Movement).",

Wu represented the Overseas Chinese at the 7th National Games in Shanghai breaking the national record in the 100 m freestyle with a time of 1:03.3 min. At the 1948 London Olympics, he was eliminated in the heats. In 1951, Wu Chuanyu took second place in the men’s 100m backstroke and third place in the men’s 100m butterfly in the 3rd World Youth Festival Swimming Competition in East-Berlin, representing Indonesia. He did not return to Indonesia, settling in People’s Republic of China. For political reasons, the Chinese delegation arrived too late to compete in the 1952 Helsinki Olympics. Only Wu had a chance to participate in the heats of the 100m backstroke, but failed to qualify for the semi-finals. After some training with a Russian coach, he won the 100 m backstroke at the 4th World Youth Festival in București in 1953. One year later, at the unofficial World Student Games in Budapest, Wu placed second in the same event setting another national record of 1:06.4 min in the 100 m butterfly. He then returned to China to attend the first meeting of the First National People’s Congress. Flying back to Budapest, where the rest of the team had remained in a trainings camp, Wu’s plane crashed on the way from Irkutsk to Novosibirsk. Due to adverse weather conditions, the flight was redirected to Krasnoyarsk, and negligence of the local ground staff and an error of the crew led to a misjudgement of the flight position. All six crew members and 13 passengers were killed when the plane crashed into the side of Mount Sivukha. In 1984, Wu was named “outstanding athlete since the founding of the People’s Republic of China” being the first athlete to have the People’s Republic of China’s flag raised and the anthem played at a major sporting event outside the motherland.

Kotrba was also a graphic artist and illustrator, illustrating books and designing bookplates and stamps. His graphics are distinguished by their mature drawing, creative curtness and the partially grotesque humor. His most important patron was 1932 Olympian Max Švabinský. Kotrba was himself an active rider, trainer and judge of riding competitions and had contact with numerous stud farms. Probably his two works for the 1948 Art Competitions were paintings, showing feats of the Spanish Riding School.

His life was not all happy as in September 1921, during a hunting trip, Gravelotte accidentally shot and killed his young son, René, when his gun went off after it slipped from his hands and the butt of the weapon hit the floor with such force that it discharged a bullet, striking René on the right side of his face.

He turned professional with the Jolljceramica team in 1977 and immediately attracted attention by winning a stage in the Giro de Sicilia. Following that, Martinelli won stages in the Giro d’Italia at Piediluco (1978), Treviso (1979), and Gatteo a Mare (1980). He also won the Vinarós stage of the Vuelta a España in 1980, beating Ireland’s Sean Kelly in the sprint. Martinelli also won the Milano-Torino semi-classic in 1981. After an eight-year professional career, Martinelli’s experience paved the way for him to become a sports director. He took over the helm of the Mercatone Uno team and, during a five-year spell, enjoyed success in both the 1998 Giro d’Italia and Tour de France thanks to Marco Pantani, “Il Pirata”. Martinelli then enjoyed more Giro success after taking charge of the Saeco squad when Gilberto Simoni won the race in 2002 and 2003, and Damiano Cunego won in 2004. Martinelli then moved to Lampre, and in 2009 had an unsuccessful time with team Aeronautica Militare-Amica Chips.

Arguably his most notable accomplishment came in 1958, when he jumped 442 feet, which was at the time the third longest jump on record. After retiring from active competition, he coached the national team from 1969 through 1970 and managed the squad at the 1970 World Championships.

With her husband Duncan Phillips (1886-1966), she visited Europe, especially France in 1923, which sharpened her awareness of the possibilities inherent in impressionism and post-impressionism, as she studied Cézanne and Renoir. Phillips painted primarily landscapes and still life works. She and her husband collected artworks and Marjorie served as Associate Director of the Phillips Collection. After the death of her husband, she eventually became director. Two well-known paintings by Phillips, depicting scenes of Baseball, were created long after World War II and thus do not qualify to be her 1932 entry. However, the painting already was on loan from what was then called the Phillips Memorial Gallery.

At 15 he switched from being a passenger to being an oarsman and was a junior international less than two years later. His first successes at world level came as a member of a coxed four as he won a bronze medal at the 1997 World Championships. After graduating from Nottingham Trent University he joined the national training squad on a full-time basis and began to row as part of the national eight. The crew began to rise up the world rankings and made a breakthrough at the 1999 World Championships where they placed second. The next year they improved on this feat and Trapmore was part of the Olympic championship winning crew. Unlike many of his Sydney crewmates he elected to continue rowing and won a world title in 2002 with the British coxed four. A back injury sustained in 2003 brought a premature end to his rowing career and he switched to coaching. In 2010 he was appointed head coach of Cambridge University Boat Club.,

47111,Denise Newman,Female,19 February 1924,,, Great Britain,GBR,"Denise Newman’s family moved from London to Cairo, Egypt when she was very young, and Denise took to diving at an early age at the Maadi Sporting Club, winning her first tournament at the age of six. One of her earliest coaches there was Ahmed Ibrahim Kamel, a 1936 Olympian in diving. Under his guidance she won the 1937 national Open Swimming Championships and, less than two months later, the Open Diving Championships. She continued to win championships and set records both before and after her permanent return to England in 1938. World War II put an end to her hopes of competing at the 1940 Summer Olympics, however, and saw her sent to Abadan, Iran to live with her family for several years. She returned to England in 1943 and joined the Air Ministry. Already fluent in French and Arabic, she was sent to learn Japanese, which she did in six months, before joining the Japanese cipher section at the famous Bletchley Park intelligence centre. After the end of the war Newman married Vyvyan St Aubyn Hubbard but, unusually for the times, returned to competitive sport as a diver. At the 1948 Olympics she competed at platform diving but a muscle injury suffered in the third round ruined her chances of a high placement and she finished 11th of the 15 competitors. She continued to compete for several years and even tried out for the 1952 Games, but raising a family left her with little time to train and her third placement in the trials was not sufficient for her to make the team. She retired from active competition shortly thereafter. Newman began sailing for pleasure in the late 1950s and worked towards professional sailing qualifications in the late 1960s as a potential way to earn money as she approached the impending end of her marriage. She joined the Royal Navy Auxiliary Service in 1970 and, in her 19 year service, she rose in the ranks to command her own vessel, the training vessel Portisham. During this time she also set up her own sailing school and taught navigation and seamanship at Chichester College, beginning in 1973. In 1988 she competed in the Carlsberg Single-Handed Transatlantic Yacht Race although a series of mechanical failures meant that she could only finish 71st of the 95 starters.",

In December 1925 he moved to London to train as a teacher. While studying at Strawberry Hill College, he played with London Caledonians – one of England’s leading amateur teams of the time. He assisted the Caledonians to second place in the Isthmian League, also winning the London Senior Cup. Fulton returned to Belfast Celtic in May 1926 and gained a City Cup medal. He then made a single appearance for Dundalk in September 1926 while waiting to return to London to undertake his exams. Once qualified, Fulton returned home to re-sign for Larne. He quickly drew the attentions of the Irish FA’s selection committee, and was capped for the first time in February 1928. Bertie had made his Amateur International debut as a Belfast Celtic player in 1925. In all he appeared 20 times for the Amateurs until 1938 scoring one goal, to become the most capped player. Fulton was back with Belfast Celtic for the 1928-29 season, finishing as runner-up in the Irish Cup. The following season Fulton was back in the Ireland team against Wales. From then until the outbreak of World War II, Fulton was Ireland’s regular left-back, earning 21 caps for Northern Ireland between 1928 and 1938 in addition to his appearances for the Ireland Amateur team. In 1936 Fulton was selected for the Great Britain team for the Berlin Olympics playing both matches as left-back. He was the first Northern Ireland footballer to play for Great Britain. He rejected all offers to turn professional, e.g. from Manchester United before the 1936 Olympics, in a career spanning more than 900 games. The 1942-43 season was to be Fulton’s last as a Belfast Celtic player. With this club he won the Irish League 8 times, Irish Cup 3 times, and City Cup 8 times. A third spell back at his hometown Larne in 1943/44, brought Fulton’s playing career to a close, and he later returned to Belfast Celtic to coach the second eleven. He continued to teach at McKenna Memorial School and became the principal at St. Comgalls, both in Larne.",

Only five women have since won more titles (up to and including 2021): Dorothy Lambert Chambers (1903-14), Helen Wills Moody (1927-38), Martina Navratilova (1978-90), Steffi Graf (1988-96), and Serena Williams (2002-16). Hillyard, as Blanche Bingley, played in the first women’s event at Wimbledon in 1884 and lost to Maud Watson in the semi-final. Bingley reached the first of her 13 singles finals the following year, only to lose again to Watson. Bingley beat Watson in 1886, however, to capture her first title. Bingley married fellow tennis player George Hillyard one week after her third consecutive Wimbledon final appearance in 1887. Five days later the pair teamed up to win the mixed doubles at the Middlesex Championships. Blanche won her record sixth Wimbledon title at the expense of Charlotte Cooper (for the third time) in 1900, and the following year made her 13th and final appearance in a Wimbledon final, losing to Cooper, who was then known as Charlotte Sterry. In 1912, and 28 years after her Wimbledon début, Hillyard reached the semi-final, but lost to Ethel Larcombe 6-1, 6-0. Hillyard eventually bowed out in her 24th and final Wimbledon Championships the following year. In total Hillyard won 22 titles and, in addition to her Wimbledon successes, won at the Welsh, Irish (three times), and North of England Championships, and between 1885-1905 won the South of England title 11 times. She also enjoyed notable victories abroad including the German Championship in 1897 and 1900, and also won in the South of France and Monaco. Hillyard entered the singles at the 1908 Olympics and, after receiving a bye in the first round, scratched from her quarter-final against the eventual silver medallist Dora Boothby. The 44-year-old Hillyard was conceding 18 years to her opponent. Blanche Hillyard was one of four daughters of a wealthy London tailoring business proprietor, Charles Bentley Bingley. Such was the standing of the Bingley family, who lived in a fashionable London area, that they employed eight servants at their Portland Pace home in the 1880s. When she won her third Wimbledon title in 1894, Hillyard made history as the first mother to win a Wimbledon singles title. As at 2021 this had only happened on three more occasions. Hillyard had given birth to her son Jack in 1891, and he went on to become a good tennis player. He competed at Wimbledon in the 1920s, and in 1924 reached the final of the All England Plate before losing in straight sets to the South African Jack Condon Because of her popularity and fame, Hillyard was asked to contribute articles to such notable publications of the day as Herbert W.W. Wilberforce’s “Lawn Tennis” and Lady Greville’s edition of “The Gentlewoman’s Book of Sports”. When she lived at her Leicestershire home, which contained a tennis court and golf course, she regularly rode with the famous Quorn Hunt.

Although his time was not counted towards the team total he was part of England’s silver medal winning squad. Arguably the best years of his career were lost to World War One where Davey served with the newly formed Royal Naval Air Service in the Orkney Islands. He returned to competition after the war and narrowly missed selection; he was named first reserve, for the 1920 Games in Antwerp. Selected for the British team for the inaugural World Amateur Road Race in 1921 he finished five minutes behind race winner Gunnar Sköld but his time was good enough to take the bronze medal. Davey equalled this feat the following year on home soil when British riders finished in the first three positions. In 1923 at the advanced age of 36 he signed a contract to ride professionally for the New Hudson Bicycle Company. He competed in the prestigious Bol d’Or race in Paris and set a number of long distance place-to-place records in his home country.

An image of his submitted painting Zonnespel could not be traced. But there is a contemporary description, which also laments the distance to sports of many pictures: “The painter Kleintjes sent a naked nymph to a brook in the forest. At first glance, it will not become clear to everyone what sport the dear child is doing: The creek is unfit for swimming; but since the picture was intended for the exhibition of the Games, the painter called it Game of the Sun.”",

Despite her slight build and short stature (48-50 kg, 1.63m), in comparison to her East German and American rivals, Calligaris stood out for her excellent technique (learned from her coaches Bubi Dennerlein and Gianni Gross) and her determination and gritty character in and out of the pool, especially with the press. A distance freestyler, Calligaris was the first Italian to win a swimming Olympic medal. After competing at the 1968 Olympic Games in Mexico City, she set the European record in the 800 metre freestyle (9:38.0) in 1969, then went on to capture a bronze medal at the 1970 European Championships. In 1971, she reset the continental record three times over the same distance, also improving those of the 400 metre and 1500 metre freestyles. At the 1972 Olympic Games in München, Calligaris won the silver behind the Australian star Shane Gould, and set a European record of 4:22.44 in the 400 freestyle. The next day she competed in the 400 IM, breaking the national record in the heats and setting another European record for the bronze. In the 800 freestyle final, Calligaris had a commanding lead only to be beaten by American Keena Rothhammer and Gould, but won the bronze medal with another European record of 8:57.46. She had become a national star, leaving München with three Olympic medals. In the first edition of the FINA World Championships at Belgrade in 1973, and despite a toothache, Calligaris reached the pinnacle of her swimming career, winning the 800 freestyle in 8:52.97 which bettered the world record by 0.7 seconds. Calligaris also won bronzes in the 400 free and 400 IM. Due to a series of circumstances, Calligaris never won a title at the European Championships. In 1974 in Wien (Vienna) she ended her competitive swimming career at just 20 years of age with a silver in the 800 free and a bronze in 400 free. Her palmarès include 76 Italian titles and 21 European records. After her sports career, in 1975 Calligaris started working with the most important Italian newspapers including Corriere della Sera. In 1976 she worked with RAI, Italy’s public television, as a journalist; notably she covered major sporting events and various sections of culture and sports policy with RaiNews24. In the 1990’s, Calligaris embarked on a career in integrated communications and international marketing for large Italian and foreign companies. In 1986, Calligaris entered the International Swimming Hall of Fame, the first Italian swimmer (man or woman) along with Mario Majoni (waterpolo) and Klaus Dibiasi (diving).
