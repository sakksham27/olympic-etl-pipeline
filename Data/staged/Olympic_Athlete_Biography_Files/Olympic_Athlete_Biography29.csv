Her final year in the singles category was 1998, when she placed 6th. She then joined with her future husband David Pelletier, whom she had tried out with once previously in 1996, and together they placed 2nd at the 1999 Canadian Championships, but pulled out of the World Championships due to Pelletier’s back pain. Salé and Pelletier came back in full force in 2000, winning the Canadian Championships with a record five perfect scores from the judges, and coming in 4th at the World Championships. The following year they added a second Canadian Championship victory and a World Championship title to their triumphs and jointly earned the Lou Marsh Trophy, given annually to Canada’s top athlete. In preparation for the 2002 Winter Olympics, the duo took another Canadian Championship that year, but they knew that they would have stiff competition against Russians Yelena Berezhnaya and Anton Sikharulidze. Although the Canadians put on a flawless routine, the judges voted 5-4 in favor of the Russians and Salé and Pelletier won silver. A few days later it was revealed that a French judge that had voted for the Russians had been pressured into her decision in exchange for Russian judges favoring the French ice dance team. A decision was made to award both duos the gold medal in the tournament.

Prior to snagging the silver in the women’s event at the 2000 World Championships she ran track and played basketball at the provincial level. Nevertheless,her road to Olympic success was a rocky one: she nearly quit the sport after being denied the opportunity to compete for Team Canada at the 2002 Winter Olympics a mere three weeks before the opening ceremony. Yet, by the end of the 2005-06 season of the skeleton World Cup, she had claimed the woman’s overall title at the Skeleton World Cup and at the 2006 Winter Olympics she captured the bronze medal in the women’s skeleton event. She was considered a medal favorite in the women’s event at the 2010 Winter Olympics, but a terrible final left her in fifth place at the end of the tournament. She was so distraught at her final position that she apologized to the Canadian public for her result. In her spare time, Hollingsworth works with Right to Play and has donated time and money to the organization’s efforts in Ghana.","Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the World Bob & Skeleton Championships (FIBT/IBSF) (0–2–3 2000 Igls silver: Skeleton (competed as Mellisa Hollingsworth); 2011 Königssee bronze: Skeleton and BOB/SKE Mixed team (competed as Mellisa Hollingsworth); 2012 Lake Placid silver: Skeleton, bronze: BOB/SKE Mixed team (competed as Mellisa Hollingsworth))"

Van Schelle represented Belgium at four Olympic Games during the 1920s and 1930s. He was executed by the Nazis during World War II. Van Schelle was born in Belgium in 1899 and spent the early part of his life in the United States. Van Schelle lived in Chicago from 1904 to 1918. During this time Van Schelle’s mother was onboard the RMS Lusitania when it was torpedoed by a German U-boat. Although she survived the sinking, she later died of her injuries. As a result, Van Schelle joined the American Expeditionary Force and landed in France in 1918. At the end of World War I, Van Schelle returned to live in Belgium. During the 1920s Van Schelle excelled as a swimmer. Van Schelle was the Belgian champion in the 100 metres freestyle in 1920–23 and 1925–28, and in the 200 metres freestyle in 1922–23. Van Schelle competed at three editions of the Summer Olympics; 1920 Antwerpen, 1924 Paris, and 1928 Amsterdam. However, Van Schelle’s national success did not translate to international success, as he did not progress from the heats in the races he swam in. Van Schelle’s next Olympic appearance would as a bobsledder at the 1936 Garmisch-Partenkirchen Games. In the four-man bobsleigh the Belgian #2 team finished in fifth place. Van Schelle also competed with Max Houben in the two-man bobsleigh. The pair finished in ninth place. As a businessman Van Schelle owned a sports goods store in Bruxelles. In 1935 this earned him an American patent for a tennis racket. Whilst in the city Van Schelle also owned two ice rinks. Van Schelle helped with the construction of more ice rinks in Belgium, bringing back speed skating, and arranging ice hockey tournaments. During World War II Van Schelle was active in espionage against the Germans. In January 1943 Van Schelle was arrested by the Nazis.

In 1908 he participated in the trials for what would become Canada’s first truly national lacrosse delegation and was selected to travel with them to the 1908 Summer Olympics. After a schedule change, the squad ended up arriving six weeks early and Hamilton joined some of his teammates in visiting Ireland, prior to defeating the British team, their only opponents, 14-10 and securing a gold medal. After the Olympic tournament, several of the Canadians retired from active play, but Hamilton was the first to re-engage in active competition in May of 1909, despite being elected as the president of the Montreal Hockey Club in April, another sport at which he excelled. By June, however, his intentions had vacillated and he dropped out of both rugby and lacrosse by the end of the month. Three years later, in May of 1912, Hamilton was elected president of the Montreal Lacrosse Team. When the National Lacrosse Union voted to reinstate the role of the field captain later that month, he took on that position as well, in addition to his coaching duties. In November 1913 he stepped down as president, intending to leave the sport forever, but he was again drawn back into the club and immediately elected vice-president. In the 1930s he was one of the trustees for the lacrosse MVP cup in the International Professional League and remained a figure in the sport into the 1940s. In 1933 he helped organize the Royal Montreal Hockey Club whose senior division won the Allan Cup, given annually to the senior men’s ice hockey champions in Canada, in 1939 and 1947.

An officer in the Royal Artillery, he won the AAA 440 yards title in 1931 and then made his mark on the international scene in the England vs. Germany match in Cologne later in the season, when after running 47.0 in the 4x400 metre relay, he covered the 400 metres stage of the medley relay in 46.7. The following season saw him win a silver medal in the relay at the Los Angeles Olympics when the British team set a European record of 3:11.6 behind the USA. In 1934, Rampling had his second win at the AAA Championships and then took the British Empire title with a British record of 48.0. He also finished first in the 1934 British Empire Games 4×440 yards relay (with Crew Stoneley and the non-Olympians Denis Rathbone and Geoffrey Blake). Although he was in fine form at the 1936 Games, he narrowly missed making the final of the individual 400 metres; but he made amends for this disappointment with a marvelous run in the relay. Running the second leg, Rampling took over the baton 12 metres behind the leader, but with a 46.7 run he handed over with a three-metre advantage and Britain went on to take the gold medals in 3:09.0. In doing so, as in 1932, they set a European record. Rampling retired from the Army as a lieutenant colonel and was, for a time, the secretary of a golf club. His daughter, Charlotte, became a well-known film actress.

He then moved to the longer rifle ranges, and enjoyed even more success, winning the Match Rifle Championship for the Hopton Cup in 1911, 1919, and 1930. In 1931 he set a British Isles record, and what was also believed to be a world record at the time, of hitting 35 consecutive bulls from 1,100 yards. Blood represented Ireland in many top team competitions, including the McKinnon Match five times in 1908-10 and 1913-14. He also made 26 consecutive appearances for Ireland in the annual international Elcho Shield match between 1904-29, and was captain for three years from 1931. Blood retired from competitive shooting at the end of the 1934 Bisley Meeting having won nearly 100 match rifle prizes at Bisley, including four in succession in 1911. An outstanding mathematician, Blood was originally a schoolmaster before becoming a stockbroker, and he represented the Stock Exchange Rifle Club in competitive shooting matches.",

A British and two-time European lightweight champion, Nash had to identify his brother’s body after he was shot in the back by the Parachute Regiment while running for cover during a civil rights march on the streets of Derry. Nash chose to return to the gym two weeks later. He later stated, “Had there been no Olympic Games that year, I would’ve probably ended up in the IRA. Boxing saved my life.” After the München Olympics, Nash turned professional. He débuted in October 1975 against Ray Ross, winning on points. He won the EBU lightweight title in June 1979, defeating André Holyk on points. In March 1980 he fought Jim Watt for the World Boxing Council lightweight crown but lost by TKO. He lost his EBU title in May 1981 when he was knocked out by Giuseppe Gibilisco and would lose three of his final five bouts before retiring. He would fight as a pro until a TKO loss in March 1983 against René Weller, compiling a professional record of 25 wins (9 by KO) and 5 losses. Nash became a boxing coach at St. Mary’s ABC, working with young fighters. One of 12 children, Charlie Nash considered William his best friend. His death led Charlie to years of depression, although he only felt the effects after hanging up his gloves. He credited his wife, Betty, with keeping him going through the darkest days.",

Both studied from 1912 at the École National des Arts Décoratifs in Paris and worked as sculptors, designers and interior designers. They applied new or rarely used materials in sculpture and often collaborated with architects such as Robert Mallet-Stevens. In 1929, they were among the founding members of the Union des Artistes Modernes, and were both best-known for their ornamental sculptures, statues, monuments and fountains displaying characteristics typical of the Art Déco and Cubist periods, which included a monument to the great French composer and musician Claude Debussy. Their avant-garde sculptures for their four concrete Cubist (trees) designed for a garden setting at the 1925 Exposition des Arts Décoratifs et Industriels Modernes in Paris became especially well-known. Both were closely tied to their native region, the Vendée, and died in 1966, about six months apart from one another, Jan in an accident and Joël as the result of a long struggling illness. The brothers usually did not individually sign their works, so the separate assignment in the 1948 art catalog may not be correct. The Polo Player, a 60 cm high and long sculpture, dates back to 1930. The first version is still missing the quarter disks, which can be seen on a picture dated 1934.

Even though he was already listed for the Chinese squad at the 1925 Far Eastern Games, he was still playing in the Third Division. During the 1929-30 season, he was finally installed in the First Division team. Subsequently he mostly played in the midfield, but also spent time as an inside-right. In 1934 Huang played in the Far Eastern Games. Shortly after his participation in the Olympics he was suspended for one year because of a serious foul. Huang’s only known later appearance was in 1938 as inside-right against a visiting English team. Afterwards, he mysteriously disappeared. Rumors say that he might have been captured or killed by the Japanese. There is no information about his fate, however, even though his family still lives in Hong Kong. The most likely scenario is that he was brought to the island of Hainan by the Japanese and died there.

She was born in Kyiv but moved to Britain at the age of 2 when her father signed to play for Ipswich Town. Baltacha grew up in Perth, Scotland after her father joined St. Johnstone and considered herself Scottish. She reached the top of the British rankings as a junior and reached the third round of Wimbledon at the age of eighteen in 2002. After reaching the number one spot in the senior British rankings, her career stalled in 2003 due to illness and she underwent surgery. This determined that she had Primary sclerosing cholangitis, a disease of the liver, and she received treatment for the rest of the life. By 2006 she was on the verge of breaking into the top 100 rankings when a prolapsed disc again meant that her career was interrupted again. The best period of her career came between 2009 and 2011 where she rose to a best ever position of 49th in the WTA world rankings and won her greatest tournament victory namely the Aegon Nottingham Challenge in 2011. Baltacha was also a fixture in the British Fed Cup team between 2002 and 2013. She failed to recover from a knee injury and retired from the sport at the end of 2013. In December 2013 Baltacha married her coach, Nino Severino, but their happiness was short-lived as she was diagnosed with an aggressive form of liver cancer just a few weeks later. After battling the disease for 5 months she passed away in May 2014. Known as a feisty competitor on the court, she served as patron of the Children’s Liver Disease Foundation for the last few years of her life. To mark the first anniversary of her death, in May 2015, the LTA announced that the winner of the Aegon Open at Nottingham would receive the “Elena Baltacha Trophy”. It was the first time the LTA had named one of its major trophies after a current or former player. It was at Nottingham that Baltacha won the last of her 11 ITF Pro-Circuit titles in 2013.",Daughter of Sergey Baltacha

He was part of the relay squad for the 1992 Games but did not skate in the semi-final as the Aussies crashed out of the event. Considered a medal contender in the individual events at Lillehammer he was hampered by crashing rivals in both events and did not reach a final although he was part of the Australian relay team that skated to their nation’s first ever Winter Games medal. Their Olympic bronze was matched at that year’s World Championships. In 1995 Bradbury was involved in an accident at a meeting in Montreal where his thigh was slashed by another skater’s blade. He lost a large amount of blood as the blade sliced his quadricep muscles and required over a hundred stitches to the leg. Having recovered from the injury he regained his form and entered the 1998 Olympic Games with medal ambitions but failed to make it out of the heats. He broke two vertebra in his neck in a training accident in late 2000 and missed the 2000-01 season but returned the next season with the intention of competing at one last Winter Games. The events of Salt Lake City are the stuff of Australian legend. Bradbury, by then considered in the twilight of his career, qualified simply enough from his heat but finished third in the quarter-final and would have been eliminated if Marc Gagnon of Canada had not been disqualified. In his semi-final he was in a poor position and due for elimination but a collision between skaters from Korea and Japan gave him the opportunity to win the race. What had taken place in the heats, unlikely as it was, paled in comparison with the final. In a five man final Bradbury was tailed off in last position throughout the race as the other four battled for the title. As they approached the last turn Li Jiajun and Apolo Anton Ohno clashed and in the resulting melee all four men found themselves sliding out of control towards the barriers. By the time Bradbury arrived the path was clear and he crossed the line to win the gold medal before anybody else could react. Bradbury also competed in three other events in Salt Lake City and reached the B final in the 1500m. He retired after the Games and began a career as a motivational speaker and worked for Australian television as a commentator for the 2006 Winter Olympics. Bradbury published his autobiography aptly titled “Last Man Standing” in 2005 and since his success the phrase “Doing a Bradbury” has entered Australian vocabulary as the epitome of an unlikely success against all odds.",Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the World Short Track Speed Skating Championships (1–1–1 1991 Sydney gold: 5000 m relay; 1993 Beijing bronze: 5000 m relay; 1994 Guildford silver: 5000 m relay)

921390,Jan Kapr,Male,12 March 1914,,, Czechoslovakia,TCH,"Czechoslovak composer Jan Kapr suffered a severe injury during his youth, which prevented him from playing an instrument himself. Nevertheless, he graduated from the Praha Conservatory from Jaroslav Křička’s master class. He was music editor at Radio Praha until the end of World War II. After that, he was promoted to chief editor of a national music publisher and professor for compositions in Brno. His focus was on composing, including political mass songs. As a loyal member of the Communist Party he received the Stalin Award in 1951. However, he returned the award, protesting against the 1968 Soviet Occupation. Consequently, his works were not allowed to be performed in Czechoslovakia and his 8th Symphony, for instance, premiered on Bavarian radio. Jan Kapr was one of the few artists who was actively engaged in sports, particularly gymnastics. But the injury that he received during an exercise inhibited a sports career. Kapr was an author of 10 symphonies. In the 1960s he became interested in avant-garde composition techniques, and started to investigate the articulating possibilities of the human voice on various instruments, combining electronic and acoustic sounds. His work Marathon Scherzo (in most sources called Marathon: scherzo symphonique), one of his earlier works composed in 1939, received an “Honorable Mention” in 1948. The length of the work is almost 13-minutes. It was first performed on the radio in March 1940 under Bohemian composer and conductor Otakar Jeremiáš. The composition, which contains a lot of 12-tone sequences, was compared with the neo-Classicism of Paul Hindemith. The story underlying the work has been interpreted as the legend of the ancient marathon runner: with the initial wartime rhythm, the rhythmical section of the messenger running, and a festive fanfare, illustrating the arrival of the message of victory in Athina. The following silence reminds one of the messenger’s death, while another rhythmic “run” links the history to the modern athlete, and the final fanfare hails the winner at the finish. In the late 1950s, Kapr composed his 5th symphony with the subtitle Olympic. The titles of the movements show a similar programmatic scheme: I. The Honor of the Winner; II. Light of the Ages; III. Youth; IV. Calling the Nation.",

His grandfather Pasquale (1812-87) was also a sculptor. After World War II, Romano became known for the creation of the Friezes in South Africa for the Voortrekker Monument, which he did with local artists. Raffaello, one of his sons, also became a sculptor. As early as 1928, he created a memorial for the South African General Botha. As a navigator, Romano Romanelli traveled around the world with the Italian Navy (he studied at the Navy School), visiting the Mediterranean, North America, and Europe including the Azores and Madeira. He served as a Navy officer in various wars until World War I, including in China, Japan, Siberia, the Dutch and British East Indies, the Indian Ocean, and the Red Sea. It was not until 1909 that he turned entirely to art. His style combined the classicist style of Italy with the influences of French modernism. From 1942 he was professor of sculpture at the art academy in Firenze. Romanelli created both large scale works and smaller statues. He worked for the Fascist state as well as for Catholic churches. Romanelli modeled two boxer statues within a few years: The Wounded Boxer (Il Pugile Ferito) was created around 1930 and is the better known version today. Based on the information in the exhibition catalog from 1936, the submitted work Pugile (Boxer) was created in 1925. Therefore, the entered work is more likely to be the Fighting Boxer (Pugile in Combattimento), which the Italian state has bought for the Foro Italico in Roma and which was shown in the Mostra del Novecento in 1929. Only a plaster version has survived in the Galleria Romanelli. The bronze version was created at the latest in 1928 for the Opera Nazionale Dopolavoro (OND), a fascist leisure and recreation organization for adults.",

After a season with the Western Hockey League’s Regina Pats, he was scouted by the Washington Capitals of the National Hockey League, but his professional career would not materialize until 1987, when he began suiting up with the Minnesota North Stars, and he nearly quit the sport in 1986. In the meantime he played for the Fort Wayne Komets of the International Hockey League (1982-1986, and was the league’s points leader in 1984), the Canadian national team (1986-1988), and Wiener EV of Austria (1987-1988). At the 1988 Winter Olympics he played in eight games and scored one goal for Canada, who placed fourth. He stayed with the North Stars for the 1988-1989 season, but also played for the Komets and Kalamazoo Wings. Beginning in 1989 Schreiber would spend the remainder of hockey career, which lasted until 2000, between the Canadian national team and squads in the German league. The International Ice Hockey Federation had first allowed professionals to compete at the Olympics in 1988 (although no NHL teams granted their players the time off to attend) and this paid off for the Canadians in 1992 and 1994 when they won silver medals at the Olympic tournaments. In the first, Schreiber had two goals in eight games and, in the second, he managed one goal in just as many matches. He was also a member of Team Canada when they won a bronze medal at the 1995 World Championships.

96353,Jan Pesman,Male,4 May 1931,182.0,71, Netherlands,NED,"A long distance specialist, Jan Pesman had started competitive skating only in his twenties. Competing in all major international events between 1957 and 1960, Pesman’s results gradually improved. His first victory came in 1959, when he won the 5000 m at the World Allround Championships, placing second in the 10k. The following season, at the World Championships, he won the 10000 m. Just two weeks before the start of the Olympics, this propelled him into a role as favourite for the long distances. After Pesman delivered a 5k test race result only narrowly slower than the World Record, he considered himself a gold medal hope. Skating against Viktor Kosichkin, he was beaten by 14 seconds, which was still enough for the bronze medal. Pesman then failed to do well in the longest distance, falling back after a blistering opening pace that was faster than that of winner and new World Record holder Knut Johannesen. He retired after that race. Personal Bests: 500 – 43.4 (1960); 1500 – 2:11.0 (1960); 5000 – 7:46.7 (1960); 10000 – 16:41.0 (1960).",
8671,Joe Frazier,Male,12 January 1944,183.0,89, United States,USA,"Joe Frazier had no business winning a gold medal in the 1964 Olympics. He had been beaten in the Olympic trials by Buster Mathis, a fighter with a far better amateur record. But Mathis broke his thumb while training for the Olympics and Frazier got his chance. It was ironic because in the Olympic semi-finals, Joe Frazier broke his own thumb. But “Smokin’ Joe” Frazier was not a man to be denied. He had the thumb taped, basically fought with one hand in the finals and won the gold medal. It was typical of this gutsy fighter. Joe Frazier was one of the great heavyweight champions of all time. It is sad that he fought in the same era as Muhammad Ali because he did not get the acclaim Ali did, and it was acclaim Frazier deserved. Frazier first won the heavyweight world championship in 1970 by stopping Jimmy Ellis in five rounds. He defended the title several times before being knocked out by former Olympian George Foreman. Frazier fought three tremendous battles with Ali. The first, in 1971, was the Fight of the Century, a battle of undefeated heavyweight champions, and Frazier won by a decision in 15. Frazier was on the losing end in the next two fights, but all three were great, great spectacles. The final match-up, the Thrilla in Manila, is usually acclaimed as the greatest ever heavyweight fight, with both fighters so exhausted by their efforts that Frazier was not allowed by his managers to come out for round 15, not knowing that Ali was about to do the same thing. Frazier was very short for a heavyweight, and he made no pretense of backpedaling. He always came at you like a Sherman tank, willing to trade three punches to land one pulverizing blow. After losing his heavyweight title, he continued to fight for a few years before retiring in the mid 70s, except for a brief comeback in 1981. He sang with a group called “The Knockouts” and made some television commercials. His son, Marvis Frazier, also boxed professionally, twice fighting for the heavyweight title, but without success. Despite the acclaim accorded Muhammad Ali, which somewhat diminished Frazier’s appeal, his opponent knew of his greatness, describing him as follows, “Fighting Joe Frazier is the closest thing to death that I know of. Of all the men I fought in boxing, including Sonny Liston and George Foreman, the roughest and toughest was Joe Frazier. … If God ever calls me to a Holy War, I want Joe Frazier fighting beside me.”",Listed in Olympic Boxers Who Won a Professional World Championship (Olympics - 1964 Super-heavyweight (Gold); Professional World Champion - WBC Heavyweight (1968-1970); Undisputed Heavyweight (1970-1973).)

Throughout the following decade he won numerous individual and team gold medals in international competitions, mainly at official and unofficial Pan Arab Games. He also competed in the Morocco Cycle Tour five times and was the national champion thrice (1982, 1983, and 1985). Among his notable non-medaling placements were fourth in the individual road race at the 1983 Mediterranean Games (held in his native country) and a non-finishing appearance in the same event at the 1984 Summer Olympics. Shortly afterwards he made the decision to turn professional, but abandoned this pursuit when his university refused to allow him the necessary time off to train and compete. After his career as a competitor ended, Ben Bouilla spent three years in the United Arab Emirates as a coach and a trainer, but resigned after not being properly compensated for his successful efforts. Despite his success as a sportsman, he found himself marginalized in his home country throughout his life and, on more than one occasion, nearly quit the national team. He was encouraged by his friend, the renowned Moroccan cyclist Mustapha Nejjari, to persevere but, after retiring, his troubles increased and he found it difficult to support his family of three children. He appealed to Moroccan Olympic Champion Nawal El-Moutawakel, but never received a reply, and the Governor of the Marrakech region gave him only a job as a street cleaner, an offering that so shamed the Regional Director that he provided Ben Bouilla four months’ salary without having to work. As of 2009 he runs a bicycle repair shop, but continues to face daily economic hardship and the rupture of his family.",

He then went up to Corpus Christi, Cambridge, but had a poor domestic season prior to the 1912 Olympic Games. He lost to Duncan Macmillan in the 100 yards at the Cambridge University sports and in the match against Oxford, and at the AAA Championships he finished last in his 100 yards heat and did not run in the 220 yards. In Stockholm, he was eliminated in the heats of both sprints and 1912 would have been a very lean year had it not been for his Olympic gold medal in the sprint relay. In 1913, Macintosh was President of the Cambridge University AC and won the 100 yards against Oxford. His vastly improved form continued when he won the Scottish 100 yards title before equaling the British record of 9.8 seconds in Vienna. In 1914, he again won the 100 yards against Oxford before leaving to serve as an Assistant District Commission in South Africa after obtaining his B.A. from Cambridge in June that same year. After only a few months, the outbreak of war brought him home and he was commissioned into the 8th battalion, Argyll & Sutherland Highlanders. In the summer of 1918, Captain Macintosh was killed in action during the Second Battle of the Somme. Macintosh was also a fine rugby wing three-quarter, and played for the Cambridge XV. At the time of his death, his two brothers were both prisoners-of-war in Germany.

For the Reichssportfeld in Berlin he designed the building ceramics in 1935-36. His hometown of Lörrach awarded him honorary citizenship in 1939. In 1944 Laeuger was awarded the Goethe Medal for Art and Science, one of the highest artistic awards of Nazi Germany. The “Grand Prix” at the Triennial of Milan in 1951 once again clearly showed the international significance of his ceramic creations. In 1928, Laeuger won the bronze medal for his Design For Town Planning Entwurf zum Stadtpark Hamburg 1908 (Design of town park for Hamburg in 1908). It had been created for a competition that the city had advertised. The Hamburg municipal park was opened in 1914, but no competition design was implemented unchanged. The final plan came from Hamburg’s building director Fritz Schumacher, who, however, was strongly geared to Laeuger’s design. Responsible for the horticultural facilities was Otto Linne, another Olympian. In the same year 1928, Laeuger also submitted a majolica (tin-glazed pottery) with the title Women on Horseback (also called Two Amazons on Horses).

He joined the national team five years later and made his debut at the 1973 World Championships. His first major international medals came a year later, at the Commonwealth Games, when he won gold as a member of the 4×100 metre medley relay, alongside Bill Mahony, Brian Phillips, and Bruce Robertson, and silver in the 100 metre backstroke, behind Mark Tonelli of Australia. He attended the 1975 World Championships and, by the time of the 1976 Summer Olympics, had set three national and two Commonwealth records. At the Games he captured silver in the 4×100 m medley relay with Robertson, Clay Evans, Gary MacDonald, and Graham Smith. One day prior, however, he had caused the Canadians (Steve Badger, James Hett, and Bill Sawchuk) to be disqualified from the 4×200 m freestyle relay due to a false start. He was also eliminated in the semifinals of the 100 m backstroke, butterfly, and freestyle events. Pickell entered the University of Southern California on an athletic scholarship after the Games, but continued to compete internationally for Canada. He missed the 1978 Commonwealth Games due to a shoulder injury sustained while playing water polo for USC, but did make it to the 1979 Pan American Games, where he took silver in the 4×100 m medley relay (alongside Sawchuk, Smith, and the non-Olympian Dan Thompson) and bronze in the 100 m backstroke. He was selected to represent his nation again at the 1980 Summer Olympics, but stayed home when Canada joined the boycott of those Games. Nagging injuries caused him to retire soon after and, since his graduation from USC, he has worked in insurance and coached at the high school and club levels.","Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the Summer Pan American Games (0–1–1 1979 San Juan SWI silver: 4×100 m medley relay, bronze: 100 m backstroke) Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the British Empire/Commonwealth Games (1–1–0 1974 Christchurch SWI gold: 4×100 m medley, silver: 100 m backstroke)"

He also contracted a serious hip infection and his parents were advised that he might not live into his teens. Johnson recovered from his illness and, at the age of six, went through a series of operations that for the first time gave him complete mobility in his hips and legs. A year later he decided to test himself by entering the Sheffield Star Walk, a local 12 mile race, despite having no experience of race walking. He finished last but twelve months later, after a year of hard training, finished on the podium. In 1954 he finished 2nd behind John Ljunggren in the National 50 km walk championships and was chosen for the European Championships in Bern. His major championship debut ended in disappointment, however, when he was forced to retire suffering from dehydration. After two successful years he was chosen for the 1956 Olympic Games in the 50 km walk and after struggling to cope with the heat mid-race rallied to finish respectable 8th. His next appearance at the Olympic Games was the biggest disappointment of his career. Whilst contesting the lead with the eventual winner of the 1960 50 km walk, Don Thompson, he was given his third warning for lifting and disqualified from the race. In 1963 he took a job as a psychiatric nurse at a hospital on the Isle of Man and went on to compete for the island at the 1966 British Empire and Commonwealth Games in Jamaica.

In addition, he has won two World distance titles (both in 1997) and six Olympic medals between 1994 and 2006. He broke the World Record in the 1500 m twice, becoming both the first man to go faster than 1:52 and 1:49. In 1996, Ritsma caused a revolution in Dutch speed skating by starting the first professional skating team. His move caused a shift in skating, with all Dutch skaters now being employed by commercial teams rather than the national federation. Ritsma’s career was often thought to have come to an end, for example when he missed qualification for the 2001 World Championships. When illness of a team mate allowed him to compete after all, he took first place - his last international title. He also surprised critics by qualifying for the 2002 and 2006 Olympics, winning a team pursuit bronze in Torino. He finally did announce his retirement in September 2008.

From 1919 onwards he was continuously awarded prizes at the Emperor Exhibitions. In 1928, he was one of the founding members of a group of oppositional sculptors called kōzō-sha aimed at combining sculpture and architecture. Hinago travelled to Europe in 1929 and spent two years in France and Italy. After his return he was active in re-organizing the Imperial Art Institute and became a member of the board of the Kokufu sculpture association. Hinako created over 200 sculptures, including a commemorative medal on Yabusame (archery from horseback, a Japanese national sport) for the 1936 Berlin Olympics. Hinako also created the Japanese Soccer Association’s symbol of a three-legged crow. Probably his best known works were reliefs for the hakkō ichiu tower in Miyazaki, constructed in 1940. After World War II, the tower was renamed Heiwanotou Tower (Tower of Peace). Hinago was commissioned to make commemorative medals for many sports-related events, and also for military events. Rugby is a 15 x 40 x 10 cm bronze sculpture from 1932. It was awarded as a trophy in international matches between Japan and Canada. Yabusame is a bronze plaque from 1935 in the format 72 x 80 x 12 mm. The Priest plaque from 1936 is likely to have a similar format.",

He was born under the name Buchta (his mother’s name), then he called himself Charous (maiden name of his mother) and took the stage name “Charoux” (the caricatured name was from “Chat Roux”) after his marriage to Margaret Treibl in 1926. From 1924-28 he worked as a cartoonist for the Arbeiter-Zeitung under that pseudonym. In World War I, his right hand was injured, but healed completely after surgery. He first attended acting school, then studied sculpture in Vienna. As a politically left-leaning artist, he had to immigrate to London in 1935. In 1946 he was naturalized. Stylistically, his work is attributable to expressionism, which also applied to his painting. In 1978, the Charoux museum was opened in Langenzersdorf (Austria).

His top-10 World Cup début was an inauspicious 10th place in a downhill event in January 1970, but just over a month later he was the World Champion in the event. Leading up to the 1972 Winter Olympics Russi won four World Cup events (including the giant slalom once) and the 1971 downhill title and entered the Games as the favourite. He did not disappoint, capturing the gold medal ahead of his compatriot Roland Collombin. Russi then won an additional three World Cup events, and the 1972 downhill title, but was unable to defend his World Championship crown and finished 13th overall. Nonetheless he entered the 1976 Winter Olympics and nearly defended his title, being defeated by Austria’s Franz Klammer by only 0.33 seconds. Russi won one more World Cup event in 1977 and retired in early 1978 with a total of 27 podium finishes, all but one of which were in the downhill. Russi was downhill World Cup champion in the 1970/71 and 1971/72 seasons. In the overall World Cup his best seasonal finish was fifth, which he did in 1970/71, 1971/72, and 1976/77. Following his exit from active competition he took up course design and has served with the International Ski Federation as the chairman of the alpine committee and a downhill course technical advisor, which has led him to design several courses for the Olympic Games. He also served as a television commentator in his native country.","Listed in Olympians Involved in James Bond movies (Skiied down a bobsled run as a double in ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"") Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the World Alpine Ski Championships (2–1–0 1970 Val Gardena gold: downhill; 1972 Sapporo (Olympics) gold: downhill; 1976 Innsbruck (Olympics) silver: downhill) Listed in Olympic Alpine Skiers - Gold Medalists and World Champions; Same Discipline - Different Event (Downhill: Olympic Gold - 1972; World Champion - 1970)"

Livorno-born Nadi had fencing in his blood. His father Beppe was a well-known fencer in Italy, with his own fencing school. Together with his older brother Nedo Aldo learned to fight the foil and sabre, but not the épée. His father considered épée to be an “undisciplined weapon” and forbade his pupils to use it, although the brothers did so in secrecy and eventually won a gold medal in the team épée in Antwerp. At the 1912 Olympics, he surprisingly won the individual foil title - partially because of a French boycott due to a regulations disagreement. In 1920, he produced one of the greatest of all Olympic performances. He won the individual foil and sabre titles and led the Italians to victory in all three team events, for a record five fencing medals at the same Games. His brother, Aldo, also won a gold medal in each of the three team events. The Nadi brothers were again somewhat aided by the absence of a major fencing nation, as Hungary was barred from entering the 1920 Olympics. Nadi was also lucky in the foil event. He won ten of his eleven final bouts, but lost to Roger Ducret of France. With Ducret only having to beat the last-placed fencer in the pool, he was expected to win the gold, and Nadi withdrew crying. In his euphoria, Ducret failed to concentrate for his last match and was beaten by Pietro Speciale of Italy, leaving first place for Nadi. Nadi also won a gold medal in individual foil at the 1919 Inter-Allied Games. After the Antwerp Games, Nedo Nadi taught as a professional in South America but on his return he was reinstated as an amateur and served as President of the Italian Fencing Federation. Nadi fought in World War I and was decorated by the Italian government for bravery.","Brother of Aldo Nadi Listed in Olympic Fencers - Winning Gold Medals, Épée/Sabre (1920 Épée, Team; 1920 Sabre, Individual; 1920 Sabre, Team.)

Cadbury joined the family business after the 1952 Olympics and was appointed chairman in 1965. He held the post for nearly 25 years and oversaw the famous merger with Schweppes. He was also a director of the Bank of England 1970-94, of computer giants IBM from 1979-94 and was also chancellor of Aston University in his home-town Birmingham from 1979-94. Cadbury retired from the family business at the age of 60 in 1990 and at the request of the Financial Reporting Council, he led an enquiry into how business were run in Britain and following its publication in 1992, the “Cadbury Report” set the standards for how business should be run all over the world. Two of his main observations were in separating the roles of the chairman and chief executive and also maintained that businesses built on trust and teamwork performed better than those who were not. Cadbury was educated at Eton where he learned to row, and following National Service in the Coldstream Guards he read economics at King’s College, Cambridge where he became a rowing Blue in the famous race in 1952 which Oxford won by a canvas, the shortest winning margin since the dead-heat of 1877. Cadbury was then chosen for the British coxless fours at the Helsinki Games when they finished fourth, just two seconds off a medal position. Cadbury described the emotion of the occasion as “The greatest thing that ever happened to me.” He maintained close links with the sport he loved up to the time of his death and was President of the Birmingham Rowing Club for many years. He was a patron of the famous Leander Club, was made a steward at Henley Royal Regatta in 1969, where he was also a timekeeper.

He later turned to boat design and, in the late 50s, designed the International Contender class, which was considered a possible replacement for the Finn dinghy Olympic class. In the early 1960s Miller joined with Craig Whitworth to form Miller & Whitworth Pty Ltd, a boat building firm. They also sailed together, being named Australian Yachtsmen of the Year in 1966-67 for their work in the Flying Dutchman class. Miller won multiple Australian Championships in the Soling, Flying Dutchman, and 18-foot classes. He also competed in the VJ, VS, 16-foot, and Star classes. After the 1972 Olympics, his partnership with Whitworth ended and he started designing boats on his own, but legally changed his name to Benjamin Lexcen in 1977, known as Ben Lexcen, because Whitworth continued to use the name Miller & Whitworth for the company. Miller designed Southern Cross, the Australian challenger for the America’s Cup in 1974, and modified it when it again challenged in 1980. His greatest fame, however, came in 1983 when he helped design Australia II, specifically its controversial winged keel, which enabled Australia II to defeat Dennis Conner’s Liberty to end the United States’ 132-year-old domination of the America’s Cup. Lexcen was promoted to AM and given the Prince Philip Prize for Australian Design. Together with the Australia II’s owner, Alan Bond, and its skipper, John Bertrand, he was named Australian Yachtsman of the Year for 1982-83. Lexcen died relatively young from a heart attack but, in 1988, the University of New South Wales created sports scholarships in his name and, in 2006, he was posthumously named to the America’s Cup Hall of Fame.","Listed in Olympic Sailors and the America's Cup (1972 Soling; 1983 America's Cup, designed Australia II winged keel (as Ben Lexcen) that helped yacht win America's Cup after 132 year domination by USA.

921017,Kosaku Yamada,Male,9 June 1886,,, Japan,JPN,"When Kosaku Yamada was only 10-years-old, his father died. According to his father’s wishes, Kosaku attended a Christian missionary school. He later went to live with his sister, who was married to an Englishman, Edward Gauntlet. They allowed him to pursue his higher education and Gauntlet, an amateur musician and an organist for the Anglican Church, fostered his interest in Western music and in 1904 Yamada entered the Tokyo Music School. Because that School did not have a composing department at that time, Yamada studied singing and later cello and theory under two German teachers, August Junker and Heinrich Werkmeister. Yamada wrote string quartets, instrumental pieces, songs and chorals. In 1910, he moved to Berlin to continue his studies at the conservatory guided by famous composers like Max Bruch and Leopold Wolf, where he wrote a symphony and an opera, both the first attempts ever by a Japanese composer. When Yamada was on a visit to Japan, he was forced to stay there due to the outbreak of World War I. Reluctantly he gave up his plans for Europe and in 1914 founded his own orchestra, because there was no symphony orchestra in Japan at that time. In 1918 his works were performed for the first time at Carnegie Hall, New York, where he conducted the New York Symphony Orchestra. During his time in the United States, he met the Russian composers Rachmaninov and Prokofiev. In 1921, one of his most important works, the Inno Meiji symphony, was completed, combining traditional Japanese instruments as solo instruments backed by a symphony orchestra. In the 1930s, he continued to conduct, including the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra, and wrote a wide variety of musical pieces including scores for the first Japanese movies with sound. Yamada then worked as a musical teacher, numbering among his students Wenye Jiang and Noboru Ito. He later concentrated on musical theatre, but his magnum opus, called The Princess Shian-Fei, based on a Chinese story, was left uncompleted when Japan was defeated in World War II. It was finished much later and was not staged until 1981. In 1942 Yamada was appointed a member of the Imperial Academy of Arts and two years later he became president of the Japanese Music Cultural Association. His activities during the war, such as appearing in uniform and being given a general’s treatment, were later considered quite controversial and some thought he should be considered a war criminal. After suffering a stroke in 1948, Yamada became disabled and was only able to write songs. In 1956, he was awarded the Order of Cultural Merit, and at the age of 79 he died in his home in Tokyo from a heart attack. Kosaku Yamada was a leading figure in bringing Western music to Japan and by performing in New York, Berlin and other places of the Western World he was also the first Japanese composer to become known in Europe and North America. His life was later dramatized for television. His entry in the 1936 art competitions in 1936 is listed in the catalog simply as Kōshinkyoku (March).

Between 1922 and 1936 he competed for IFK Hedemora. He took part in a race in Borlänge, “Dalarna’s Holmenkollen”, in 1932 when he defeated Olympic gold medalist Per-Erik Hedlund. Matsbo won his first major race in 1934, the Swedish Championship in the 15 km. At the 1936 Winter Olympics in Garmisch-Partenkirchen Matsbo won a bronze medal in the relay, and he earned two more relay bronze medals at the Nordic World Ski Championships in 1935 and 1938. His best individual finish at the Nordic Skiing World Championships was a fourth in the 18 km in 1938. Matsbo also won the 18 km event at the 1937 Holmenkollen ski festival. In the same year he was recruited by Hudiksvall IF to win the Swedish Championship the same year, both individually in the 15 km and in the relay. Later, he competed for Malungs IF and with them won a national championship in the relay in 1942. With his club team he took another Swedish Championship and was runner-up in the 15 km in 1939. In 1941 Matsbo, who was a non-commissioned officer, participated in the War World Championships in Cortina d’Ampezzo, competing amongst others against three teams of Alpine Hunters. Except for his athletic performance, Matsbo had made himself a name for his improvements in waxing technology. He was famous for his own ski wax, one of the most used in the 1940s and 1950s. In 1942 his wax boiler in Malung burned down and with it many of his recipes and ongoing experiments. He then joined the Astra company to work scientifically on new recipes. Here, he developed “Swix” one of the first synthetic waxes, which came on the market in 1946. The wax had its breakthrough when it was used by a Swedish gold medalist in 1948. In the following years, he developed additional wax types for ski jumping and alpine skiing. For 34 years he worked in Södertälje as marketing chief and tester. When the company’s research section moved to Norway in 1974, he remained in Södertälje. In 1937 he was appointed “Stor Grabb” (literally Big Boy) in skiing, an honorary award in Swedish sports. He was featured in the documentary film “De sista skidåkarna” (The Last Skiers) in 1988, also known under the name “Förra tidens människa” (Men of the Past). On his 90th birthday in 2001, he received the Peder Smith Medal, the highest award of his hometown Hedemora. The Matsboloppet is a national cross-country race in Hedemora for children and youngsters, named after Martin Matsbo.",Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the World Nordic Ski Championships (0–0–2 1935 Vysoké Tatry CCS bronze: 4×10 km relay; 1936 Garmisch-Partenkirchen (Olympics) CCS bronze: 4×10 km relay; 1941 Cortina d'Ampezzo MSP gold (unofficial))

Karlsson won Olympic gold in the 50 km race at the 1948 Winter Olympics. In his other three individual appearances in St. Moritz and again in Oslo in 1952 he came close to the medals and was placed fifth – twice in the 18 km - and sixth in the 50 km. At the 1950 World Championships he won a bronze medal in the 50K. At the Holmenkollen Ski Festival Karlsson won the 50 km in 1947 and 1951. He won a total of 37 national championships, including 17 individual, and during his career he participated in 256 races, placing in the top six in 246 of them. Competing 10 times, Mora-Nisse also won nine Vasa runs (1943, 1945-51, 1953), which finished in his hometown of Mora. In 1944 he was second and he was ill in 1952. His last victory in record time was achieved while still wearing wooden skis. After he finished his active career, Karlsson joined the Vasa run’s organization team and worked as both race director and course manager for 17 years. He was awarded the Swedish Dagbladet Medal in 1944 for “the first Swedish Championship triple in Boden.” In 1952, he was the second Swedish cross-country skier to receive the Holmenkollen medal. In 1953 Karlsson published his autobiography I Vita Spar (In White Tracks). In connection with his 65th birthday Mora-Nisse’s Jubilee Fund was instituted, which supports young ski talents aged 17-20 years in Sweden. He led the country’s Olympic and World Cup cross-country ski team from 1954-66, but he lived in his native village all his life, where a road was also named after him during his lifetime, and where he ran his own sporting goods store “Mora-Nisse Sports.” Even at the age of 90, he did exercises every day and managed his garden and household. Two grandchildren of Mora-Nisse have been successful in the Vasa run.

Her parents, both originally from Germany (her father from Schöningen), were naturalized British citizens and worked as dressmakers in London. The family lived just a five minute walk south from Hyde Park, where the children spent her early years and attended primary schooling. The Klüpfel family moved to Switzerland by the early 1930s, and Anita first became active in the sport of fencing as a member of the Akademischer Fechtclub in Zürich. She moved to Basel in 1939 and joined the local fencing club there, winning her first national title in women’s foil in the following year. Klüpfel successfully defended her title in 1941, but was defeated by Yvonne Bornand in the next year. She won the national women’s title once again in 1945, and also won at an international tournament held in Lugano in June 1946 between Swiss and Italian fencers. However, she was later defeated in October of that year by Maddalena Schiefer of Lugano for the national women’s foil title. Klüpfel was the runner-up in the 1947 Swiss women’s foil championships held in her hometown of Basel, behind Vera Hagemann, and finished third in 1948, behind Hedwig Rieder and Bornand. In 1948, she represented Switzerland at the Women’s World Championships in Den Haag, and was one of three female fencers selected to represent Switzerland at the London Olympics, alongside her Basel clubmates Hagemann and Rieder. All competed in the women’s foil event, with Klüpfel emerging as the most successful of the three, advancing to the quarter finals. She was once again a member of the national team in 1950 alongside Rieder, traveling to Monaco to compete at the world championships there. Klüpfel remained active in competition until she was almost 60-years-old, even competing in an international tournament in 1960, with the Neue Zürcher Zeitung affectionately labeling her as the “indestructible old master Klüpfel” in their event recap.

Fixdal went to Kristiania for the last qualifying competition in late June, after showing good form with a PB of 13.63 in triple jump in a local competition in Haugesund in May. After a second place in long jump with 6.83, only four centimetres behind Bie, he was selected for the Olympic team in both events.

Before this, however, he skated in eight games with the Boston Bruins during the 1924-1925 season in his only National Hockey League appearances.

He mainly produced larger-than-life sculptures of well-known public figures. His brother Edgar Melville Ward was also an artist. John Quincy’s sculpture, Indian Hunter with his Dog, was submitted posthumously to the 1928 Art Competitions in Amsterdam. In this sculpture, Ward successfully imparted directness and naturalism by relying on the tactile and expressive qualities of bronze. Early, smaller versions were already created in the 1850s. The statue, cast in 1866 and unveiled in 1869, was the first sculpture by an American artist to be erected in New York’s Central Park.

He was the first person to win the Olympic marathon consecutively, doing so in 1960 and 1964. His marathon career began only a few months before the Rome Olympics in 1960, when he won a trial race in the altitude of Addis Ababa. Between that race and a marathon he won in Seoul in October 1966, Bikila ran 13 marathons, winning 12, losing at the 1963 Boston Marathon, in which he finished fifth. He sustained an injury in 1967 and never fully recovered, which caused him to withdraw after starting the 1968 Olympic marathon Mexico City. Late in 1969, Bikila was in a car accident, and the injuries he sustained rendered him a quadriparetic. After treatment at Stoke Mandeville Hospital, his condition improved to paraplegic, and he even competed as an archer in the 1969 Stoke Mandeville Games, the forerunner of the Paralympic Games.

Despite her youth, she won a silver medal in the long jump behind Poland’s Elżbieta Krzesińska. She also competed in the long jump at the 1960, 1964, 1968, and 1972 Olympics, where she made the finals each time, although never again as a medalist. However, in 1964, she ran a leg on the USA’s 4×100 metre relay team, and earned a second silver medal. White’s 19-11¾ (6.09) long jump, which won her 1956 silver medal, was a US national record. She eventually set seven USA records in the long jump, her last being 21-6 (6.55) in 1964, a mark which stood until 1972. In her career, she won 13 national indoor and outdoor titles, and competed on 34 international teams, including the 1959, 1963, 1967, and 1971 Pan American teams for the United States. There she won gold in 1963 and bronze in 1959 and 1967 long jump. At the 1963 Pan American Games she also won gold with the 4×100 metres team (with Vivian Brown, Marilyn White, and the non-Olympian Norma Harris). Despite her athletic career she may be less remembered for that than her legacy as a person. One of her 1960 Olympic teammates, Donna de Varona, later a close friend, noted, “She grew up before the civil rights movement and overcame all the hurdles she had as an African-American woman.” White later commented, “I started in athletics because athletics was my flight to freedom. Freedom from the delta cotton fields, bias, and prejudice of the South. I had no other choice. … Before my first Olympics, I though the whole world consisted of cross burnings and lynchings.” She also noted of her Olympic career, “The Olympic Movement taught me not to judge a person by the color of their skin but by the contents of their hearts. I am who I am because of my participation in sports.” White attended Tennesee State University, where she competed for the renowned Tigerbelles track & field teams. She moved to Chicago in 1960 and became a nurse, first at Cook County Hospital, then at the Greenwood Medical Center. In 1965 she became a public health administrator at the Chicago Health Department. Though she had not originally graduated from college, she returned to school and earned a bachelor’s degree from Chicago State University in 1976. White remained active in sports, teaching and coaching athletes. She coached and managed at the 1981 World Cup and was head coach at the 1994 US Olympic Festival. In 1990, she founded WBW Hang on Productions, a sports and fitness consultancy. In 1991 she founded the Willye White Foundation, helping children to become productive citizens by teaching sports and teamwork to children in the nation’s largest housing project. The Foundation included an after-school program, a summer day-camp, and healthcare for the children. De Varona noted, “For all the struggles she went through, she always gave back, she was always campaigning for equal education, equal rights.” Another Olympic teammate, Pat Connolly (1960), spoke of her, “She was like a big sister. … It was a very unlikely friendship. I was raised a Mormon. … I knew nothing about blacks. … I had my eyes opened when I made the Olympic team and Wilma Rudolph and Cassius Clay and all these people became my teammates, but it was Willye who helped me learn and understand everything I needed to know. … She was one of America’s best ambassadors for sport and humanity.” Personal Bests: 100 – 11.5 (1964); LJ – 21-6 (6.55) (1964).",Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the Summer Pan American Games (2–0–2 1959 Chicago ATH bronze: long jump; 1963 São Paulo ATH gold: long jump and 4×100 m relay; 1967 Winnipeg ATH bronze: long jump)

In 1942 he was mobilized with the Red Army, serving as a machine gunner with the 69th Guards Rifle Division. Parfyonov saw action in October 1943 on the banks of Dnepr and was wounded twice in the elbow and arm in a battle near village Hradyzk on the east bank of Dnepr. After recovering from his injuries, Parfyonov continued to serve with the Red Army, this time as a driver-mechanic with the 108th Tank Brigade. Parfyonov was demobilized from the Army in 1946 and resumed his work as a mechanic in a spinning and weaving factory. Parfyonov did not take up wrestling until 1951, when he was already 26-years-old. Within three years, however, in 1954, he won his first Soviet Greco-Roman heavyweight title, a victory he repeated in 1957. Only five years after taking up wrestling, Parfyonov became an Olympic champion. The 1956 Olympic Games Greco-Roman heavyweight title was his only international title and international tournament. Domestically, in addition to his 1954 and 1957 Soviet titles, Parfyonov also won Greco-Roman heavyweight bronze at the 1956 and 1959 Soviet Championships. As Parfyonov took up wrestling at quite an old age, he was not a very technical wrestler, but he compensated for his lack of technique with great strength. According to the 1964 Olympic freestyle heavyweight champion Aleksandr Ivanitsky, Parfyonov was physically stronger than the great Aleksandr Karelin, who is considered one of the greatest Greco-Roman wrestlers of all time. After finishing his sporting career, Parfyonov worked as a wrestling coach in his native Moscow, his most famous pupil being the 1976 Olympic Greco-Roman heavyweight champion Nikolay Balboshin. At the end of 1960s and start of 1970s, Parfyonov also tried his hand in acting, having small roles in various Soviet movies and TV serials, most notably as a German security guard in a Soviet 1973 blockbuster TV miniseries “Seventeen Moments of Spring.” Since 1999 an international memorial tournament in his honor has been held in Moscow and a minor planet, 7913 Parfyonov, is named after him.",Listed in Olympians With Asteroids Named After Them (7913 Parfenov)

He was one of the first athletes who was able to earn money with product endorsements. In 1937 he joined the Nazi-Party NSDAP, while from 1940 to 1945 he fought in World War II and was not released from British captivity until 1946.

His last international medal win was the silver medal at the 1938 World Championships. After the World War II, Ismayr made headlines as a pacifist, a party official of the German Peace Union DFU, and a categorical opponent of the re-introduction of compulsory military service. He was therefore denied any promotion in the Bavarian civil service as an administrative lawyer. Ismayr was actually one of the very few German 1936 Olympic athletes who actively distanced themselves from the Nazis after the war. In 1980 he was guest of honor at the German Weightlifting Championships and argued vehemently against the boycott of the 1980 Moskva Olympic Games.

The young Guglielmetti first survived being run over by a taxi without any injuries, later to be followed by a fall from a four-story building. He survived this fall by clinging on to electrical cables hanging outside. Originally starting out as a pole vaulter, Guglielmetti also started practicing gymnastics. In 1927, he joined the Milanese club Pro Patria 1883, where he was coached by Mario Corrias. He became a member of the national team in 1930, and was sent to the 1932 Olympics in Los Angeles. The Italian gymnastics team arrived in Los Angeles after a 17-day journey. During the last five days, the team traveled by train. At each stop, the coach ordered his gymnasts to run a lap around the train, to keep in shape. This proved to be effective, as the Italians won the team event, and three individual medals. Romeo Neri won the individual all-around, and the parallel bars, while Guglielmetti secured first place in the horse vault event. In addition, he placed 5th in the all-around. The 1932 Games were also successful for his club, which was represented by Luigi Beccali (gold in the 1,500 m) and Ugo Frigerio (bronze in the 50 km. race walking) Guglielmetti won the Italian all-around title for the first time in 1934, and repeated this feat in 1935, 1937, 1938 and 1939. As the best gymnast of his country, he again represented Italy at the 1936 Olympics, but he could not take his teammates to a medal, and finished 5th in the team competition, 12th in the individual all-around. After the war, Guglielmetti achieved another 5th place with his team at the London Olympics. After his active career, Guglielmetti remained involved in the Italian gymnastics federation and his club Pro Patria.

She won golds in all-around and vault and silvers in uneven bars and balance beam at the 1995 World Championships and went on to the 1996 season as one of the clear favorites at the Olympics. But her Olympic hopes were nearly trashed by a serious injury sustained when she fell from the beam in practice in early 1996. But Podkopaieva recovered well, and at the European Championships won gold in all-around, uneven bars and floor exercise and bronzes in vault and team event, and at the Olympic Games won the all-around and floor exercise titles and silver on balance beam. Originally Podkopaieva did not intend to retire after the 1996 Olympics, but injuries prevented her from competing for two seasons after the Olympics and forced her retirement in 1998. But she did not leave gymnastics, as since 2002 she has organized a Golden Lily tournament in Kyiv. She was certified as an international brevet judge in 2004, and also coaches extensively in America and Ukraine. She has also hosted a gymnastics TV-show “Aerobics for Champions.” Podkopaieva is the Ukrainian United Nations Goodwill Ambassador for HIV/AIDS and Ukraine’s Ambassador of Sport to the Council of Europe. In 2006, she won the Ukrainian version of Dancing with the Stars, and represented Ukraine at the 2008 Eurovision Dance Contest.",

Both he and his son were affiliated with the Lambton Golf and Country Club of Toronto, which had been founded by the elder Austin. With a score of 230, nearly 50 more strokes than was acceptable to qualify, he finished in 73rd place, ahead of only Lee Jones’ final result of 240 and Charles Cory, who withdrew after the first qualifying round. He did not, however, have to rely on his athletic prowess to earn his fame. He arrived in Winnipeg, Manitoba in 1880 and quickly decided that something needed to be done about the traffic congestion on Main Street. Within a year he had borrowed the idea of the horse-drawn street railway system from his home town (which had been in place since the 1850s) and founded The Winnipeg Street Railway Company in 1881. The company began operating the following year but, by 1888, Austin realized that his vision would soon need to encompass electric street cars. He was at the forefront of the movement that developed the first electric street car manufactured in Canada that, in 1891, became part of the first commercial electric street railway system in the nation. He later became president of the Toronto-Dominion Bank, which his father had founded in 1871, as well as chair of its board of directors, and also maintained a fruit farm in Port Dalhousie, Ontario. He died in July 1934, after suffering from illness for nearly two and a half years.",Father of Albert E. Austin

In Russia, he first studied politics in St. Petersburg. In 1903, he began studying painting and sculpture in Paris with Auguste Rodin. There, Yuryevich was a secretary at the Russian Embassy and later became cultural attaché. In French, his name was spelled Serge Youriévitch, which he used. At that time, he also headed an institute for psychology. Subsequently, Yuryevich lived temporarily in Switzerland and Italy before devoting himself entirely to sculpture and opening a studio in Paris above that of Rodin. When World War I broke out, he returned to Russia. After the October Revolution, he emigrated to France, and received French citizenship in 1933. Youriévitch became an accomplished sculptor and in 1930 made a bust of Franklin D. Roosevelt, then Governor of New York. Another bust he created was of Thomas Hardy, the English novelist and poet. Youriévitch also contributed to British art, including sporting art and modern sculpture. He also focused on garden and fountain pieces. In 1957 he obtained American citizenship. Youriévitch taught sculpture at the Guildford School of Art in the 1950s. Strangely enough, Youriévitch is not listed as a competitor in the Official Report. He is mentioned, though, in the exhibition guide with two of his works. His Wrestler (Le Lutteur) is a 1 m tall plaster sculpture that was acquired by Luxembourg. His best-known figure, widespread in different versions, is that of The Dancer Nattova (La Danseuse Nattova). Natasha Nattova (1905-1988), born as Natalia Schmit, fled to France because of the October Revolution. She later turned to modern dance and became a famous vaudeville dancer in the 1920s. The plaster model was commissioned by the city of Paris and first exhibited in the Salon d’Automne in Paris in 1923. The original bronze from 1924 was about 75 cm high and was melted down during the occupation during World War II.",Listed in Olympian Members of the Nobility (Prince) Listed in Olympians of Royal Blood (Prince)

Vasilakos won the marathon at the Panhellenic Games in a time of three hours and 18 minutes, becoming the first champion in the discipline in the process. The marathon race at the 1896 Athína Olympics took place on 10 April with 17 runners taking to the start line. Vasilakos finished in second place behind compatriot Spyros Louis. The races at both the Panhellenic Games and the Olympics were run on a 40km course instead of the now-standard distance of 42.195km. Following the Athína Olympics Vasilakos established and competed in racewalking in Greece. In 1900 he won the 1,000 metres racewalk and finished in fifth place in the 1,500 metres racewalk at the 1906 Intercalated Games.

He moved to København and married the niece of former Olympic champion, Henry Hansen. In 1960, Enemark Jensen rode for Denmark in the team time trial at the Nordic Championships, helping them to a silver medal, and was selected for the Olympic team. The day of the Roma team time trial was extremely hot, with temperatures reaching 42° C. (108° F.). Both Enemark Jensen and his teammate, Jørgen Jørgensen had difficulty with the heat. About 20 km from the finish, Enemark Jensen collapsed and fell from the effects of heatstroke, hitting his head. He was quickly taken by military ambulance to Sant Eugenio Hospital, but fell into a coma and died later that day. The cause of death was listed as a brain injury secondary to a skull fracture from the fall. However, great controversy surrounded the incident, as a trainer for the Danish team admitted that he had given the riders Roniacol, an amphetamine-like substance that acts as a peripheral vasodilator, although he later retracted that statement. But initial reports from the hospital noted that Enemark Jensen’s toxicology screen contained multiple drugs, including various amphetamines. This was later denied by the authorities, and later Danish cycling, and Rome reports do not mention drugs as a possible cause of death and attribute it solely to the skull fracture. However, Davis Maraniss’s book Rome 1960: The Olympics that Changed the World, noted, “Decades later a Danish journalist tracked down Doctor Alberto Marpiori, one the Italians who had performed Jensen’s autopsy. The doctor said that he remembered the case well as it was the first time his institute had found evidence of doping. He said several substances, including amphetamines, were found in Jensen’s system.” Enemark Jensen’s death was one impetus that led the IOC to begin testing for drugs at the 1968 Olympic Games.",Listed in Athletes Who Died During the Olympics (Collapsed of heatstroke during competition and suffered a fatal brain injury.)

A week later, he suffered a similar fete during his second attempt. At the Paris Olympics, Ashe won a bronze medal in the single sculls but his greatest moment was in winning the 1904 Wingfield Sculls at Henley. This made up for his disappointment of not winning the Diamond Sculls, despite many attempts. His best finish was second to Irishman Charles Fox in 1901. Ashe came close to winning the Wingfield on two other occasions, finishing second to Harry Blackstaffe in both 1905 and 1906. A controversial member of the Thames Rowing Club from 1895, Ashe was suspended by them on many occasions for clashes with officials of the club and also for regular “ungentlemanly conduct”, which resulted in his disqualification from many races. Having already qualified as a solicitor, Ashe went to Trinity College Cambridge as an undergraduate at the age of 29. During his second year at Cambridge, he concentrated on cycling and running, rather than rowing. He also represented Cambridge in a speed skating match against Oxford at Davros. In 1907 Ashe married a wealthy woman, 15 years older than him.

69218,Tom Kiely,Male,25 August 1869,,, Great Britain,GBR,"After winning the All-Around event at the 1904 Olympics in St. Louis, Tom Kiely was not, for some unknown reason, immediately recognized as an Olympic champion. It was not until 1954, following representations from Dr. Ferenc Mező of Hungary, that the International Olympic Committee rectified the mistake. Kiely faced a monumental task in St. Louis; the ten events by which all-around ability was measured were all contested in a single day, in the following order: 100 yards, shot put, high jump, 120 yards hurdles, 880 yards walk, hammer throw, pole vault, 56-lb. weight throw, long jump and the mile. Kiely won four of the events and finished 120 points ahead of the American Adam Gunn, with the hammer thrower and four-time All-American guard on the Penn football team, Truxtun Hare, in third place. When the English authorities learned that Kiely had been invited to the 1904 Olympics, they offered to pay his expenses on the condition that he represented the United Kingdom. Kiely declined the offer saying he would represent Ireland. In fact he entered the competition as “Tom Kiely from Ireland and Tipperary” and traveled to America at his own expense but on his arrival in New York, he was offered further financial inducements by the New York, AC, the Irish-American AC and the Chicago AAC to represent them in St. Louis. Again Kiely declined and it should be noted that apart from the Olympic nature of the St. Louis Games, they also served as the unofficial club championships of the USA; for this reason, the leading American clubs were anxious to have the Irish all-rounder on their team. Tom Kiely was introduced to the sport and subsequently coached by his near neighbors and distant relatives the Davin brothers, Pat, Tom and Maurice, who were among the greatest all-rounders in the history of Irish athletes. Initially Kiely excelled as a triple jumper and hurdler but later, when some of his speed deserted him, he became an outstanding hammer thrower. He won his first GAA athletics title on 10 September 1892 and in that one afternoon won a total of seven titles. He went on to win the AAA hammer title five times and was twice runner-up in seven appearances between 1895 and 1902 and his defeat at the hands of John Flanagan at the 1900 Championships represented one of the major setbacks of his career. Kiely had been training with the Paris Olympics in mind, but after losing to Flanagan by a margin of more than 24 feet (7.32) at the AAA meet, he abandoned his Olympic aspirations and did not make the journey to Paris. In June 1899 he had set a world record of 162-0 (49.38) and although this only lasted for 46 days as a world best, it was the first time that anyone had thrown beyond the 160 feet mark. The winner of the 1904 Olympic All-Around event was also considered to be the American champion for that year, and Tom Kiely again crossed the Atlantic in 1906 and won his second US title. Between 1892 and 1908 Kiely won 70 gold medals in Irish, British, American and World Championship events, ranging from the hammer to the hop step and jump, sprint and hurdles. His last competition was at Buttervant, County Cork in 1908 when he broke his shoulder after hitting a hurdle and falling. Kiely was also a noted Gaelic footballer and Hurler. He was captain of the Grangemockler football team and was also selected to play for Tipperary and in 1896 was selected for the Munster Hurling team that played Leinster in London. He refereed a game between Tipperary and Kilkenny in New York in 1906. To add further to his versatility, Kiely was a fine Irish dancer and fiddle and flute player. After his sporting travels were over, Kiely settled on his farm in native Ballyneal near Carrick-on-Suir, which was the birthplace of one of Ireland’s greatest sporting heroes, cyclist Sean Kelly. In his competitive days, Kiely had done much of his training at the same farm.

Swimming for Colorado State, she qualified for the 1994 World Championships, where she medalled in the 50 m freestyle (bronze), as well as with two relay squads. After victories at the 1995 Pan Pacific Championships and Pan American Games, and a world record in early 1996, Van Dyken was slated to become one of swimming’s stars at the Atlanta Olympics. She won four Olympic golds (the first US woman to achieve this in a single Olympics), earning them in the 50 m free, 100 m butterfly, and the freestyle and medley relays. She narrowly missed the podium in the 100 m freestyle, coming home in fourth. Despite bouts with injury, Van Dyken added to her prize cabinet at the 1998 Worlds, winning three golds (50 m free plus two relay golds). In Sydney Van Dyken added two golds to her tally in the relays, while placing fourth in the 50 m freestyle. Although later honored with induction into the International Swimming Hall of Fame, Van Dyken was a somewhat controversial swimmer, who spit into the lanes of her opponents on occasion. In 2003 she was interrogated as a client of BALCO in the steroids scandal, which involved many high profile athletes, such as athlete Marion Jones and baseball player Barry Bonds, although Van Dyken was never directly implicated in PED usage. Van Dyken married American football player Tom Rouen, long-time player for the Denver Broncos, with whom he won the Super Bowl twice. Van Dyken became a popular media personality in her home state of Colorado. She served as host of several radio and television sports programs and she and her husband became very involved in charitable work. She also coached the varsity swim team at Notre Dame Preparatory High School in Scottsdale, Arizona for a time. In June 2014 Van Dyken was injured in an ATV accident which severely damaged her spinal cord and initial reports were that she would remain paralyzed with a severed spinal cord at the T11 level, despite decompression and stabilizing surgery. However, showing the determination and spirit she had shown in her athletic career, she vowed to fight this and overcome it, and in mid-August 2014 Van Dyken actually was able to walk with braces and a walker, something which many thought would never happen. Her story has been an emotional one bringing inspiration to many spinal cord injured patients.","Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the Summer Pan American Games (3–1–0 1995 Mar del Plata SWI gold: 100 m butterfly, 4×100 m freestyle relay, and 4×100 m medley relay, silver: 100 m freestyle) Listed in Olympians Who Set a World Record in Long Course Swimming (4×100 m freestyle relay – 16 September 2000 - 29 July 2002: 3:36.61 (16 September 2000; Sydney, AUS)) Listed in Olympians Who Set a World Record in Short Course Swimming (50 m butterfly – 1 February 1995 - 12 February 1995: 26.73 (1 February 1995; Espoo, FIN); 100 m butterfly – 1995 - 2 December 1995: 58.73 ( 1995; Gelsenkirchen, GER)) Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the Pan Pacific Swimming Championships (2–2–0 1995 Atlanta gold: 50 m freestyle and 4×100 m freestyle relay, silver: 100 m freestyle and 4×100 m medley relay) Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the World Aquatics Championships (3–2–1 1994 Roma SWI silver: 4×100 m freestyle relay and 4×100 m medley relay, bronze: 50 m freestyle; 1998 Perth SWI gold: 50 m freestyle, 4×100 m freestyle relay, and 4×100 m medley relay)"

English lawns, paddocks, manicured boxes, and a life of horses have been Fantoni’s life who, after a life dedicated to dressage, did her best in breeding equine breeds such as the English Thoroughbred and the Trakehner.

This gained him selection for the London Olympics. At the Games, he caught his toes on the board while attempting a reverse dive, which cost him dearly, and brought a final placing of 23rd. Elliott retained his national title in 1949, and won it for the third consecutive year in 1950 before regaining it in 1952. He was also the New York State diving champion in 1955, which he entered while visiting the USA. After a second Olympics appearance in 1952, Elliott was in big demand for exhibitions and appeared in the popular Aquashow. In the mid-to-late-1950s, Elliott sought a change of direction and joined the “pop” revolution, becoming a singer, with his début single To The Aisle (1957), being a minor hit. He appeared on the same bill as the British singing sensation of the day, Cliff Richard. Elliott also appeared on the West End stage in the musicals Guys and Dolls and Wish You Were Here.

921682,George Finch,Male,4 August 1888,,, Australia,AUS,"From the age of 14, when he first went up Mount Canobolas near to his home at Orange, in Australia, George Finch knew that he wanted to climb mountains. Shortly afterwards, the family moved to Europe, firstly to Paris where Finch started medical studies at the École de Medicine in Paris, but, after finding physics and chemistry more interesting, he moved to Switzerland where he studied at the Federal Institute of Technology. Having scaled the walls of the Notre Dame Cathedral under moonlight, as a daredevil stunt with his brother Max during their time in Paris, Finch, living in Switzerland, now had the opportunity to climb some of the great Alpine peaks. Most weekends and holidays, he spent his time climbing in the Alps, and set his sights high right from the start, climbing such memorable peaks as the Eiger and Matterhorn. Being unconventional, Finch normally sought to take more difficult routes up these mountains, and without the aid of professional guides. He also used innovative new techniques and equipment frowned upon by the Alpine Club. These included the used of oxygen filled cylinders for use at high altitude, and a padded jacket he designed for protection from the cold. This was the forerunner of the Puffer jacket, Finch moved to London in 1913 and got a research job, firstly at the Royal Arsenal and then at the Imperial College, London. When World War I broke out, he volunteered for the Royal Artillery, but did not see action until being sent to Salonika, Greece, in January 1916. His actions in bringing down the German fighter ace Rudolf von Eschwege in 1917 resulted in Finch receiving an MBE. During the Blitz in World War II, he developed a fire-fighting technique that helped London from further damage. When Finch returned to England after the World War I, he found his new bride had a baby called Peter, born September 1916. It may have been Finch’s, but it could also been that of an India Army Officer, captain Jock Campbell, with whom Finch’s wife Alicia had had an affair. This baby went on to become Hollywood actor Peter Finch and it was not until he was in his mid-40’s that Peter Finch discovered that George Finch was possibly not his biological father, despite being brought up by Finch’s mother in France. George Finch was chosen for the 1922 Mount Everest Expedition, although it was not a popular choice by many, including the expedition leader Charles Bruce. It was said Finch was not a popular member of the team because he was the only Australian in an all-British (and Gurkhas) group. His unpopularity, however, was probably down to the fact that he was anti-establishment and, unlike the ever-popular George Mallory, was not a Cambridge man. On the expedition, Finch was in charge of the bottled oxygen system he had devised, despite the fact the team leaders were against its use. Finch, and Geoffrey Bruce, cousin of the expedition leader, got to within 530 metres of the summit, however, with the aid of oxygen. It was the nearest the expedition got to the summit. Finch and Mallory returned to England as national heroes, but in Australia, the achievement only got a brief mention in a couple of regional newspapers. For his part in the expedition, Finch and the team were awarded an Olympic gold medal by Pierre de Coubertin in February 1924. Finch toured Britain and Europe giving talks about the expedition but, because he was loathed by many, including Arthur Hinks, secretary of the Mount Everest Committee, Finch was banned by Hinks from holding these lectures in Europe. When Edmund Hillary and Sherpa Tenzing Norgay became the first men to eventually conquer Everest in 1953, Hilary was quick to acknowledge Finch and the oxygen equipment they used, which was based on Finch’s original design. Finch was not chosen for the 1924 Everest expedition, with his place in charge of the oxygen being taken by Sandy Irvine who, with Mallory, got to within a few hundred metres of the summit, before they perished on the mountain. Many wondered how different it would have been had it been Mallory and Finch who made that last push for the summit instead of Mallory and Irvine. Finch quit climbing in 1931 and concentrated on his career as a scientist and became a professor at the Imperial College and Member of the Royal Society. He was responsible for producing commercial nitrogen fertilizer that would help in food production all over the world. For relaxation, Finch enjoyed nothing more than sailing on British waters with his wife and daughters.",

47219,Ronnie Burns,Male,10 April 1933,,, Great Britain,GBR,"At the 1950 Scottish Swimming Championships, 17-year-old Ronnie Burns of Pullar’s Amateur Swimming Club (now Perth City Swim Club) caused a sensation by finishing second to Scotland’s leading freestyler Jack Wardrop in the 440 yards final. Shortly afterwards, Burns was selected as a reserve for the triangular meeting for the Bologna Trophy between Scotland, England and Wales. The following year at Kilmarnock, he won his first international “cap” in the same competition. Scotland won the trophy for the second successive year, and these were the only two occasions that they lifted the trophy in its 32-year history. By 1951, Burns was serving in the Royal Air Force (RAF) doing his National Service. He swam for the RAF and competed in inter-services events. In 1952 Burns took the Scottish national record for the 200 yards free to under two minutes at his home town of Perth, when his time of 1:58.8 knocked 5.7 secs off the old record. Buns went to the Helsinki Olympics that same year as the first Perth Olympian, and he reached the semi-final of the 400 metres free, albeit as the slowest of the qualifiers. As the semi-final was on the same day as the 4x200 free relay final, however, Burns withdrew from the individual event to save himself for the relay but, unfortunately, the British quartet could only finish sixth. Despite winning Scottish titles, Burns never won an ASA national title but came close in the 440 in 1951 when he was second to Jack Wardrop. A journalist since he left school, Burns worked for several newspapers, including the Daily Mirror, and he also branched into television. He commentated for BBC on swimming broadcasts and was appointed producer of the popular regional BBC television news programme Look North. Following a meeting with athlete Brendan Foster in 1979, Burns took up Masters swimming and became one of the top Masters swimmers in the North of England, and in 1981 he conquered America. Burns competed in what was regarded as the best Masters meet in the world, the US Masters Short Course Championships, and he won six freestyle and backstroke medals in the 45-50 age group. Burns’ time for the 100 free was faster than when he swam the distance as a 17-year-old.",

Besides the gymnastics events he entered the all-around competition in track & field. At that sport, however, his participation lasted only a few seconds; as in the first event – the 100 yard dash – he pulled up lame after only a few yards. Emmerich won the triathlon in the gymnastics program, but it was really a track & field competition. It consisted of the 100 yard dash, long jump, and shot put, and was a part of the 12 event all-around competition. In 1909 Emmerich, a bank clerk at the Capitol National Bank in Indianapolis, suddenly disappeared. Suspicious bank officials examined his accounts and brought in the Pinkerton Detective Agency when it became apparent that fraudulent transactions had taken place. Emmerich was tracked by a Pinkerton detective to a motel in Jacksonville, Florida, from where he was about to leave for South America, arrested and returned to Indiana. Emmerich, fellow Olympian Harry Prinzler and another conspirator were each sentenced to five years in prison for embezzling $40,000. When released in 1913 he returned to accountancy.",

It was built in less than two years time (1929-31) and officially opened on 11 July 1931 at the 2nd Workers’ Olympics. Schweizer also built the adjacent stadium pool, at the time the largest outdoor pool in Europe.

In 1955 he finally captured gold in the four man, alongside Angst, Gottfried Diener, and Robert Alt, and also earned bronze in the two man with Angst. As the defending World Champions, Kapus and his crew were the favorites at the 1956 Winter Olympics and they did not disappoint, winning gold (and three of the four races) in the four man. At age 46, Kapus became the oldest man to pilot an Olympic gold medal-winning bobsled team and the second oldest Olympic bobsled champion, after J. J. O’Brien’s, distinctions he retains as of 2012.

Prior to taking up bobsledding, he had been active in gymnastics, swimming, wrestling, and boxing, and was a mechanic by career.","Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the World Bob & Skeleton Championships (FIBT/IBSF) (1–0–3 1950 Cortina d'Ampezzo bronze: Four-man; 1951 Alpe d'Huez bronze: Four-man; 1955 St. Moritz gold: Four-man, bronze: Two-man)"

Jackson became a career Naval officer, eventually reaching the rank of rear admiral. In August 1964 Jackson was involved in controversial actions aboard the US destroyer USS Maddox in the Gulf of Tonkin during the Vietnam War. On 2 August the USS Maddox was attacked by three North Vietnamese torpedo patrol boats, and returned fire, damaging all three boats. On 4 August, it was reported that the Maddox, and another destroyer, was attacked again by North Vietnamese forces, but they were again successful in warding them off. In response, US President Lyndon B. Johnson pushed the Tonkin Gulf Resolution through Congress, authorizing US forces to “take all necessary measures” to repel attacks on American forces. It later turned out that the USS Maddox was not on routine patrol either night but on intelligence gathering missions. Further, long after the war ended, North Vietnamese generals insisted that no such attack had occurred. Jackson received numerous awards for his military service, which also included service in the Korean War, including a Navy Commendation Medal with Combat V, and two Bronze Stars. He retired from active duty in 1983 after commanding the anti-submarine warfare project with the Naval Material Command and serving as deputy commander of the combat systems directorate at the headquarters of Naval Sea Systems Command.

It was in Tokyo that she emulated her mother’s feat and brought home a bronze medal in the sprint relay. Simpson continued her progress in 1965 and 1966 by winning consecutive Women’s AAA 200 m titles and picking up another sprint relay medal, a silver, at the 1966 Commonwealth Games but then took a sabbatical from the track in 1967 before returning as a 400 m runner in the Olympic year of 1968. She showed a continuous improvement in her one lap running throughout the season culminating in a 4th place finish in the Olympic 400 m final where she took a clear second off her personal best. A finalist in the individual 400 m at the 1969 European Championship it was her performance as part of the Great Britain 4×400 m team that was arguably the greatest of her career. Combining with Pat Lowe, Rosemary Stirling and Lillian Board against an equally strong French team the British foursome won a desperately close race in a new world record time. Although she retired at the end of 1969 she returned for one more tilt at the Olympic Games in 1972 and though she failed to progress from the heats of the individual event she once again was part of a relay squad that reached the Olympic final as Great Britain placed fifth in the 4×400 m.

Thorleif grew up in Oslo not far away from Holmenkollen, and showed an early talent for ski jumping. In 1940, aged 20, he placed fourth at Holmenkollen, but World War II halted his ski jumping career for five years. In 1946 he was second at Holmenkollen, and in 1947 he was second in the National Championship, placing third in 1948, qualifying for a spot on the Norwegian Olympic team. After his Olympic bronze medal in St. Moritz, he took another second place at Holmenkollen. Later in 1948 he finished his law studies at the Oslo University as a qualified lawyer, but he continued to compete in ski jumping until 1953. He became the first Norwegian ski jumper to jump further than 100 m, when he landed a 106 m jump in Planica, Yugoslavia on 15 March 1950. After his active career he became an excellent ski jumping coach, working for the Italian team from 1953-56, after which he coached the Norwegian team until 1962. Thorleif Schjelderup became a well-known author, environmentalist, photographer and was popular promoting various causes, travelling around in Norway to promote outdoor activities and environmentalism. He published 10 books, mainly on the subjects of ski jumping and nature. In 1973 he published the first ever Norwegian textbook on environmentalism for the elementary school. Schjelderup was an idealist his whole life, and a strong advocate for ideas he believed in, playing an important role making the Norwegian people aware of important environmentalist questions. Schjelderup was married to actress Sossen Krogh from 1942-47. In 1948 he married the black US born opera singer Anne Brown, but they divorced in 1969.

He belonged to a wealthy family, and was active in many sports, including tennis, rugby, rowing and yachting. In 1948, he drove his first racing car, a Mercedes. In 1950, after having won the Argentine sportscar championship, he was invited to join his fellow countrymen, Juan Manuel Fangio and Froilán González, for some races in Europe. Driving a Ferrari, he placed fourth in the Geneva GP, a non-championship race. After that, Mieres was absent from the European circuits for several years, until Gordini offered him a ride for the 1953 season. Mieres drove three races, placing sixth in the Italian GP. For the next season, he entered the first five races of the season as a privateer, racing his own Maserati. Following the death of the Argentine Maserati driver Onofre Marimón at the German GP, Mieres was invited to join the Maserati factory team. This move immediately proved successful, with Mieres scoring fourth places in both Switzerland and Spain, and eventually sharing eighth place in the championship. He stayed with the Maserati team for 1955. During the season opener, in front of his home crowd in Buenos Aires, Mieres briefly lead the race, but eventually finished fifth . But Maserati was no match to the strong Mercedes-Benz cars, and Mieres again placed eighth in the championship. The Dutch GP at Zandvoort was his best race, placing fourth, but recording the fastest lap. After the season, Mieres went back to Argentina, not to appear in the European racing scene again, although he would make appearances in the Buenos Aires 1000 km sportscar race in 1957 and 1958. Mieres switched his focus from racing to sailing, and this resulted in qualification for the Olympic Games of Rome, 1960. Together with Víctor Fragola, he entered the Star class.

At 17 years and 19 days, Caird remains, as of 2017, the youngest individual track event gold medalist at the Olympics. The 80 m hurdles favorites in Mexico were Caird’s older teammate Pam Kilborn, who had not lost since the 1964 Olympics in which she was the bronze medalist, and the 1964 Olympic champion and 1966 European champion East German Karin Balzer, but they both started poorly in the final. Balzer never recovered and finished fifth, while Kilborn came on strong at the end and almost caught her teammate Caird at the finish line, settling for silver. After 1968 Olympics, the 80 hurdles was replaced by the 100 metre hurdles and in this new event, Caird won silver at the 1970 Commonwealth Games behind Kilborn. Caird attempted to defend her Olympic title, but did not get past the heats in 1972. Caird won three Australian titles during her short career, in the 100 m hurdles in 1970 and 200 m hurdles in 1970-71.

178,Demetrius Casdagli,Male,10 October 1872,,, Greece,GRE,"Demetrius Casdagli was the older brother of the more famous Xenophon Casdagli, a well-known tennis player who earned a silver and bronze medal in the men’s and mixed doubles respectively at the 1906 Intercalated Games. The lesser-known Demetrius, however, had taken silver in the men’s singles and doubles at the inaugural Olympics, the latter with Dimitrios Petrokokkinos. Demetrius also participated in the 1906 Intercalated Games, contesting the mixed doubles with Fronietta Paspati, but the duo was defeated in the opening round by eventual silver medalists Sofia Marinou and Georgios Simiriotis. By career he ran the Egyptian arm of his father’s Manchester-based cotton business from 1895 until his death in 1931. His divorce from his wife Jeanne in 1917 became the basis of a landmark case in English law about whether an Englishman could acquire domicile in Egypt after 1914 (it was ruled ultimately that he could). The issue of Casdagli’s nationality is a source of frustration for those seeking to place early Olympic competitors into simple categories of identity. Until 2008, little was known about this athlete other than his relationship to Xenophon and his residency in Egypt, and he was listed in most sources as “Dionysius Kasdaglis”. That year, relatives of the Olympian confirmed his true identity, as well as his British citizenship. The family, however, was of Russian origin and acquired their Greek names when Demetrius’ grandfather moved to Greece in the early 1800s. Demetrius’ father Emmanuel was born in Rhodes, but established a cotton business in Manchester in 1862, and his children were born in England. Further research, conducted by Olympic historian Paul Tchir in 2017, turned up the original files for Demetrius’ divorce, wherein his wife argued stringently that her husband was British and nothing else. This was the crux of the larger legal issue, as Demetrius was attempting (for legal rather than personal identity purposes) to claim himself as an Egyptian since 1914, when the British declared a protectorate over Egypt, which had been a legal (if nominal in recent decades) possession of the Ottoman Empire since 1517. In her writ, she noted “At the time of said marriage [1905] my family put forward the suggestion that the Respondent [Demetrius] should become a Greek subject which would have been an easy thing for him to do, but he steadfastly declined and has ever since declined to abandon his British nationality.” The 1896 entry lists and the 1906 Official Report both list Casdagli as Greek and thus we have chosen to list him as such, which is consistent with the IOC database for 1896. The evidence indicates, however, that at the time of both tournaments he had no legal standing as a Greek national and would have been more properly classified as British.",Brother of Xenophon Casdagli

His cycling successes were limited, but in 1909 he had the honour of winning the first un-paced 50-mile time trial in Scotland, in a time of 2-42.0. He competed in the 1912 Stockholm Olympics in the individual and team road race, finishing fourth as part of the Scottish team in the latter. In 1907 he walked non-stop from Glasgow to Carlisle and in 1911 cycled from Land’s End to John o’ Groats. He once set a record of 8-55.0 for the Glasgow-Dumfries-Glasgow round trip on a bike. Miller was responsible for getting the Vegetarian Cycling Club started in Scotland, following its formation in London in 1888. After his racing days, Miller became a cycle builder in Scotland before moving to Essex in the 1930s, where he carried on the business at Romford. He accumulated a collection of over 60 famous and antique cycles that he kept after he sold his shop in 1948. Included in his collection was an 1818 hobby horse with solid iron wheels that was built for the sixth Duke of Argyll and was ridden by Miller in the film Great Expectations. An 1897 Tenby-built cycle from his collection was ridden by actor John Mills in the 1949 film The History of Mr Polly. Miller regularly displayed his collection and was often seen riding one of his penny-farthings at shows and exhibitions around Britain. He was well known for his magnificent beard, reminiscent of cricketer W. G. Grace and, because of his appearance, Miller received offers to appear in movies of his own, once playing the part of a Highland Chief in the film Bonnie Prince Charlie.

Before the 1972 Olympics, however, Spitz became undoubtedly the world’s greatest swimmer, and considered by many the greatest ever. In 1971 he became the first swimmer to win four individual AAU titles at one meet, setting three world records in the process. The next week, at a meet in East Germany, he won all four events again, this time breaking all four world records. The performance made him an overwhelming choice for the 1971 Sullivan Award. At the 1972 Olympics, Spitz set an Olympic record by winning seven gold medals, all of them in world-record time, the seven gold medals broken only in 2008 by Michael Phelps. Overall, he won 24 AAU championships, eight NCAA titles (while at Indiana University), and set 32 world records. After the 1972 Olympics he capitalized on his fame through various commercial interests, and invested heavily in California real estate. He returned to competition in 1991 with the aim of making the Olympic team the following year but, as he was over 40 years of age, it was a forlorn hope and an unfortunate end to a career of unrivaled achievements.","Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the Summer Pan American Games (5–0–0 1967 Winnipeg SWI gold: 100 m butterfly, 200 m butterfly, 4×100 m freestyle relay, 4×200 m freestyle relay, and 4×100 m medley relay) Listed in Olympians Who Set a World Record in Long Course Swimming (100 m freestyle – 23 August 1970 - 21 June 1975: 51.94 (23 August 1970; Los Angeles, USA), 51.47 (5 August 1972; Chicago, USA), 51.22 (3 September 1972; München, FRG); 200 m freestyle – 12 July 1969 - 23 August 1974: 1:54.3 tied (12 July 1969; Santa Clara, USA), 1:54.2 (4 September 1971; Leipzig, GDR), 1:53.5 (10 September 1971; Minsk, URS), 1:52.78 (29 August 1972; München, FRG); 400 m freestyle – 25 June 1967 - 4 July 1967, 7 July 1967 - 28 August 1967, and 23 June 1968 - 1 August 1968: 4:10.6 (25 June 1967; Haywood, USA), 4:08.8 (7 July 1967; Santa Clara, USA), 4:07.7 (23 June 1968; Haywood, USA); 100 m butterfly – 31 July 1967 - 27 August 1977: 56.3 (31 July 1967; Winnipeg, CAN), 55.7 (7 October 1967; West-Berlin, FRG), 55.6 (30 August 1968; Long Beach, USA), 55.0 (25 August 1971; Houston, USA), 54.72 (4 August 1972; Chicago, USA), 54.56 (4 August 1972; Chicago, USA), 54.27 (31 August 1972; München, FRG); 200 m butterfly – 26 July 1967 - 30 August 1967, 8 October 1967 - 22 August 1970, 27 August 1971 - 31 August 1971, and 2 August 1972 - 3 June 1976: 2:06.4 (26 July 1967; Winnipeg, CAN), 2:05.7 (8 October 1967; West-Berlin, FRG), 2:05.4 (22 August 1970; Los Angeles, USA), 2:03.9 (27 August 1971; Houston, USA), 2:01.87 (2 August 1972; Chicago, USA), 2:01.53 (2 August 1972; Chicago, USA), 2:00.70 (28 August 1972; München, FRG); 4×100 m freestyle relay – 17 October 1968 - 23 August 1970 and 28 August 1972 - 1 September 1974: 3:31.7 (17 October 1968; Ciudad de México, MEX), 3:26.42 (28 August 1972; München, FRG); 4×200 m freestyle relay – 10 September 1971 - 7 September 1973: 7:43.3 (10 September 1971; Minsk, URS), 7:35.78 (31 August 1972; München, FRG); 4×100 m medley relay – 3 September 1971 - 22 July 1976: 3:50.4 (3 September 1971; Leipzig, GDR), 3:48.16 (4 September 1972; München, FRG)) Listed in Olympic Swimmers - Doubles Champions, Same Year (1972 100/200 Freestyle Champion and 100/200 Butterfly Champion.)

He was the first athlete to use the Petrov/Bubka technique, partly named for his coach, which allowed him to grip the pole higher than most vaulters. Bubka first competed internationally as a senior at the 1983 World Championships, where he emerged victorious. He went on to win five more World titles in 1987, 1991, 1993, 1995 and 1997.

After missing the 1984 Games due to the Soviet boycott and placing second in the pole vault at the Friendship Games, Bubka won an expected gold medal in Seoul in 1988. In Barcelona in 1992, however, Bubka was one of the Games’ major disappointments, missing his starting height in the final. Injury prevented him from competing in Atlanta, and at the Sydney Games in 2000, by then past his prime, he was eliminated in qualification. Bubka won numeous other titles, including the World Indoors in 1985, 1987, 1991 and 1995; the 1986 European title; the 1985, 1987, 1991 and 1995 European Indoors; the 1986 Goodwill Games; the 1985 World Cup; the 1985 European Cup; and the 1985 and 1997 Grand Prix finals. He also broke the world record 28 times (17 outdoor, 11 indoor), usually bettering it by just a centimetre, as he collected bonus money for each improvement. He broke his first world record in May 1984 (5.85) and was the first vaulter to clear 6 metres in June 1985, in Paris; and 20 feet (6.10) in August 1991 in Malmö, Sweden. Bubka set his final world record of 6.15 in February 1993 in Donetsk which stood almost 21 years. Bubka retired from athletics in 2001 and then embarked on a career in sports administration and politics. Already a member of the IOC Athlete’s Commission, he became president of the Ukrainian NOC and a full member of the IOC in 2005. In 2013, he ran for IOC President, but lost out to Thomas Bach. Bubka was the IOC Executive Board athletes’ representative from 2000-07 and from 2012-20 was a member of the Executive Board. Since 2001, Bubka has been an IAAF council member and in 2011 was elected as an IAAF vice-president. From 2002-06, Bubka served in the Ukrainian parliament and on its Committee on youth policy, physical culture, sport and tourism.

Cartonnet moved to Neuilly-sur-Seine in April 1944, but still held the same government positions. At the liberation of France he fled the country for Sigmaringen, Baden-Württemberg in Germany.

However she left the pool in tears having failed even to reach the final of the 800 freestyle. She started 2008 by setting a new British 800 metre record at the Olympic trials and arrived at Beijing as one of the favourites for that event. The events of the Olympic 400 free were wholly unexpected however. After qualifying second for the final, Adlington was still a distant fifth as the field approached the final turn but put in a sprint finish that overhauled leader Katie Hoff of the USA in the closing few metres and she became the first female British Olympic swimming champion since Anita Lonsbrough in 1960. Even more impressive was her swim in the 800 freestyle where she broke Janet Evans’ longest standing world record on her way to her second gold of the Games. This was the first time for a century that a British swimmer had won more than one gold medal at an Olympic Games, when Henry Taylor won two golds in 1908. In the aftermath of her new found celebrity Adlington struggled to cope and her performances dipped in 2009 when she left the World Championships with only a pair of bronze medals. She posted a mixed set of results at the 2010 European Championships where, after finishing way back in seventh in her favoured 800 metres, she returned to her best form by winning the 400. This seemed to rekindle her career and, after winning the 400/800 double at the Commonwealth Games, she took her first world long course title when she won the 800 freestyle in 2011. Unfortunately, on home soil at the 2012 Olympics, she could not repeat her Beijing exploits and only returned with two bronze medals. Between 2008-11, Adlington won six ASA titles at 200, 400 and 800 metres freestyle. Swimming competitively since the age of nine, she was awarded the OBE in 2009 when aged just 20. She retired in February 2013 and set up her “Rebecca Adlington Swim Stars” programme aimed at helping youngsters take up swimming.

By the 1910s he had become involved in yacht racing and joined the Royal Vancouver Yacht Club, where he served as Commodore in 1924. In 1932 he was the helmsman of the Santa Maria, which represent Canada in the 8 metre class at that year’s Summer Olympics, with a crew consisting of Ernest Cribb, Peter Gordon, George Gyles, Harry Jones, and Hubert Wallace. Despite losing all four races, the Canadians brought home a silver medal from the Games because the only other nation to enter the 8 metre tournament was the United States. Maitland’s career as a businessman began in 1904, when he left his job as a clerk at the Royal Bank of Canada and was hired by Macaulay Nicolls, a real estate and insurance firm that eventually became part of Colliers International. He became a partner in the early 1920s and is credited with helping the firm survive the Great Depression. He was also involved in the operation of the North Arm Steamship Company in the early 1910s.

A year earlier they had skated to a 10th place finish at the 1928 Winter Olympics. In addition they attended the 1928 World Championships and placed 6th, and had not improved their performance two years later when they ranked 7th at the same tournament. The duo had no more success in 1932, placing 7th in their final world championship, and did not reach the Canadian national podium again until 1933, when they were again runners-up. They had a third-place finish at the 1934 Canadian Championships before retiring from the sport. Smith married Bud McDougald, who eventually rose to be the manager of operations at Canada’s wealthy Argus Corporation. At his death in 1978 he was worth an estimated 936 million in 2007 Canadian dollars. After his death she would soon be propelled once more into the national spotlight, this time for having her shares in the Argus Corporation taken by a young Conrad Black. Convinced by Black that McDougald’s successor Max Meighen would be problematic for the company, Smith, her sister Cecil, and her sister-in-law Doris Phillips gave him permission to remove Meighen from the company and later sold him their shares, which effectively maneuvered Black into the position of chairman of the company. Smith lived in a luxurious estate in Toronto, which was designated as a historical site by the city in 2001, with the remainder of her assets until her 1996 death.",Sister of Cecil Smith

He served in the military during the 1940s, eventually being promoted to lieutenant in 1943, and finally to first lieutenant of the infantry by 1948. It was during this time that he met his wife, Alice Trüssel, and settled into a home with her in a suburb of Bern not too far from his parents. Jenzer apprenticed to become a druggist and clerk, attending schooling in Neuchâtel/Neuenberg. He eventually worked for over 30 years for Paul Eggimann AG in Thalwil, a chemical and pharmaceutical products company, during which time he traveled frequently around the country. Jenzer was an active and founding member of the Berner Field Hockey Club, and one of the driving forces behind its inaugural meeting in July 1945, serving briefly as its president while in his early 20s and then as its treasurer. He was the club’s sole representative on the national team which competed at the 1948 Olympic Games in London; traveling by train to France then by ship to England, Jenzer would eventually play in two matches. The first was a tie against Afghanistan where he unfortunately missed a chance to score, with a moment too long of hesitation. He also played in the next match against the USA, a 3-1 victory for the Swiss team. Jenzer retired from the sport in 1951 after the birth of his son, but remained active in field hockey circles. He founded the junior section of the Berner Hockey Club in 1955, and was made an honourary member of the Berner Hockey Club in 1959. He also was president of the Swiss Field Hockey Association’s technical commission from 1967 to 1972. Later in life, Jenzer became an avid golfer along with his son, playing at over 350 different courses around the world.
