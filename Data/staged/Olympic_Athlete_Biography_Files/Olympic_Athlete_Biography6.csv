He initially devoted himself to painting, before creating his first sculptures in 1898. In 1902 he went to Leipzig and lived in Berlin since 1904, where he gave up painting. He became a member of the Berlin Secession in 1905, and was made a Board Member in 1911. Even before World War I Kolbe was one of the best German sculptors and the first scholarship holder at the Villa Romana in Firenze. In 1914 he switched to the Free Secession becoming its president in 1919. After the war, in which he participated as a volunteer, his sculptures became more and more influenced by expressionism. In 1918 he was appointed as a professor and in the following year was made a member of the Prussian Academy of Arts. Even before 1933 he was warned about the Nazis, although they considered some of his sculptures as paradigms of an Aryan man. Some of his works were removed, others remained, yet he still received further orders. In 1934, Kolbe signed the “Call of Cultural Workers” in favor of Adolf Hitler and regularly attended the Great German art exhibition at the Deutsches Haus in München. He also created two statues for the Reich Sports Field for the 1936 Berlin Olympics. However, Kolbe was not ready to tackle the monumentalism Hitler proposed, as Arno Breker did. However, in 1944 Hitler placed him on the list of the 12 most important German visual artists, although he never adopted Nazi politics. Overall, Kolbe created over 1,000 sculptures. In Berlin-Charlottenburg, a museum was installed in 1950 in his house and atelier with some of his sculptures exhibited in the garden, in what was the first museum founded in Berlin after World War II. In 2013-14 an exhibition by one of his closest friends, Renée Sintenis, was held in this museum. The 130 cm high plaster model of the Standing Woman, in the catalog raisonné called Young Woman, was created in 1926. It is now part of the Kolbe Museum. Copies of the approximately 10 bronze casts are available, for instance, at the Walker Art Center Minneapolis and at the Von der Heydt Museum Wuppertal. One copy was destroyed in 1943 in Kolbe’s garden by a bomb. The work Boys wrestling could be identical with the 52 cm high bronze Scherzo, which dates back to 1908.

He was a member of a family of the Tourquennoise industrial bourgeoisie, which had several good artists. Roussel studied at Stanislas College in Paris, where he learned the works of Bach, Beethoven, and Mozart. Following his love of the sea, he was admitted to the Naval Academy in 1887 and then served in the Navy until 1894, after which he devoted his life to music. Roussel studied in Paris with Eugène Gigout and enrolled in the Schola Cantorum in 1898, finishing his studies at the age of 38. He taught counterpoint and fugue between 1902-13, mentoring numerous students. As a former Naval officer, he returned to the service at age 45 during World War I. After the War, his influence on young musicians was considered of paramount importance. Among his students he counted Olympians like Jaroslav Křička and Knudåge Riisager. His music was defined by refined harmonies, rhythmic audacity, and the richness of color. He produced melodies, chamber music, various pieces for piano, two concerts (for piano and for cello), four symphonies (the third, in G minor, is considered one of his masterpieces, written to celebrate the 50th anniversary oft he Boston Symphony Orchestra) and the ballets “Le Festin de l’araignee” and “Bacchus et Ariane et Aeneas”. His opera-ballet „Padmâvati“ was inspired by his honeymoon in India. Roussel was prominent enough to be selected as a judge for he 1924 art competitions. After his death from a heart attack, Roussel was buried in the small marine cemetery of Varengeville-sur-Mer, where his tomb bears the following inscription, “It is in front of the sea that we will end our lives and that we will go to sleep to hear his eternal murmur still in the distance … (Albert Roussel).” A portrait of him by Claude-René Martin hangs in the library-museum of the Paris Opera houses. In 1969 the French Post Office issued a postage stamp bearing Roussel’s likeness.",

A week later he won the Staffordshire 220 title and knocked six seconds of the championship record in the process. Leivers went on to become one of the great distance swimmers in the 1930s, and the decade was dominated by two men, Leivers and Norman Wainwright, also from Stoke-on-Trent. They dominated the 440 and 880 ASA Championships in that period and between 1932-39 won seven of the eight 880 yards titles. In total, Leivers won nine ASA titles, but it was on the international scene that he enjoyed his greatest moments. Leivers competed at two Olympics Games, Los Angeles in 1932 and Berlin in 1936. He competed in seven events and reached six finals, with a fifth place finish in the 1932 4x200 freestyle relay, with Joseph Whiteside, Mickey Ffrench-Williams and Reg Sutton, being his best result. He reached both the 400 and 1500 individual finals in 1936. Having won the silver medal at the 1934 British Empire Games in the 4x200 free relay, Leivers went on to enjoy his most successful year in 1938 when, in addition to winning the National One Mile Championship, he won two golds at the British Empire Games in Sydney. He captured gold in the 1650 yards freestyle, and 4x220 relay with Freddie Dove, Ffrench-Williams and Wainwright. Leivers also won a silver in the 440 yards.

Although born in Lancashire, he was brought up in Sheffield by his mother after his father died after contracting a disease in east Africa during World War I. The family had very little money, and when Hill was selected for the 1936 Olympics he did not have the money for his rail fare to London where he met up with his pursuit teammates, so he cycled to the Capital. Once in Berlin, the four men won a bronze medal and, on arriving home in London, the Olympic medalist faced the prospect of riding back to Sheffield on the cycle he had won his medal on. However, after 30 miles he flagged down a passing lorry and the driver took Hill all the way to his front door. Runner-up to Ernie Mills in the tandem-paced 50-mile National Championship at Herne Hill in 1937, it was Hill’s first appearance in the event and, while Mills set a new record, Hill was also inside the old mark. Also in 1937, Hill attacked the world one hour record at the Vigorelli Velodrome in Milan and became the first man to break 25 miles (40.23 km) on an outdoor track. His final distance was 27 miles 1,134 yards (44.49 km). Hill turned professional in June 1938 and broke the British professional one-hour record in 1939. He was selected for the sprint at the World Championships that year. They were being held at the same Milano velodrome where Hill set his record two years earlier. The team travelled to Italy at the end of August, but were promptly recalled to London with the threat of war looming. The velodrome was subsequently bombed during the conflict. During the war, Hill was moved to Barrow where he helped build submarines. After the hostilities ended, he opened a garage near Manchester, but kept on cycling and was proud that he rode every day of his life from the age of 13, when he got his first bike, until receiving a broken hip in an accident in Spain in 2002. Upon his retirement at the age of 65, Hill visited relatives in North America and spent five weeks riding the 2,500 miles from New York to Vancouver and back. At the age of 80 he covered 23.5 miles on the local velodrome, just one and a half miles short of the distance he covered when he set his world record at the age of 21. The Harry Hill Cycleway in Bury, Greater Manchester, was opened in the Olympian’s honour in 2006.",

In the final, Hillyard and Doherty faced Josiah Ritchie, the new Olympic singles champion, and James Parke, who had won 20 caps for Ireland at rugby. After their scare in the semi-finals, Hillyard and Doherty were relieved to take the gold medals in straight sets. At the time of his Olympic victory, Hillyard was 44 years old and had been married to Blanche Bingley, six-times winner of the Wimbledon singles, for 21 years. He was in the second year of his 17-year tenure as the Secretary of the All-England Club and his best playing years were already behind him. He had won the English covered courts doubles in 1890 and 1891 with Harry Scrivener and again in 1904 and 1905 with Laurie Doherty as his partner. Hillyard’s outstanding achievement outdoors was to win the German Championship in 1897 and 1898 when this was still one of the major international tournaments. As a young man, George Hillyard spent some time in the navy and served on the same ship as the Price of Wales. He developed a close personal friendship with the future King George V, the basis on which the still surviving interest of the Royal family in lawn tennis is founded. Upon the outbreak of war, Hillyard rejoined the Navy and rose to the rank of Commander. Hillyard also excelled as a golfer and in 1903 he defeated Harry Hilton, the Open champion of 1892 and 1897 and the reigning amateur champion.

891663,Albert Walters,Male,3 April 1870,,, Great Britain,GBR,"A member of the Polytechnic CC, Albert Walters started racing in 1892 and his first major distance race was a 12-hour race at Herne Hill in 1894 for the Anchor Shield, which he won ahead of Arthur Chase, with a new record of just over 415 km (258 miles). Known as, “Jenny”, Walters’ biggest victory of his career was in winning the coveted Bol d’Or 24-hour endurance race in Paris in 1899. His winning distance of 1,020.977 km (634.41 miles) was a then world record even though he was motor paced. Also in 1899, he won the Paris-Dijon, was second in the European professional motor-paced race, and won the Berlin 6-day race, which took his season’s winnings to beyond £1,000. The following year, when the 24-hour race formed part of the Olympic Programme, albeit as a non-medal event, Walters looked certain to retain his title and led from the start until the 20-hour mark when a knee injury and exhaustion forced him to retire, and he was eventually classified sixth behind the Dutch winner, Matthieu Cordang. Before losing the lead, Walters set a new world record for every hour from three to 19. Five days earlier, Walters came second in the 100-mile race. He raced mostly on the continent at the turn of the century, because there was so little professional cycling in Britain at the time. A very popular rider, he also designed bicycles and invested his winnings wisely in a flourishing London tailor’s business.",

15632,Eddy Merckx,Male,17 June 1945,182.0,74, Belgium,BEL,"Eddy Merckx is considered the greatest cyclist of all-time, and few argue with that assessment. He was so strong and rode hard so often that his nickname was “The Cannibal”. He had no weaknesses – he was the strongest time trialist and climber in the world, and could outsprint all but a few rivals. Although his list of major victories is impressive, it is almost more impressive when one considers the records he holds for victories in major races. At his retirement he had won the most titles, or equal most, in the Tour de France (5), Giro d’Italia (5), World Championship road race (3), Milano-Sanremo (7), Gent-Wevelgem (3), La Flèche Wallonne (3), and Liège-Bastogne-Liège (5), and in that list, only Merckx’s five Tour de France wins has been surpassed, intially by Lance Armstrong, with seven, prior to his doping disqualifications. Merckx won 19 monument races, the five greatest one-day classics, a record, with second on that list Roger De Vlaeminck, far back with 11. He is one of only three riders, with De Vlaeminck and Rik Van Looy, to have won all five of the monuments. Merckx’s seven victories at Milano-Sanremo is an absolute record for most victories at any major one-day classic. Merckx was the first man (and since equalled only by Stephen Roche) to win the Tour de France, Giro d’Italia and World Professional Road Race in the same year (1974). Only he, Jacques Anquetil, Felice Gimondi, Bernard Hinault, Alberto Contador, and Chris Froome have ever won all three of the grand tours – Tour de France, Giro d’Italia, and the Vuelta à España, but only Merckx won at the other major tour, the Tour de Suisse. At the 1969 Tour de France, Merckx performed the still unequalled feat of winning the yellow jersey (overall winner), green jersey (points winner), and polka-dot jersey (King of the Mountains), something that could not even be imagined today in the professional peloton. His 11 victories in the major tours is an all-time record and might have been greater. He rode the Tour de France only eight times, twice when past his prime, and in 1973, because he was so dominant, he was asked by Tour organizers not to race because they felt his dominance was ruining the Tour. Merckx is credited with over 500 major professional wins during his career. His grand tour wins were as follows: 1969-72, 1974 Tour de France; 1968, 1970, 1972-74 Giro d’Italia; 1973 Vuelta à España; and the 1974 Tour de Suisse. He also won the following other jerseys in grand tours: mountain classification – 1969-70 Tour de France; 1968 Giro d’Italia; points classification – 1969, 1971-72 Tour de France; 1968, 1973 Giro d’Italia; and the 1973 Vuelta à España. Merckx’s three victories in the World Professional Road Race came in 1967, 1971, 1974, but he also won the World Amateur Championship on the road in 1964. In 1972, he set the World Hour Record, recording 49.431 km (30.722 miles) in Mexico City. That mark was broken in 1984 by Francesco Moser, but by then new bike technology had taken over, and subsequent hour marks were often due to improved bike design as much as the riders’ abilities. The UCI eventually reverted to a “standard” bike classification, and with that new classification, Merckx’s hour record was not bettered until 2000, and then by Chris Boardman riding only 10 metres further. In other lesser tours and one-day classics, Merckx’s victories can be summarized as follows: Milano-Sanremo – 1966-67, 1969, 1971-72, 1975-76; La Flèche Wallonne – 1967, 1970, 1972; Gent-Wevelgem – 1967, 1970, 1973; Paris-Roubaix – 1968, 1970, 1973; Liège-Bastogne-Liège – 1969, 1971-73, 1975; Ronde van Vlaanderen – 1969, 1975; Paris-Nice – 1969-71; Dauphiné-Libéré – 1971; Midi-Libre – 1971; Het Volk – 1971, 1973; Giro di Lombardia – 1971-72; Paris-Brussels – 1973; Grand Prix des Nations – 1973; Amstel Gold Race – 1973, 1975. Merckx was not without his detractors. He was criticized by other riders because he never let up, always riding to win, often not giving lesser riders a chance to shine a bit. And he tested positive for drugs three times, in an era in which the doping penalties were less stringent. In retirement, though, he remains the all-time Belgian sporting legend, being voted Belgium’s Sportsman of the 20th Century, and he was made a Baron by Albert II, King of Belgium in 1996. Merckx’s son, Axel, later became a professional cyclist, though not with the success of his father, although he did win a bronze medal in the Olympic road race in 2004.","Father of Axel Merckx Grandfather of Luca Masso Listed in Olympian Members of the Nobility (Baron) Listed in Olympians Who Were Elected Belgian Athlete of the Year (1969, 1970, 1971, 1972, 1973, 1974) Listed in Olympic Order Recipients (1995 (Silver))"

46268,Ragnhild Hveger,Female,10 December 1920,,, Denmark,DEN,"Ragnhild Hveger was considered as the “female Johnny Weissmuller” and as “the most extraordinary swimmer ever” by many swimming historians. Unlike Weissmuller, she did not get much media attention, because her prime was during World War II. Born to the family of a train pilot, who had strong ties with the Danish National Socialist Workers Party, she took up competitive swimming in 1932 at the age of 12 and made her international début at the 1936 Olympics, where she won silver in the 400 m freestyle, at age 15. Hveger next competed at the 1938 European Championships in London, where she won golds in the 100 and 400 freestyles and 4x100 free relay and was nicknamed as “The Golden Torpedo” by The Times after winning the 400 m freestyle event by nearly half the pool’s length, beating runner-up Dutch Rie van Veen by nearly 20 seconds. Hveger’s best years were during World War II. Between 1936-43 she set 44 world records, mostly in freestyle, in distances between 200 to 1500, but also one in the 200 m backstroke, and in 1941 alone, she set 19 world records. However, the later part of her career was marred by her family’s close association with the Nazis. Her father had risen to a high rank in the Danish National Socialist Workers Party and her brother was a volunteer with the Waffen SS fighting on the Eastern Front. Her popularity was often used as a propaganda tool by the Nazis, which resulted in her marrying a German officer in 1943, retirement from sports, and moving to Kiel to work as a swimming instructor. After the war, her popularity had declined so much that Hveger had to work as a swimming instructor in Sweden and only returned to Denmark in 1948 with the intention of competing at the 1948 Olympics. But Danish Olympic Committee put her amateur status in question, referring to her work as a swimming instructor and put her on a two-year probation to restore her amateur status. Thus, Hveger competed at her second Olympics only in 1952, where she led the 400 m freestyle final thru 300 metres, but finished only fifth. She also helped the Danish 4x100 m relay team to a fourth place finish. Hveger finally retired from competitive swimming in 1954, all her world records still unbroken, and later led a secluded life, very rarely making public appearances and giving interviews. Hveger was elected to the International Swimming Hall of Fame (ISHOF) in 1966 and in 1996 was named Danish female athlete of the 20th century by the Danish Olympic Committee. In 1999 she was named one of the top 10 swimmers of the 20th century, either male or female, by Swimming World magazine. The other nine selected had won 29 Olympic gold medals between them, while Hveger was the only one with none.","Listed in Olympians Who Set a European Record in Long Course Swimming (200 m freestyle – 11 September 1938 - 1 May 1957: 2:21.7 (11 September 1938; Århus, DEN); 400 m freestyle – 10 February 1937 - 16 November 1956: 5:14.2 (10 February 1937; København, DEN), 5:14.0 (3 October 1937; Gent, BEL), 5:12.4 (14 November 1937; Magdeburg, GER), 5:11.0 (12 December 1937; København, DEN), 5:08.2 (16 January 1938; København, DEN), 5:06.1 (1 August 1938; København, DEN), 5:05.4 (8 September 1940; Svendborg, DEN), 5:00.1 (15 September 1940; København, DEN); 800 m freestyle – 3 July 1936 - 28 June 1953: 11:11.7 (3 July 1936; København, DEN), 10:52.5 (13 August 1941; København, DEN); 1500 m freestyle – 3 July 1938 - 23 July 1955: 21:45.7 (3 July 1938; Helsingor, DEN), 21:10.1 (11 August 1940; Helsingor, DEN), 20:57.0 (20 August 1941; København, DEN); 200 m backstroke – 14 February 1937 - 17 April 1938: 2:41.3 (14 February 1937; Århus, DEN); 4×100 m freestyle relay – 8 February 1938 - 27 April 1952: 4:29.7 (8 February 1938; København, DEN), 4:27.6 (7 August 1938; København, DEN)) Listed in Olympians Who Set a World Record in Long Course Swimming (200 m freestyle – 11 September 1938 - 25 February 1956: 2:21.7 (11 September 1938; Aarhus, DEN); 400 m freestyle – 10 February 1937 - 25 August 1956: 5:14.2 (10 February 1937; København, DEN), 5:14.0 (3 October 1937; Ghent, BEL), 5:12.4 (14 November 1937; Magdeburg, GER), 5:11.0 (12 December 1937; København, DEN), 5:08.2 (16 January 1938; København, DEN), 5:06.1 (1 August 1938; København, DEN), 5:05.4 (8 September 1940; Svendborg, DEN), 5:00.1 (15 September 1940; København, DEN); 800 m freestyle – 3 July 1936 - 28 June 1953: 11:11.7 (3 July 1936; København, DEN), 10:52.5 (13 August 1941; København, DEN); 1500 m freestyle – 3 July 1938 - 23 July 1955: 21:45.7 (3 July 1938; Helsinki, FIN), 21:10.1 (11 August 1940; Helsinki, FIN), 20:57.0 (20 August 1941; København, DEN); 200 m backstroke – 14 February 1937 - 17 April 1938: 2:41.3 (14 February 1937; Århus, DEN); 4×100 m freestyle relay – 8 February 1938 - 27 April 1952: 4:29.7 (8 February 1938; København, DEN), 4:27.6 (7 August 1938; København, DEN)) Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the European Aquatics Championships (3–0–0 1938 London SWM gold: 100 m freestyle, 400 m freestyle, and 4×100 m freestyle relay)"

He also finished fifth and seventh in 4x100 and 4x200 metre freestyle relays respectively, and was eliminated in the opening rounds of the 100, 200, and 400 metre freestyle events. He again reached the podium the following year at the World Championships, with gold in the 100 m butterfly and bronze in the 4x100 m medley relay (with Ian MacKenzie, Brian Phillips, and the non-Olympian Peter Hrdlitschka). His best year, however, was 1974, when he won six medals at the Commonwealth Games: gold in the 4x100 metre freestyle and medley relays, silver in the 100 and 200 metre freestyle events, and bronze in the 100 metre butterfly and the 4x200 metre freestyle relay.

He was nominated as a travelling reserve for the 400m hurdles (not to compete unless one of the others was injured) and as a full member of the 4 × 400 metres relay team. He had a back strain before he left for Mexico which would have excluded him from the 400m hurdles but he cleared himself as fit for the 4 × 400 metres relay although he was not risked for the race. At the 1969 European Games in Greece Todd won bronze in the 400 metres hurdles with a time of 50.38 seconds.

Playing defense, he stayed with Litvinov until the 1991 season, shortly after which he was chosen by the Vancouver Canucks in the 2nd round of the NHL Entry Draft. He moved to North America in 1992 and mostly played in the NHL through the 2005-06 season before returning to the Czech Republic, playing his final five seasons with Litvinov. In the NHL Šlégr had an itinerant career, playing with the Vancouver Canucks, Edmonton Oilers, Pittsburgh Penguins, Detroit Red Wings, Atlanta Thrashers, and Boston Bruins. He also spent parts of a few seasons in the American Hockey League (AHL) with NHL farm clubs, the Hamilton Canucks and Cape Breton Oilers. But during various NHL work stoppages, Šlégr also returned to Europe to play, again with various teams, spending time in the Swedish league with Södertalje SK, the Russian league with Spartak Omsk, and the German Elite League with EHC Biel (Bienne), in addition to short stints with Litvinov in the Czech Republic. In the 2001-02 season, Šlégr was traded from Atlanta to the Red Wings late in the season, which enabled him to get his name on the Stanley Cup that year. Internationally Šlégr played for Czechoslovakia and the Czech Republic at multiple tournaments. He represented Czechoslovakia at the 1990-91 World Juniors, the 1991 World Championships, and the 1992 Winter Olympics and Canada Cup.

Šlégr is a member of the Triple Crown club, winning titles in the NHL, World Championships, and Olympics. Near the end of his hockey career Šlégr entered the political arena, being elected into the Czech Chamber of Deputies as a member of the Czech Social Democratic Party. Because of party loyalties, Šlégr left the Social Democrats in 2011 and founded a new party, the National Socialists – 21st Century Left. He left parliament in 2013, stating he was going back to the “clean environment among athletes.” Šlégr was the son of Jiří Bubla, who won a silver medal for Czechoslovakia at the 1976 Winter Olympics, multiple medals at the World Championships, and played in the NHL for four years with the Vancouver Canucks.

One of the first things he did was to help re-write the rules of the British version of the sport. Some people expressed public dissent at the way Morrell was trying to change the sport but, after getting Lord Mountevans, and other influential people, on his side, he published a new set of wrestling rules, which became known as the Admiral-Lord Mountevans Rules, and professional wrestling in Britain was to change.",

In 1929 Rowe won the British middle, light-heavy and heavyweight titles, and also appeared in the European Championships at Paris. Unfortunately, an ankle injury prevented him retaining his British titles in 1930. He went on to win four more titles, however, middleweight (1932-33) and light-heavyweight (1933-34). Rowe also reached the heavyweight final in 1932 but had to withdraw due to an injured arm and ear. A Nottingham City policeman, Rowe’s finest moment internationally came at the British Empire Games at London in 1934 when he won a light-heavyweight silver medal. Rowe’s brother Douglas was a footballer and played in the Football League with Luton Town, Lincoln City, and Southampton. He was also an excellent wrestler and was the 1931 British welterweight champion.",Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the British Empire/Commonwealth Games (0–1–0 1934 London WRE silver: freestyle light-heavyweight -87 kg (competed for England))

He played four years in the league, mostly with the Burn, retiring after the 2000 season. In 2000 he was also loaned out briefly to the Tennessee Rhythm and the Texas Rattlers. In 1999 Pollard had his best year in MLS, but in the play-offs was taken down on a vicious tackle by Demo Kovalenko that broke his leg. He returned in 2000 but was never the same player and retired shortly thereafter. Pollard stayed in Dallas where he met a woman 21 years his senior, they fell in love and married. She came from a family of beekeepers so together they started the Texas Honeybee Guild, and Pollard described himself as, “ I’m a fulltime educator. I just manifest my teaching through beekeeping.

While still at Sandhurst he made his début as a county cricketer for Somerset in 1911. He was commissioned into the Price Albert’s Somerset Light Infantry in 1912 but shortly after his 21st birthday resigned his commission and enrolled at St. Bartholomew’s Hospital with the intention of following his father as a doctor. The war soon interrupted his medical studies and after rejoining his regiment, MacBryan had the misfortune to be taken prisoner in France just three weeks after the outbreak of hostilities. After the war, MacBryan went up to Jesus College, Cambridge, and won a cricket blue in 1920. Although he also played hockey for Cambridge he was not selected for the match against Oxford. The 1920 Olympic Games was the only occasion that he played hockey at international level. Apart from his obvious cricket and hockey talents he was an accomplished golfer, playing to a handicap of four at Sunningdale and at Prince’s Club, Sandwich, and also played rugby for Richmond. MacBryan represented Somerset at all four sports but cricket was undoubtedly his main love. On leaving Cambridge, he served for two years as a private secretary to Sir Francis Towle but then took a job on the Stock Exchange which did not interfere with his cricketing summers. He was one of the mainstays of the Somerset team from 1911 to 1931 and in 1924 he played for England against South Africa at Old Trafford but, because of rain, little play was possible and MacBryan did not bat. However, the opportunity to show his batting talents to the South Africans was not long delayed and he went on the unofficial MCC tour that winter, playing in four of five “Tests”. He scored more than 1000 runs in a season five times, coming close to scoring 2000 in 1923, and in 1925 Wisden’s named him as one of the Cricketers of the Year. Sadly, Jack MacBryan’s good fortune as a sportsman did not embrace his whole life. His marriage to the Gaiety Girl, Myrna Thompson, was short-lived and in his old age he suffered from severe financial distress. After retiring from the stockbrokerage house for whom he had worked for many years he joined another firm which soon failed and MacBryan was faced with the tragedy of being “hammered” at the age of 80. He spent his last years in very modest circumstances in Cambridge and the Memorial Service held there one week after his death, on what would have been his 91st birthday, was attended by only 14 people.",Listed in Olympians Who Played First-Class Cricket (Played 1 Test match (England) and 206 First Class matches (Somerset))

His early work history saw him on the technical staff at the Ramo-Woolridge Corporation from 1957-58, then at the JPL, followed by serving as lab director at Plasmodyne Corporation from 1960-62 and a chief scientist at Curtiss-Wright Corporation from 1962-64. Gourdine founded Gourdine Laboratories in 1964, a research and development firm in Livingston, New Jersey, and later founded Energy Innovations in Houston, a company producing direct-energy conversion devices. He was considered a pioneer in the field of electrogas dynamics. Gourdine invented an engineering technique known as Incineraid to disperse smoke from buildings, which was later adapted to disperse fog from airports. Another of his inventions, Focus Flow Heat Sink, was used to cool computer chips. He was inducted into the Engineering and Science Hall of Fame in 1994 and became a member of the National Academy of Engineering in 1991. Gourdine was granted over 30 US patents and later became a Trustee of Cornell University. Personal Best: LJ – 7.81 (1951).",

67748,Lauri Pihkala,Male,5 January 1888,179.0,79, Finland,FIN,"Lauri Pihkala was a champion track and field athlete, an influential sports coach and writer, and the inventor of pesäpallo, the Finnish variant of baseball. Pihkala set multiple national records on the track and represented Finland at two Olympic Games. At the 1908 London Olympics Pihkala competed in the high jump, finishing in joint-16th place with 1.67 metres, and the discus, where the distance of his throw was not recorded. He was also scheduled to take part in the 400 metres, pole vault, and shot put, but did not start in those events. After the London Olympics, Pihkala switched his focus to the track, going on to win several national titles in the 200, 400, and 800 metres. His first Finnish title came in 1910 with victory in the 400 metres in a time of 52 seconds. Pihkala performed the triple in 1911 and 1912 when he won the 200, 400, and 800 metres in each year. As well as his national titles, Pihkala improved the Finnish record for the 400 metres on three occasions. He ran in the 800 metres at the 1912 Stockholm Olympics, but did not finish in his heat. Pihkala was also scheduled to run in the 400 metres in Stockholm but did not start the race. Pihkala made two trips to the United States, the first in 1908, and the second from 1912 to 1913, where he became familiar with modern coaching techniques. He published a guide to sports coaching and worked as an advisor to the Sports Association of the Kingdom of Finland. As a full-time coach, Pihkala toured Finland to give presentations, founded training clubs, and developed a badge system on sporting performance limits to encourage young people. Following Pihkala’s second visit to the United States he translated a book on baseball into Finnish. He believed that the American game would be too difficult to play in Finland, so he began to invent a variation of the sport. In the early 1920s pesäpallo was born, which drew elements not just from baseball, but from the Swedish bat-and-ball game brännboll, rounders, and the Russian bat-and-ball game lapta. Pesäpallo was played as a demonstration sport at the 1952 Helsinki Olympics by two Finnish teams representing the Finnish Baseball League and the Workers’ Athletic Federation.

He spent 15 seasons playing in Serie A with U.S. Avellino (1981-83), Juventus (1984-92) and finally with Genoa (1992-95). The highlights of his career were during his time with the “Bianconeri” (Black and Whites) of Juventus. With them he won the Italian League in 1984 and 1986, Italian Cup in 1990, and the European Cup in 1985 when Juve beat Liverpool at the Heysel Stadium, Bruxelles, in a match marred by the death of 39 people before the start of the game. Tacconi also won the UEFA Cup-winners’ Cup (1984), the UEFA Cup (1990), the European Super Cup (1984), and Intercontinental Cup (1985), During that period in the second half of the 1980s, Juventus was regarded as one of the best teams in the world, and Tacconi, one of the best ‘keepers. After nearly 10 years with Juventus, and 254 Serie A appearances, Tacconi moved to Genoa in 1992, but they were relegated to Serie B at the end of the season, and Tacconi eventually retired from professional football in the 1994/95 season. Despite his successes at Juventus, Tacconi was not able to find a regular place in the Italian international squad under coach Azeglio Vicini, because other excellent goalkeepers, such as Giovanni Galli, Walter Zenga, and the promising newcomer Gianluca Pagliuca, were all staking a claim for the No. 1 shot. Being around at the same time as such other notable goalkeepers, notably Zenga, Tacconi won just seven full caps, starting with a 3-1 win over Argentina in a friendly at Zürich in 1987. As coach to the 1988 Olympic squad, the 1982 World Cup-winning goalkeeper Dino Zoff chose Tacconi as the first choice ‘keeper for the qualifying matches, and at Seoul, he retained his place under the new manager Francesco Rocca. Tacconi and Mauro Tassotti were the only two members of the Italian squad to play in all six matches, for a total of 600 minutes, as Italy finished fourth.",

Throughout the late 1890s and early 1900s he began branching out his talents by winning competitions at the local, then national, and finally international level. His father and brother, both named John F., had made their names in Canada as boxers, and Lou tried his hand in this sport as well. He earned the title of Canadian heavyweight champion in 1902, but gave it up due to fears that he would damage his rowing abilities. By 1903 he was North American champion in the senior singles and doubles categories, the later alongside Frank Smith. His efforts culminated in his victory at the Diamond Challenge Sculls in England in July 1904, one of the oldest and most prestigious rowing events in the world, where he set a then-course record of 8 minutes, 23 seconds. He planned on defending his title in 1905, but was struck with typhoid fever and could not attend. He competed at the 1908 Summer Olympics in the single sculls event for Canada, but was eliminated in the second round. He retired from rowing in 1909 after winning that year’s Pacific Coast Championship in British Columbia. Outside of active competition Scholes was a member of the Queen’s Own Rifles Bugle Band and served with the 48th Highlanders and the 180th Sportsmen’s Battalion, although he did not travel overseas with them during World War I due to a broken leg. After his recovery he was appointed Director of Sports for Military Division #2 with the rank of captain, eventually serving in Siberia for six months as brigade transport officer with the Canadian Expeditionary Forces.

Winning the 2008 Olympic title, Team USA, led by Bryant, successfully defended at the 2012 Olympics by defeating Spain 107-100 for back-to-back golds. Bryant represented his country on five USA Basketball national teams and aided those teams to a 36-0 record (and the two Olympic gold medals). In 37 games played, he compiled 504 points (13.6 ppg), 86 rebounds (2.3 rpg) and 102 assists (2.8 apg). Right out of high school Bryant was selected 13th overall in the 1997 NBA Draft by the Charlotte Hornets, becoming the 27th player to jump from high school directly into the NBA. The Hornets traded him to the Los Angeles Lakers, where he played his entire 20-year career. He won five NBA championships (2000, 2001, 2002, 2009, 2010), was twice named NBA Finals MVP (2009, 2010) and was once named the NBA’s MVP (2008). He holds the NBA record for the most seasons playing with one franchise for an entire career. The NBA’s number three all-time scorer (as of 2019), twice Bryant was the NBA scoring champion (2006, 2007). He entered the league as the rookie who won the 1997 Slam Dunk Contest and fast became a fan favourite. He was an 18-time All-Star and a 15-time member of the All-NBA Team. Bryant’s high school career was played at Lower Merion High School in Pennsylvania, where he was recognized as the top high school basketball player in the country and named the 1996 Naismith Prep Player of the Year. His father Joe Bryant (aka Joseph Washington “Jellybean” Bryant) was a professional basketball player in the NBA with the Philadelphia 76ers, the San Diego Clippers and the Houston Rockets. Kobe spent eight years in Italy in the late 1980’s when his father was playing there, and spoke fluent Italian. Born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA, Bryant’s parents named him after the Kobe beef steak they had seen on a restaurant menu prior to his birth. His nickname “The Black Mamba” is a name he gave himself as a way to deal with the struggles he was going through on and off the court in 2003 and 2004. Bryant’s life was not without controversy. Most notably, in 2003, Bryant was scheduled to have surgery in Vail, Colorado at the Steadman-Hawkins Clinic. The night before his surgery he had a sexual encounter with a hotel employee, who later accused him of sexual assault. Bryant admitted to the sexual encounter but denied the allegations of sexual assault and the criminal charge was eventually dropped. The woman, however, filed a civil suit against Bryant, which was settled privately. A few years after his retirement from the NBA, Bryant’s name was in the headlines again when LeBron James surpassed him for career points scored in the NBA. That news was on the morning sports shows in the United States to be followed, only a few hours later, by the sad news that Kobe Bryant had died in a helicopter fire and crash.","Cousin of John Cox Listed in Olympians Who Won Academy Awards (Oscars) (Best Animated Short Film 2018 for ""Dear Basketball"" - Writer) Listed in Olympians Who Died in Aviation Crashes (Died in helicopter crash and fire, along with his daughter, Giana, and 7 other people.)

She served on Olympic and World Championship juries, and also managed the British ladies’ team at four Olympics. Having been a member of the Ladies’ Ski Club for more than 20 years, she served as president 1951-54, and from 1955 was a Great Britain representative on the International Ski Federation (ISF) ladies Alpine committee for more than 20 years.

Kolomenkin was fascinated by this new sport and soon became the top Russian figure skater at the turn of 20th century. But for fear of fellow student’s mocking him, Kolomenkin competed in figure skating under the pseudonym Nikolay Panin and used this name throughout his competitive figure skating career. In 1908 Kolomenkin became the first Russian Olympic winner when he won the special figures event at the London Olympics. Kolomenkin also won silver at the 1903 World Championships in singles, another silver at the 1908 European Championships, and bronze at the 1904 European Championships. He also won the Russian singles title from 1901-05 and 1907. While studying at university, Kolomenkin was an all-around athlete, competing in cycling, rowing, athletics, swimming, skiing and played football and hockey. After graduating university with a mathematics degree in 1898, Kolomenkin became a competent sports shooter, winning 23 Russian titles in pistol shooting (1906-17). He also competed at the 1912 Olympics as a shooter, finishing eighth in individual free pistol and fourth in team pistol. After winning his Olympic title, Kolomenkin retired from competitive figure skating and worked as a figure skating coach. From 1915-17 Kolomenkin was general secretary of the Russian Olympic Committee and from 1919-30 worked in various financial positions with the Petrograd (later Leningrad) province and oblast governments. From 1933 until his death, Kolomenkin worked as head of the figure skating department at the Lesgaft State Institute of Physical Culture (now Lesgaft National State University of Physical Education, Sport and Health).",Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the European Figure Skating Championships (0–1–1 1904 Davos bronze: singles; 1908 Warszawa silver: singles) Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the World Figure Skating Championships (0–1–0 1903 St. Petersburg silver: singles)

Alm developed a talent for skiing from an early age and was part of the national team that won the 60 kilometres cross-country race when he was 21. In 1922 Alm won the first edition of the Vasaloppet, an annual cross-country race held on the first Sunday of March in Sweden. His skiing club could not afford to send any competitors, but the newspaper Västerbottens-Kuriren were able to pay expenses for three members of IFK Norsjö to attend.

93860,Michael Phelps,Male,30 June 1985,193.0,91, United States,USA,"Michael Phelps’ performances at the 2004-16 Olympics have brought him strong consideration as the greatest ever Olympian. He has surpassed the records of Mark Spitz and Johnny Weissmuller and is considered the greatest swimmer ever. Phelps swims several strokes, including butterfly and freestyle, but his best events are the individual medleys. At the 2004 Olympic Games, Michael Phelps became only the second athlete, after Aleksandr Dityatin (URS-GYM-1980) to win eight medals at a single Olympics, and he repeated this in 2008 at Beijing. Phelps had attempted to win gold medals in eight swimming events in 2004, to better Mark Spitz’s performance at München. Phelps did not manage that but did win six gold medals (four individual) and two bronze medals. He followed this with a dominating performance at the 2005 World Championships at which he won five gold medals and a silver medal. He had also won five World Championship gold medals at the 2003 meet. Phelps not only did not stop competing but pushed his records even further. At the 2007 World Championships he entered eight events and won seven gold medals, losing out on the eighth in the 4×100 medley relay, when the USA was disqualified in an early round heat in which he had sat out. He seemed poised to challenge Spitz’s 1972 mark of seven gold medals. At Beijing Phelps again entered eight events and this time he came thru with a victory in all eight, becoming the first Olympian to win eight gold medals at one Olympic Games. After Beijing, Phelps took some time off and also had some problems with substance abuse and spent time in rehab. He did not train as hard for a time, but he still won five gold medals and six medals at the 2009 World Championships. He won another five golds at the 2010 Pan-Pacs, and in 2011, won four gold medals and seven medals at the Worlds, setting him up for the 2012 Olympics, and giving him a total of 33 medals and 26 gold medals at the World Championships. At London in 2012, Phelps cemented his title as the world’s greatest swimmer and, to many people, as the world’s greatest Olympian. He won four more gold medals and six medals, but actually failed to medal in one event in 2012, placing fourth in the 400 IM. His six medals in 2012 left him with absolute Olympic records of 22 medals and 18 gold medals.

15378,Jocelyn Lovell,Male,19 July 1950,179.0,71, Canada,CAN,"Considered one of Canada’s first cycling icons, Lovell, born in Norfolk, England, competed at three Olympic Games. He made the 1968 Olympic team in Mexico City while still a teenager and finished a respectable 7th in the 1,000m time trial. His arrival on the Canadian cycling scene and international success was greatly welcomed after a four decades medal drought in his country. His victory in the 10-mile scratch race at the 1970 Commonwealth Games in Edinburgh made him the first Canadian in 36 years to win a cycling gold. Lovell dominated the Canadian cycling scene in the 1970s and 1980s. He was three-times Commonwealth Games champion (on home soil in Edmonton in 1978), a 1978 World Championships silver medalist (1000 m time trial in Munich), a two-time Pan American Games champion (1971 and 1975 1000 m time trial), and won more than 35 national titles (on road and track, at every distance). Lovell was introduced to the sport by his brother Peer, who was at one time a Canadian champion as well. His successes were all the more remarkable because he trained himself, never working with a personal coach. His ability to cycle was tragically cut short in 1983 at the age of 33 while out on a training ride northwest of Toronto, when he was run over from behind by a dump truck and dragged over 1000 feet, leaving him a quadriplegic. With a reputation as a controversial and outspoken individual as a cyclist, Lovell emerged as a high-profile spokesman for the disabled after his accident. Lovell was married to three-time Olympic speed skater Sylvia Burka in 1981, who was also a competitive cyclist, separating in 1986. In 1975, Lovell received the Norton H. Crow Award, as the Canadian male amateur athlete of the year, and in 1985, he was inducted into Canada’s Sports Hall of Fame.","Husband (divorced) of Sylvia Burka Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the Summer Pan American Games (2–0–0 1971 Cali CYC gold: 1000 m track time trial; 1975 Ciudad de México CYC gold: 1000 m track time trial) Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the British Empire/Commonwealth Games (4–1–1 1970 Edinburgh CYC gold: 10 miles scratch, silver: tandem, bronze: 1000 m time trial; 1978 Edmonton CYC gold: 1000 m time trial, 10 miles scratch, and tandem)"

Kozakiewicz was European Indoor champion in 1977 and 1979, and at the outdoor Europeans, he placed second in 1974 and fourth in 1978, also winning the Universiade in 1977 and 1979. He was ranked in the world top 10 every year from 1973-82, and was ranked #1 in the world in 1975, 1977, 1979, and 1980. His Olympic title was won with a world record, his second of 1980, in front of a hostile Moskva (Moscow) crowd. After his winning jump, he saluted the crowd with an “up yours” gesture, later known in Poland as “Gest Kozakiewicza (Kozakiewicz’s Gesture)”, with the picture being shown virtually everywhere, including on the cover of Track & Field News. The Soviet ambassador to Poland, Boris Aristov, demanded that the IOC remove the gold medal because of this act, but nothing was done, and he was elected Polish Sportsman of the Year for 1980. In 1985 Kozakiewicz emigrated to West Germany, where he twice became German champion and worked as a pole vault coach. After the fall of Communism, Kozakiewicz eventually settled in his native Lithuania.

He was educated and brought up in Switzerland, where his father was a businessman. Not surprisingly, the young Sydney was a good skier from an early age, and was also a good quality tennis player and golfer. In the 1930s he shared his time between the ski slopes of Switzerland in the winter months and the Royal Eastbourne Golf Club in spring and summer, where he played off scratch. Hudson was runner-up in the Sussex Amateur Championship three times (1931-32, 1934), and in 1932 reached the fifth round of the British Open Amateur Championship. Around the same time, Hudson was also making a name for himself on the ski slopes at Mürren, alongside his future Great Britain team-mate Peter Lunn. Of the two, however, it was Hudson who was a British champion, winning both the downhill and combined in 1933. He made his Great Britain début in the 1934 International races at Sankt Moritz, and remained on the team until 1936, when he was vice-captain of the team at the Olympics. He won the coveted Kandahar Cup prior to the Garmisch-Partenkirchen Games. Hudson’s future wife Joan, who he married in 1938, was also a member of the British skiing team. Prior to the outbreak of World War II, Hudson won the 1939 Swiss Open Amateur Golf Championship. Shortly afterwards, he returned to England and was commissioned into the Royal Fusiliers, but soon became a Special Operation Executive (SOE), working with the French Resistance. He was arrested and sent to a camp near Toulouse but eventually escaped and made his way via Spain, to Gibraltar, and then back to England. He returned to France shortly afterwards and then saw service with the SOE in the Far East. Hudson rose to the rank of lieutenant-colonel and received a DSO with Bar, and was honoured with the French Croix de Guerre. In 1953 he joined the human resources division of Shell International, working in Trinidad and the United States, amongst other places. Rather than take up a post in Vietnam in 1969, he moved to Scotland and joined the Bank of Scotland, helping them with training and development. He was also a representative on the Scottish Council of the Confederation of British Industry (CBI), and later chairman of CBI Scotland. Hudson retired in 1980 but, following the formation of the new British political party, the Social Democratic Party (SDP), he played an active role in establishing the party in Scotland. Two years before his death, Hudson wrote a book entitled Undercover Operator, which told of his exploits with the SOE.",

She was a symbol of Italian volleyball for over a decade, as one of the greatest talents ever seen in national volleyball. An excellent spiker, strong both in receiving and attacking, with great ability and a flexible wrist, Piccinini advanced her career rapidly. She débuted in the First League with Pallavolo Carrarese on 7 November 1993 in a match against Olimpia Ravenna at only 14-years-old. After two seasons with the Tuscany club, she moved to Pallavolo Reggio Emilia (1995-96) and then to Volley Modena (1996-97). With this club she won the European SuperCup in 1996 and one Cup Winners’ Cup in 1997. After a year with Spezzano 2000 Volley and one in Brazil, where she was runner-up with the Rexona Paranà Volei Club, she returned in Italy and joined Volley Bergam. From 1999-2012 she won four Italian titles, two Italian Cups, the SuperCup three times, five European Cups and one Cup Winners’ Cup. In the following years she was with Duck Farm Chieri Volley Club and LJ Volley Modena, while in 2016 she won the SuperCup and European Cup with Casalmaggiore and was named best player. From 2016 until her September 2019 retirement, she was with AGIL Novara, where she again won the title and the SuperCup in 2017, two Italian Cups and the European Cup in 2018-19. Piccinni also joined the national team at a young age. In 1994, aged 15, she was a member of the silver medal-winning squad at the Junior Europeans, playing alongside girls three or four years older than her. In 1996 she won the Junior Europeans and, a year later, was second at the Worlds. She débuted with the senior team on 10 June 1995 at Vimercate (Milano) in a losing friendly match against the United States. Piccinni gradually became the lynchpin of the Italian team and collected more than 400 caps. She earned a historic gold medal at the 2002 FIVB World Championships in Germany with a team coached by Marco Bonitta, competed in four Olympic Games (2000-2012), won the 2007 World Cup at Nagoya (Japan) with coach Massimo Barbolini, ahead of Brazil and United States, and, in 2009, won the Mediterranean Games in Italy (which she had also done in 1997), the European Championships in Poland, after defeating the Netherlands 3-0 in the final, and the Grand Champions Cup in Japan. In 2002 she was a recipient of the title of Knight of the Italy’s Republic and, in 2004, of the Collare d’Oro for sporting merits. Piccinni’s fame extended beyond sports as well. In 2004, just before the Athina Olympics, she appeared naked in a calendar attached at the revue Men’s Health and a year later she wrote her autobiography called La Melagrana.

After three third-place finishes in the 100 yards freestyle, King eventually won the title in 1930. She also won two breaststroke titles to become the first swimmer to win titles at three different strokes. King also won every Scottish freestyle title available to her at both the junior and senior level. She became the first Scottish swimmer to set a world record when she swam the 200 yards breaststroke in 3:02.0 at Glasgow in 1927. The following year at Southport, she set a world best of 1:57.2 for the 150 yards backstroke. Also in 1928, she broke the 100 metre freestyle world record in her heat at the Olympics Games with a time of 1:22.0, only to see it broken minutes later by the eventual Netherlands gold medallist, Zus Braun. King won her first major international medal at the 1927 European Championships when, along with Joyce Cooper, Valerie Davies and Marion Laverty, she took the 4 x100 metres freestyle relay gold at Bologna. King then collected two silver medals at the 1928 Amsterdam Olympics. She was second in the 100 metres backstroke and also in the 4x100 free relay, with Cooper, Cissie Stewart, and Vera Tanner. At the 1930 British Empire Games, when she was captain of the Scotland ladies’ team, King went one better and won three medals. She won a silver in the 100 yards freestyle, bronze in the 200 yards backstroke, and another bronze in the 4x100 freestyle relay, with Stewart, Jean McDowall and Jessie McVey. King turned professional in 1934 to concentrate on teaching swimming at Edinburgh schools. She was also coach at the Warrender and Edinburgh University Ladies’ swimming clubs and was the Scottish national team coach for several years. After 40-years of teaching King retired in 1974 and, at the age of 65, married her first cousin Alfred Pearson. Her first husband Bobby Macpherson died in 1957. In 2001, nearly seven years after her own death, King’s Olympic and other medals were sold at auction and raised over £6,000 for the Alzheimers charity in Scotland, a disease from which she suffered in her later life.

A year later, he participated in the 1908 London Olympics and was a member of the Olympic relay team that won the bronze medal, although he did not run in the final, only in the semi-final. In 1910 he became the Hungarian champion in the 100 yards, and he set national records at two other distances, with 22.8 seconds in the 220 yards and 33.0 seconds in the 300 yards. In 1912 he took part in the Stockholm Olympics where he finished in 4th place with the 4 × 100 meter relay team. After that, however, he was removed from the Hungarian national team. In parallel with his sports career, he was a student at the Faculty of Law of the Royal Hungarian University of Budapest, obtaining his doctorate in 1913. Although he was no longer a member of the top team, he continued to compete in the BEAC until 1918. In addition to athletics, Rácz favored sledding and bobsledding among the winter sports. At the 1910 Hungarian championship, he took 2nd place in both the 3500-meter two-person bobsleigh race and the 2000-meter individual skeleton race. Later on he considered bobsled racing to be his passion and advertised for the 1924 Winter Olympics, looking for enterprising sportsmen. The entry went through, but the trip did not take place, probably for financial reasons. Rácz got a taste of journalism as early as 1909 when he became the editor of the sports section of the University Newspapers. He did this work until 1918, but in the meantime he was co-editor of Theater and Fashion from 1916 (until 1922). In addition to the latter paper, in 1919 he edited the newspaper Színház for a short time. In November 1919 he took over the management of the Madách Theater. Between 1921–1924, he performed the editorial duties of Sporthírlap, between 1924–1930 of Nemzeti Sport, and between 1929–1932 of Nők Újságja. For a decade and a half, from 1929 to 1944, Rácz was primarily the editor-in-chief of Pénzügyi Hírlap, but at the same time he contributed to the editing of several smaller papers. In addition to his journalistic activities, he was a member of the Democratic Party, and from 1925 to 1944 he participated in the work of the legislative authority committee of Budapest. After 1947 Rácz’s life became economically and politically impossible, as his newspapers, companies and his villa in Buda were taken away. In October 1955, he left the country with his family and found refuge in New Zealand. Personal Bests: 100 – 10.9 (1910); 200 - 22.6 (1909).",

As professionals, Gordeyeva and Grinkov won the World Professional Championships in 1991, 1992 and 1994 and toured with Stars on Ice.

In 1994 they won their only Russian title. After their second Olympics, the pair again turned professional and toured with Stars on Ice. In the summer of 1995, Gordeyeva and Grinkov were inducted into the World Figure Skating Hall of Fame and planned to return to Stars on Ice for their fourth season.

In 2011, Cho won the 500 metre short-track race at the World Championships, adding a bronze medal in the relay. Unfortunately, it was later revealed that at the 2011 Worlds, Cho had tampered with the blades of a Canadian skater, Olivier Jean, something which he stated he was told to do by then US short-track coach Chun Jae-Su, although Chun denied that. Chun shortly thereafter resigned as US coach, which also came after several US skaters accused him of verbal and physical abuse.

They skated together for one more year, winning a bronze medal at the 1985 World Championships, before splitting, at which point Eisler took a two-year hiatus from major competition. He partnered with Isabelle Brasseur in 1987 and they were runners-up at their first Canadian Championship together in 1988, in addition to placing 7th at the World Championships and 9th at the 1988 Winter Olympics. The following year they were 7th once more at the World Championships, but took the Canadian Championships and would never again fail to see the podium at any major tournament. The duo took second place at the 1990 World Championships, but slid to third at their national tournament. They regained the Canadian title the following year and held it through 1994. During that time, they won two bronze medals at the Winter Olympics in 1992 and 1994, as well as two more silver medals (1991 and 1994), one bronze (1992), and one gold (1993) at the World Championships.

His personal life began running into trouble in 2006 when he appeared on the reality television program “Skating with Celebrities” with partner and actress Kristy Swanson. The media began focusing on Eisler after he was alleged to have been romantically involved with Swanson while his wife Marcia O’Brien was pregnant in 2005, but Eisler claimed that his relationship did not begin until he and his wife were separated. He was further scrutinized after he was suspended from coaching by Skate Canada later that year for allegedly sending sexual messages to a 15-year-old student.

He would win eight additional provincial championships from 1951 through 1959 (missing only 1955) and four Canadian National Championships in 1951, 1952, 1954, and 1956. These successes qualified him to represent his country at two major international tournaments. At the 1952 Summer Olympics, he exited his first match with zero bad points after defeating Venezuela’s Ignacio Lugo by fall and, after dispatching Guatemala’s Marco Antonio Girón quickly, was one of only two remaining competitors without any bad points (the other being India’s Keshav Mangave. Subsequent losses to Risaburo Tominaga of Japan and Mangave, however, saw him eliminated from the tournament and out of medal contention. At the 1954 British Empire and Commonwealth Games, meanwhile, he finished fourth. Although he retired from active competition in 1959, he took up coaching two years earlier in 1957 and continued to train wrestlers until 1973. By career he started working with Northern Electric in Montreal, but in his 40s he returned to school and took up a new profession as a mechanic and engineer. This led him to Western Canada, where he was able to continue his coaching career, and eventually to New Brunswick, where he lived out the rest of his life. Even after his official retirement, he served as an engineering instructor at local community colleges. He was made a member of the New Brunswick Sports Hall of Fame in 2007.",

Katherine Grainger’s Olympic career seems to mirror Clarke in that respect. Grainger has been world champion on six occasions between 2003 and 2011 but her Olympic appearances had all ended with her being one step away from the top of the podium. The first of these second place finishes in 2000 was as part of the crew in the quadruple sculls that won Britain’s first ever Olympic rowing medal in a women’s event. Further silvers followed in the coxless pairs at Athens in 2004 and the quadruple sculls at Beijing in 2008 until it all came good for Grainger as she won the double sculls gold medal with Anna Watkins on home water in 2012. With a new partner, Victoria Thornley, she was hoping for a second gold in Rio, but, alas, it was to be a fourth silver medal as she became the first British woman to win medals at five consecutive Games and become the most decorated British female Olympian. Between 2003-11 Grainger won six world titles in three different events, and retired from rowing after the Rio Games. Grainger has a degree in law from Edinburgh University, a master’s degree in medical law from Glasgow University and further studied for a doctorate at King’s College, London.

His first major international competition was at an Italian gymnastics festival in 1895, followed by the Olympics a year later. In Athens, he won two titles with the German team on the parallel bars and horizontal bar, and added individual medals in the same events. After their return home, most team participants were excluded from the reactionary German Gymnastics Association as they were “involved in a sporting event dedicated to internationalism.” The winning teams were banned from national competitions in Berlin. A gymnastics teacher since 1890, he started writing books about his sport in the early 20th century. In 1933, Flatow was forced to “voluntarily” end his gymnastics club membership, as he was Jewish. A co-founder of the Jewish Gymnastics Club, he was nevertheless honoured at the 1936 Olympics, where all German Olympic champions were invited. In 1938, he fled the increasingly anti-Semitic Germany to live in the Netherlands, where his cousin and 1896 team mate Gustav Flatow also lived. The German occupation of the Netherlands meant renewed persecution, and on 3 October 1942, he was deported to the Theresienstadt concentration camp – in spite of appeals by the highly placed gymnastics official Christian Busch. He starved to death there before the end of the year. Since 1987, the German Gymnastics Federation awards the Flatow Medal, remembering both Alfred and Gustav, to be awarded for excellent all-around performances.",Cousin of Gustav Flatow Listed in Olympians Who Died in Nazi Concentration Camps (Theresienstadt concentration camp) Listed in Olympians Who Were Killed or Missing in Action or Died as a Result of War (†28 December 1942.

He raced under either the name Alfred Levegh or just simply Levegh, which was an anagram of his real name. After initially racing bicycles, Velghe turned to cars in 1898 and drove a Mors. He soon gained a reputation for being a great town-to-town racer and often got the better of such established drivers as Fournier, Jenatzy, Girardot, and Marcel Renault. Levegh won the 300km Bordeaux-Biarritz race in 1899 and also gained a reputation for being an excellent hill-climber. In 1900, Levegh won the Paris-Bayonne road race. When he won the Paris-Toulouse-Paris race that year, at an average speed in excess of 40 mph (65 kmh), it carried Olympic status and with it a gold medal for Levegh in what was a rare appearance of a motor vehicle event at the Olympic Games. In the winter of 1904, Levegh caught a cold and on 29 February that year died from chest problems. Nearly 18 months after he died, his sister gave birth to a son who was called Pierre Bouillin. He also went on to become a motor car racer under the name Pierre Levagh. Sadly, he lost his life in the worst ever motor racing disaster at Le Mans in 1955 when his Mercedes flew into the crowd killing him and 82 other people.",Uncle of Pierre Bouillin

It was as a footballer, however, that Bento would make his mark as a hard-tackling defender with Real Madrid. He was such a tough defender that he suffered many injuries throughout his career, and underwent five knee and two nose operations. He also had a tibia operation, and was treated for several rib and finger fractures Benito joined Real Madrid at the age of 17 in August 1964 and moved up to the senior squad in 1966. He was then sent on loan to Rayo Vallecano for two seasons, however, before making his Madrid first-team début on 26 October 1969, against Real Sociedad. Between then and his retirement in 1982 he played 420 games and scored three goals. In those 13 seasons Benito won six Spanish League titles (1972, 1975-76, 1978-80) and the Spanish Cup five times (1970, 1974-75, 1980, 1982). Unfortunately he never won a European title because Madrid’s European glory days were behind them during his time in the first team. Benito won 22 Spanish caps between 1971-78, but never played in a major international tournament, because Spain failed to qualify for the World Cup in 1974 and the European Championships of 1972 and 1976. He was originally penciled in to make the journey to Argentina for the 1978 World Cup Finals but coach Ladislao Kubala left him out because he felt there were too many Real Madrid players in the squad. Benito’s international career therefore ended on 29 March 1978 in a 3-0 win over Denmark at Gijón. Before retiring, Benito bought two Madrid pubs that were meeting places for footballers past and present. After retirement from playing, he did some public relations work for Madrid and also worked with his friend Antonio Camacho at Vallecano. Goyo Benito died at the Ballesol nursing home in the Mirasierra district of Madrid where he was living after suffering from Alzheimer’s in the latter part of his life. Sadly he died as a result of contracting the coronavirus COVID-19, which also killed many of his fellow residents at the home.","Listed in Olympians Who Died After Contracting the Coronavirus (COVID-19) () Listed in Olympians Who Participated in the 1968 Olympic Football Qualification Campaign (2 App. - 0 goals - 180 min. played: ISL 1:1 (a), GBR 0:0 (a))"

One of his outstanding merits is that in September 1961 he started the master’s program in fencing at the College of Physical Education as an independent specialty.

He broke one ski after two km, turned back about 100 m, borrowed an unwaxed ski, using it until the 10 km checkpoint, where he switched to a suitably waxed ski. In that incident, he lost at least two minutes, but finished the course in a fury, advancing from 17th to 4th place, only 41.2 seconds behind the bronze medalist. At his two Winter Olympics he competed in all six possible cross-country events, never finishing worse than eighth place. His only Olympic medal, however, was in the 1956 relay, despite his running the first leg for Sweden, when he had the team’s worst leg, leaving them almost 2½ min behind the leading Russians. Larsson’s credentials include an impressive 12 starts for the national team at the Swedish Ski Games with the victory in the 15 km in 1955 and relay golds in 1961 and 1962. He made his début at the Swedish Championships in 1952 in Umeå. He won four silver and four bronze medals individually at the Swedish championships, coming his closest to an individual Swedish Championship title in 1962 in the 15 km, beaten by Assar Rönnlund in the sprint by less than a ski length. He also had two second places and a third for SK Järven in the relay. In his last two competitive years, 1965 and 1966, Larsson competed for IFK Umeå, winning another four team Championships. During the years 1949-66 Lennart Larsson competed in 394 races, won 74 and was in the top three 188 times. He defeated Swedish ski legends Rönnlund 46 times and Sixten Jernberg 23 times. After his almost 20-year racing career, including 10 years with the Swedish national team, Larsson reduced his training and during his last sporting year 1965/66, studied at Bosön Sport Folkhögskola. Between 1966-72 he worked as a national trainer and in conjunction with this assignment, he was educated from 1971-73 at the GIH (Swedish School of Sport and Health Sciences) in Stockholm to become a physical education teacher with cross-country skiing as main subject. He worked as a teacher at the ski line in Älvsbyn 1973-78 and in the 1980s at Lycksele Ski School. He was ski instructor for the national team at the Winter Olympics from 1968 to 1980 and at the World Championships in 1970, 1978, and 1982. Larsson was appointed “Stor Grabb” (Big Boy) No. 42 in Swedish skiing, an honorary award in Swedish sports.",Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the World Nordic Ski Championships (1–0–1 1956 Cortina d'Ampezzo (Olympics) CCS bronze: 4×10 km relay; 1958 Lahti CCS gold: 4×10 km relay)

She was a latecomer to athletics, running her first serious race at the age of 24 to raise money for cancer research in honour of her late father. MacLeod quickly rose through the ranks of distance running and became Scottish Cross-Country champion for three successive years 1985, 1986 and 1987. Chosen by Scotland to race the 10000m at the 1990 Commonwealth Games, she placed 12th despite having a rib broken when hit by a competitor’s flying elbow. A win at the 1993 Seville Marathon earned her a place in the British team for the World Championships in Stuttgart where she finished 16th behind winner Junko Asari. Returning to Scottish colours for the 1994 Commonwealth Games, she ran her best ever marathon time but narrowly missed a medal when finishing 4th, just a minute behind the bronze medallist. Around this time, she became sponsored by Scottish rock band Runrig, which included her brother-in-law, and was famously reported as listening to the band during her training runs. A good showing at the 1996 Houston Marathon ensured qualification for the British team for the 1996 Summer Olympics. In Atlanta she finished 45th from 88 starters, sixteen minutes behind the gold medallist. Two years after her Olympic experience her running form declined dramatically and she was eventually diagnosed with Berger’s Disease, also known as IgA nephropathy, a variant of renal failure. She worked for the National Health Service and stayed in athletics as a coach but eventually her condition deteriorated to the point where she needed a kidney transplant. A month after receiving a new kidney in 2008 she ran the Isle of Skye Half Marathon. She died suddenly in 2021. Personal Best: Mar – 2-33:16 (1994).",

Korjus did cross-country skiing in his youth and took up javelin throwing when he was 17-years-old. He rose to prominence in 1987, when he surprisingly won his first Finnish title, although he did not make the Finnish World Championships team that year. The next year Korjus defended his Finnish title and then threw a new Finnish record of 86.50 just a month before the Olympics, which was the third best performance to that time with the new model javelin. At the Seoul Olympics, he was still not considered a favorite, that role going to Korjus’ teammate Seppo Räty and young Czech javelin prodigy Jan Železný. In the Olympic final, going into the final round, Železný led with 84.12, just head of Räty, but Korjus was the last thrower, and came through with 84.28 to win gold.

Väli won his second Olympic medal, however, a bronze, in 1936 and also participated at the 1933, 1934, 1937 and 1938 European Championships, where he was fourth, fifth, fourth and fourth in Greco-Roman lightweight, respectively.

He equalled the world record of 9.3 for 100y three times, set world records of 20.1 and 20.0 for 220y straight, and set the world record of 22.2 for the 220y hurdles. After a poor start in the 1960 Olympic 100 metre final, Dave Sime narrowly failed to catch world record holder, Armin Hary of West Germany, at the tape. He also ran a great anchor leg in the relay to make up a two meter-deficit on the West Germans, but although Sime broke the tape in a world record time, the Americans were disqualified for a faulty change-over on the first pass. Sime came to Duke on a baseball scholarship, and only took up track for “something to do.” While he was in medical school at Duke, he played one year of football (American) as a wide receiver. Despite his lack of experience, he was a 29th round pick in the 1959 NFL draft by the Detroit Lions. After graduation, Sime turned down pro baseball offers in order to attend Duke Medical School. He did his residency at the Bascon-Palmer Eye Institute in Miami, and became a practicing ophthalmologist in Miami. He made headlines in the 1970s for his successful treatment of Miami Dolphins quarterback, Bob Griese, for some vision problems, and Sime numbered among his celebrity clients Mickey Mantle, Don Shula, and Jim Murray. His grandson, Christian McCaffrey, later became a top running back in the NFL.

72741,Amos Biwott,Male,8 September 1947,181.0,66, Kenya,KEN,"Amos Biwott was the first of the many Kenyan runners who have come to dominate the 3,000 metre steeplechase. Biwott’s surprising win at the Mexico City Olympics presaged Kenyan dominance in distance running. Biwott had only run three steeplechase races before the Olympics, and his technique was ungainly at best, but he was the first man to have the courage not to place one foot on the barrier. Nonetheless, he cleared the whole obstacle in a rustic hurdling technique and, in doing so, reduced his clearance time. In Mexico City he was the only runner who made it across the finish line with completely dry feet in both the Olympic qualifying heat and the final, which he won by 0.6 seconds ahead of compatriot Benjamin Kogo. After this golden moment, Biwott’s athletics career went slowly downward. He finished third at the 1970 Commonwealth Games, was sixth at the 1972 München Olympics and finished his career with an eighth place at the 1974 Commonwealth Games. After his athletics career, Biwott worked for the Kenya Prisons Service until his ignominious release in 1978 when he was prosecuted for theft. After that he was a watchman at the stadium.

Rather than take both boats all the way to Cowes, where the rest of the Olympic races were held, it was agreed to hold the 12-metre class races on the River Clyde and thus it became the only Olympic event ever to be held in Scotland. The local entry, Hera, won the first two races of a three-race series and the third race was not contested. Thomas Glen-Coats was the eldest of four sons of Sir Thomas Glen-Coats, Bt. and succeeded to the Baronetcy on the death of his father in 1922. Educated at Eton and Merton College, Oxford, he enjoyed a life of leisure and played no part in the hugely prosperous family business, J&P Coats, Ltd., the spinning merchants. In 1935, at the age of 57, Sir Thomas married Louise Hugon (formerly Mrs JC Newman) of Paris and as there was no issue to the marriage, the Baronetcy died with Sir Thomas in 1954.",

After the nine-foot circle and the stiff wooden-handled hammer to which he had been accustomed at home, Flanagan initially had some difficulty in adapting to the American seven-foot circle and an implement with a pliable handle. Once he mastered making three turns in the smaller circle, Flanagan was virtually invincible. During the 15 years he lived in America, he topped the world ranking list 12 times and set 16 world records, culminating with a throw of 184-4 (56.18) on 24 July 1909. For championships, Flanagan could count, besides his Olympic golds, seven AAU hammer titles and six with the 56 lb. weight. He also won a second British AAA title in 1900 en route to the Paris Olympics. He returned to Ireland in 1911 and made his final international appearance when he won the hammer throw for Ireland in their match against Scotland. His successes were not limited to the hammer and weight events. He placed fourth in the 1904 discus and surprisingly for a man of his size, he finished second in both the high and long jumps and the all-around event at the 1895 Irish championships. Flanagan is always listed as representing the United States at his three Olympics, but in 1900 he was possibly still an Irish (actually British in that era) citizen, and we have not been able to find information about his naturalization status for 1904 or 1908.

He joined the Army when he was 18, continuing with his boxing while doing his National Service. However, during a boxing tournament, he suffered an injury causing blood vessels to burst, which ended his boxing career. Despite this setback, Gradley stayed in the Army, going into the PT (Physical Training) Corps. Becoming a gymnast instructor to the cadets, Gradley met up with Nik Stuart, Tommy Slaven and Jack Scrivener. Known as the “Fab Four”, they trained “like demons” in gymnastics. The four of them won the Adams Shield in 1955, the first of no fewer than 13 wins for the Army, a feat that no club has equalled. Gradley was himself on the winning team for the Army from 1955-58 and once more in 1965. Gradley’s first major international competition was the 1957 European Gymnastics Championships in Paris. This was followed by an appearance at the 1958 World Gymnastics Championships in Moskva. In Moskva, he met the Soviet gymnast and World Champion Yury Titov. Titov was a big influence on Gradley and Stuart. Gradley went on to compete at two more Gymnastics Championships: 1962 in Praha, and 1966 in Dortmund. After competing at the 1960 Roma Olympics, Gradley was scheduled to take part in the European Gymnastics Championships in Luxembourg the following year. However, a shoulder injury meant he was unable to compete, resulting in Stuart being Great Britain’s only competitor at the championships. Despite his success, Gradley never became the British Champion, due to Stuart’s dominance in the sport. However, this did not stop the two from being close friends. Gradley left the Army in 1966 and became the gymnastics and fitness coach at Leeds Athletic Institute. The same year he once again was part of the team that won the Adams Shield. As a coach, the team from Leeds won the title three more times in the 1970s.",

105458,Mark Lewis-Francis,Male,4 September 1982,183.0,89, Great Britain,GBR,"As a junior Mark Lewis-Francis was widely touted as the next great superstar of sprinting and won the World Youth and World Junior titles in successive years in 1999 and 2000. He passed up a relay place at the Sydney Olympics to concentrate on the World Juniors. At the start of 2001 he made his senior début for Great Britain at the World Indoor Championships and won a bronze medal in the 60 metres. As the year progressed he added the Europa Cup and European Junior 100 metre title to his portfolio and was chosen for the 2001 World Championships. Lewis-Francis was eliminated in the semi-finals at Edmonton after appearing to have broken the 10 second barrier in his quarter-final, but the time was not ratified due to a faulty wind gauge. He might have expected to pick up a first major gold medal in 2002 but he pulled up injured in the final of the Commonwealth Games 100 and was unable to recover in time for the European Championships. Lewis-Francis’s first Olympic Games started with disappointment when he missed qualification for the 100 m final at Athens by only one position but ended in tears of joy as held off the challenge of former Olympic Champion Maurice Greene to anchor the British quartet home to an improbable victory in the sprint relay. From then on his best performances appeared to be restricted to relay races. He helped the British win bronze medals at both the 2005 and 2007 World Championships and England to win the 2006 Commonwealth Games relay team.

Hamilton turned professional in 1995 and rode for the US Postal Service team from 1998-2000 as a lieutenant for Lance Armstrong. But he left US Postal in 2001 and became a top professional in his own right. Hamilton’s best known victory was a 2004 Olympic gold medal in the individual time trial, but it was marred by a doping test that had a positive A sample. But the B sample had been frozen and could not be tested so Hamilton did not have a doping violation and initially kept his gold medal. He was later implicated in the Operación Puerto scandal and was suspended after a doping positive at the 2004 Vuelta à España. His Olympic gold medal was eventually stripped. Hamilton came back in 2008 to win the US National Championship, but in 2009 had a doping positive for DHEA and an anti-depressant, and subsequently retired. His major victories also included Liège-Bastogne-Liège in 2003, Dauphiné-Libéré in 2000, and the Tour of Romandie in 2003-04.

Thus this was not a doping positive. However, the Russian Olympic Committee protested, as their rider, Vyacheslav Yekimov, would have moved up to the gold medal position. This protest was eventually disallowed by the Court of Arbitration for Sport and Hamilton retained his gold medal. However in 2011 he confessed that he had used doping products for a large part of his career and voluntarily returned his Olympic gold medal to the IOC.

In 1991 he bettered this feat, winning the World middle-heavyweight title and went to the 1992 Olympics as a clear favorite for the Olympic middle-heavyweight gold. At the Olympics, however, Syrtsov was upset by teammate Akakios Kakiasvili, who lifted the same result as Syrtsov (412.5 kg), but was awarded the gold medal due to a lighter bodyweight. After the Olympics Syrtsov switched to sub-heavyweight class but, at the next major championships, the 1993 World Championships, he again lost the gold medal due to a heavier bodyweight, this time to teammate Viktor Tregubov. In 1994 Syrtsov won the World sub-heavyweight title, but also missed the World title in 1995 due to heavier bodyweight, again losing to Kakiasvili. After the 1995 World Championships Syrtsov switched weight classes again, this time to heavyweight, and won another Olympic silver in that class in 1996.

68969,Seb Coe,Male,29 September 1956,175.0,54, Great Britain,GBR,"Although the brilliant career of Seb Coe included a number of disappointments, the highlights were such that he must be considered as one of the greatest middle-distance runners of all time. After winning the British 1,500 metres title at both Youth and Junior level, his first major international championship success came when he won the 1977 European indoor 800 metres title at Dortmund with a new British indoor record of 1:47.6 seconds. Within the next month he had twice improved the record and later in the year headed the British outdoor record, clocking 1:44.95 at Crystal Palace in September. In 1978, Coe brought the British 800 metres record down to 1:44.25 seconds in August before making a further improvement the following month with a run of 1:43.97. Although this fine performance ranked no higher than eighth on the world all-time list, the breaking of the 1:44 barrier placed Coe early among the world’s elite and he was to confirm his place in spectacular fashion the following year. Within the space of 42 days in July and August 1979, he posted new world records for the 800 metres, 1,500 metres and 1 mile. In 1980 he took over as the world record holder at 1,000 metres and in 1981 he improved his own world records at 800 metres and 1,000 metres before twice improving his own record for the mile. His only world record in 1982 came when he contributed a 1:44.01 second leg on Britain’s 4×800 metre relay team; the following year he posted world indoor records at 800 metres and 1,000 metres. In all, Seb Coe set nine world records outdoors and three indoors, and this alone would have been more than enough to ensure his place as one of the legends in the sport. But in addition to his phenomenal talents as a record breaker, Coe was also a superlative performer in major championship events. He is the only man in modern times to have won the Olympic 1,500 metres title twice and his victory in 1980 when he came back from losing the 800 metres, for which he was an overwhelming favorite, was testament to his moral fortitude. In addition to all his Olympic gold medals at 1,500 metres in 1980 and 1984, he finished second in the 800 metres at both of these Games. He also won over 800 metres at the European and World Cup in 1981 and the European Championships in 1986. Coe missed selection for his third Olympic Games after an inexplicably poor run in the trials and finished a disappointment sixth in the last major race, the 1,500 metres at the 1990 Commonwealth Games. But these were no more than minor blemishes on a superb career. Some ten years later, his world records for 800 metres and 1,000 metres still stood and for these to have survived throughout the greatest decade of mid-distance running that the world has ever seen was a clear indication of the calibre of Coe’s performances. After retiring from top-class competition, Seb Coe entered politics and served as the Member of Parliament for Falmouth and Camborne, as a member of the Conservative party between 1992 and 1997. He was awarded the MBE in 1982, the OBE in 1990 and then in 2000 he was elevated to the peerage with the title Baron Coe of Ranmore. He has married twice, firstly to three day event rider Nicola McIrvine and then in 2011 to Carol, daughter of former England cricket captain Mike Smith. In 2004 Coe took over as Chairman of the London bid for the 2012 Olympics and was widely credited for the success of the bid. As well as being the chairman of the 2012 Olympic Games organising committee he is also a vice-president of the International Amateur Athletics Federation and has been both head of FIFA’s ethics committee and a steward of the British Boxing Board of Control.

Born of Irish parents in Glasgow, he was brought up in the Pollokshaws district of the city and went on to become a champion cyclist, heavyweight boxing champion, racehorse owner, and innovative bookmaker. As a cyclist, Flynn competed in his first Scottish National Championship in 1902 and, two years later, reached the semi-final of the 2 km amateur sprint race at the World Championships at Crystal Palace. Also in 1904, he became the first Scottish cyclist to win an International event when he won the five-mile race at the British Empire Championships in Gosforth. At the same Championships in 1906 Flynn finished third in the five-mile, but beat the crack English riders, Ernie Payne and Ben Jones, to win the quarter-mile title. That same year, as a member of the Albert CC, Flynn confirmed his standing as the best Scottish cyclist of the day, when he won an unprecedented four Scottish titles, at a quarter-mile, and one-, five- and 10 miles. In 1908, and one month after competing in the Olympics, he won two more Empire titles when he won the quarter-mile and 10 mile titles when, in the latter, he beat Ben Jones and Clarrie Kingsbury. As well as winning National titles in Scotland and Ireland he travelled south of the border in 1911 to win the one-mile title at the British Championship at Crystal Palace. Having turned to boxing in 1907, Flynn won the amateur heavyweight title of Scotland before turning professional in 1912. He had 10 bouts in a five year career, which was interrupted by the War, when he served, firstly, in the Flying Corps, before switching to the Army Service Corps. The best win of his professional career was in beating Dixie Kid on points over 10 rounds at the Scottish National Club, Glasgow, in 1912. Kid had previously beaten Georges Carpentier. Flynn also taught a good friend of his, Victor McLaglen, to box in readiness for a movie role. McLaglen won the Best Actor Oscar for his part in the 1935 film The Informer. Flynn’s illustrious career continued after he became a leading Scottish bookmaker with offices in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen, Dundee and London. He also sponsored horse races and owned several horses. At a time when bets were placed merely on the outcome of an event, Flynn became an innovator and would accept bets on other eventualities, which now form an essential part of modern day betting.",

From 1913-15 Oreste Moricca studied at the Military Academy and fought bravely in World War I. Crippled by enemy bullets, he was awarded a bronze medal for military valour and several other medals. With the return of peace he returned to his passions: stories and literary studies (he had graduated in 1924 in French literature). He reached the international level as a fencer, winning the 1920 Italian military championship. In 1924, he won gold and bronze medals at the Paris Olympics, and he later participated as a judge at the 1936 Berlin Olympics.

66080,William Halpenny,Male,23 May 1882,,, Canada,CAN,"As a youth, Bill Halpenny was always athletically active in a variety of sports, but it was track and field that most captured his interest. He practiced the high jump, broad jump, hop, step and jump, and hurdles, but his talents were best displayed in the pole vault. He joined the Abegweit Amateur Athletic Association in 1901 after breaking the Maritime pole vaulting record with a jump of 10-1 and, by July of 1904, he held the Canadian national outdoor record in the sport at 11-5. His feats earned him a trip to the 1904 Summer Olympics, where his pole failed to arrive in time for the competition and he was forced to borrow one that was several inches shorter. He competed in the handicap meet, placing fourth with a jump of 11-0, and some sources claim that he competed in the main Olympic event as well, although no contemporary evidence for this has been discovered. In 1905 Halpenny moved to Montreal and joined the Montreal Amateur Athletic Association at the urging of Frank Lukeman. Although Halpenny and Lukeman defected at one point to the St. Patrick’s Amateur Athletic Association, they soon became Montreal AAA’s most prominent competitors. Nevertheless Halpenny did not qualify for the 1908 Summer Olympics, but put his frustrations to productive use and began to concentrate on mastering his pole vaulting skills. By September he had captured the U.S. National Championship and less than a year later he took the Canadian one. His efforts secured him a spot with the Canadian delegation to the 1912 Summer Olympics, where the tournament’s record would be broken by all of the top seven finishers. Halpenny was one of these top seven, but was seriously injured during one of his jumps and was forced to withdraw after being carried off the field. Noting problems with the landing pit, the Olympic committee awarded him a special bronze medal for his achievements. Whether or not his 1904 appearance is counted, he was Prince Edward Island’s first Olympic competitor, as the next person from the province to attend the Games would be a student of Halpenny’s, Phil MacDonald in 1924. Halpenny rebounded from his injuries and competed in the Canadian National Championships later that year, defeating 1912 Olympic gold medalist Harry Babcock to claim the title, a feat that he would repeat in 1913. The cancellation of the 1914 competition, due to the onset of World War I, signaled the end of his career as an active competitor, but it was not the end of his association with athletics. After the conflict he was named coach of the Abegweit AAA and served in that capacity for many years. In 1922, now aged forty and not having competed professionally for nearly a decade, he set a new Maritime record in the pole vault by clearing 11-4. Personal Best: PV – 3.80 (1912).",

Shortly before the end of World War I, the family fled to Beuel, since 1969 a part of the city of Bonn. Five of the sons played for the youth team of the local club SV 06 Beuel. When the boys were promoted to the first XI, after a few years, in 1935-36, the club rose to the Gauliga level, Germany’s first division at the time. Three of the brothers were included in the team representing the Central Rhineland by the later national coach Sepp Herberger. Herberger also recommended Franz Elbern, a speedy right-winger, to the acting national coach Otto Nerz, who fielded him for the first time in 1935 in the national team’s game against Luxembourg. In the Olympic tournament he played Luxembourg again.

He was mentioned in dispatches several times, and received the Victory and British medals. After the hostilities, Coleman turned professional and used the name “Bull Coleman”, so called because he weighed around 15 stone (95kg) and adopted an aggressive bull-like style of fighting. He went on to win seven more British titles as a professional. After ending his wrestling career, Coleman worked as a sports secretary and physical training instructor, and ran his own gymnasium where he coached his son Vic, who started wrestling at the age of eight. At the age of 15, Vic became the youngest professional wrestler in the country, fighting under the name of “Young Bull”. He went on to become the 1951 British Empire middleweight champion. Vic also featured in many movies and television programmes as a stuntman and, most famously, in the advertisement for Cadbury’s Milk Tray chocolates that featured the slogan “All because the lady loves Milk Tray”.",

Downing was from California and was not well-known by the Eastern riders; consequently he surprised a lot of people by beating out Teddy Billington race after race. The trip to St. Louis was part of a longer one which took Downing to the New York area where he settled. He joined up with a contracting firm, the Spearin Co., and by 1909, had become the president of that firm. He was later president of the New York Contracting Dock Builders Association. Downing’s brother, Hardy, was also a cyclist, though less well-known. But he became a famous boxing promoter, particularly known for promoting the fights of world heavyweight champion Jack Dempsey.",
68755,Mary Peters,Female,6 July 1939,173.0,71, Great Britain,GBR,"In the 45th pentathlon of her career, the veteran Mary Peters of Spartan Ladies AC achieved the ultimate athletic success by winning an Olympic title with a new world record. The English-born Peters spent much of her life in Ireland and her first pentathlon competition was at Ballymena in 1955. In the 17 years leading up to her Olympic triumph, she won seven WAAA pentathlon titles as well as the gold medal at the Commonwealth Games in 1970, and finished fourth in the 1964 Olympics and ninth in 1968. She also won the WAAA shot put title twice and was the Commonwealth Games champion in 1970. After the 1970 Commonwealth Games in Edinburgh, she took a rest from competition and devoted 1971 to intensive training guided by her coach Buster McShane. Her form early in 1972 indicated that despite her age she would be a strong contender for the Olympic title. After the opening event (100 metre hurdles) in München the 33-year-old Peters was in second place, just six points behind the leader. She moved into the lead after the second event (shot put) and at the end of the first day she held a lead of 301 points. The West German Heide Rosendahl-Ecker, in front of her home crowd, made a superb effort on the second day and made up 291 points on Peters, but she still finished a tantalizing 10 points behind the ecstatic British winner. The last event was the 200 metres, with the two contenders for the gold medal drawn in the same heat. Rosendahl came home ahead of Peters, her overall score of 4791 points giving her the world record for a fraction over one second. Precisely 1.2 seconds after Rosendahl had completed the race, and the competition, Peters reached the 200 metres finishing line and with a total of 4,801 points the world record passed to her. Mary Peters, who was awarded the MBE in 1973 and the CBE in 1990, competed for two more years and in her fifth appearance at the Commonwealth Games in 1974, she successfully defended her pentathlon title. After retirement she remained active in sports-related civic affairs and fund-raising in Belfast, and was the team manager for many women’s international athletic teams. Peters was appointed Lord Lieutenant of the City of Belfast in 2009.

Lönnberg began his artistic career by studying at a private school before holding an exhibition in Stockholm in 1912. In January 1914 he moved to Paris and became part of a group of Swedish painters based in the south of the city. Later that year Lönnberg joined the French Foreign Legion as a corporal just after the start of World War I. However when he was fighting for the French side he was killed in action near the German line in the final year of the war. Including his paintings from art school and self-portraits Lönnberg had a relatively small oeuvre with approximately 50 known works. Most of his surviving works are housed in the Moderna Museet in Stockholm with around 35 items listed in their collection. In 1942 a memorial exhibition was held with 48 of Lönnberg’s works being shown. As well as being an artist Lönnberg had a brief career as a distance runner. At the 1912 Stockholm Olympics he was selected to run in the marathon but did not finish the course.

After winning the decathlon at the 1977 Canada Games, Dave entered the University of Toronto, where he honed his skills. He set the first of 10 Canadian records in the event in 1979 and was selected to represent his nation at the 1980 Summer Olympics, which were eventually boycotted by Canada. After becoming the first Canadian to earn 8,000 points in 1982, he was runner-up in the event at that year’s Commonwealth Games, behind 1980 and 1984 Olympic champion Daley Thompson. In 1983 he won gold medals at the Summer Universiade and the Pan American Games, before coming in eighth in the decathlon at the Summer Olympics. He raised the pentathlon record a final time in 1986 and won another silver at that year’s Commonwealth Games, again behind Thompson, but failed to finish in the event at the 1987 World Championships. His final tournament was the 1988 Summer Olympics, where he got off to an inauspicious start of seventeenth after the 100 metres, followed by a jump up to eighth place after a fifth place finish in the long jump. Sixteenth in the shot put and high jump knocked him down to twelfth overall, while eighth in the 400 metres, ninth in the 110 metre hurdles, and twelfth in the discus helped him move up to ninth overall. After coming in second in the pole vault, he made it to the bronze medal position with seventh-place finishes in the javelin throw and 1,500 metres to become Canada’s first and, as of 2012, only Olympic decathlon medalist. He was named Ontario Athlete of the Year and retired from active competition, following up his career with color commentating for CTV and involvement in anti-doping campaigns.

50360,Arne Borg,Male,18 August 1901,,, Sweden,SWE,"Arne Borg was one of the prominent freestyle swimmers of the 1920s. With his unusual stroke, he set 32 world records between 1921-29 and won five Olympic medals. Regarded as the “big bad man” of European swimming because of his unusual training habits, Borg was highly popular among swimming fans. As an example, after failing to show up for conscription and going on holiday instead, he was briefly imprisoned, but received food and drinks from fans, and was noted to gain weight while in jail. Borg first competed internationally at the 1920 Olympics, where he was fourth with the Swedish 4x200 m freestyle relay team and reached the semifinals of the 1,500 freestyle. At the 1924 Olympics, Borg failed to win an Olympic title, losing to his Australian rival Boy Charlton in the 1,500, and to Johnny Weismuller in the 400, while placing fourth in the 100 freestyle and winning bronze in the 4x200 relay. However, he became the first swimmer to swim in all freestyle events finals at the Olympics, the only person to repeat that feat being Alberto Zorrilla, who achieved this feat in 1928. Borg finally got his Olympic title in Amsterdam, when he beat Charlton over 1,500 metres, and also won bronze in the 400 freestyle at the 1928 Olympics. At the European Championships, Borg won the 400 and 1,500 metre freestyle titles in 1926, and 100, 400 and 1,500 free titles in 1927, adding a 100 m freestyle silver and 4x200 m freestyle relay bronze in 1926, and a 4x200 m freestyle relay silver in 1927. In 1926 Borg also won silver in water polo at the European championships. While winning his 1,500 m freestyle European title in 1927, Borg recorded his most notable world record, finishing in 19:07.2 and thus becoming the first person to swim 1,500 m under 20 minutes, a record that stood for nearly 12 years. Borg’s also set many other notable freestyle world records. Borg won 40 Swedish swimming titles and four water polo titles during his career and was awarded the Svenska Dagbladet Gold Medal in 1926. In 1930 he turned professional and toured with aquatic shows. After that he worked as a swimming coach and ran his own tobacco shop in Stockholm. His twin brother Åke was also an international level swimmer, who won silver in the 4x200 free relay at the 1927 European Championships and bronzes in the 4x200 free relay at the 1924 Olympics and 1926 European Championships.

He was considered a promising wrestler, but a thyroid disorder caused by excessive stress in 1957 nearly put an early end to his wrestling career. It took almost three years to recover from the disease, after surgery where part of his thyroid gland was removed. Roshchin, who competed in Greco-Roman heavyweight for his entire career, won his first Soviet Championships medal, silver, in 1961. The next year, he won gold at the Soviet Championships and was selected for the Soviet national team. Roshchin made his international début at the 1962 World Championships, where he won silver. At the 1963 World Championships, Roshchin won a gold medal and went to the 1964 Olympics as a clear favorite for the Olympic Greco-Roman heavyweight title. At the Olympics, however, Roshchin wrestled a draw with István Kozma in the final round and, due to the bad points system, had to settle for a silver medal. Between the Olympics, Roshchin competed at two major international tournaments, winning gold at the 1966 European Championships and silver at the 1967 World Championships, and had to settle for silver again at the 1968 Olympics, after once more drawing with Kozma in the final round. After the 1968 Olympics, Roshchin was nearly undefeated, winning gold at the 1969 and 1971 World Championships and silver at the 1972 World Championships. At the 1972 Summer Olympics, by then 40-years-old, Roshchin won gold. Domestically, in addition to his 1961 and 1962 medals, Roshchin was Soviet Champion in 1963, 1967 and 1971, earning silver in 1964-65, 1968 and 1972. After finishing his sporting career in 1972, Roshchin worked as an international wrestling referee.",

In 1981 she won the US Championship and placed second at the World Championship, and she seemed on her way. In 1982, after stumbling to third at the Nationals, she won the World Championship, but after that her career stalled a bit. Zayak was one of the first truly great female jumpers, often landing multiple triple jumps in a routine. Because of this, in 1982 the ISU passed what many call the Zayak Rule, stating that a skater may not repeat a triple jump more than twice in a routine, and the later jump must be done in a combination or sequence. Zayak was second at the 1983 US Championship, skipping the Worlds that year due to injury. In 1984, she placed third at both the US and World Championships, but a horrible compulsory performance and a stumble in the short program kept her off the podium at the Sarajevo Olympics. Zayak then turned professional, but skated for only a few years, her routines often lackluster, and she then drifted away from the sport. But when professionals were allowed to compete at the 1994 Winter Olympics, she sought reinstatement and competed at the 1994 US Championships, finishing fourth, but wowing the crowd with her ability to still land triple jumps. Zayak then became a skating coach, working at the Ice House in Hackensack, New Jersey.",Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the World Figure Skating Championships (1–1–1 1981 Hartford silver: singles; 1982 København gold: singles; 1984 Ottawa bronze: singles)

In early 1992, Gutsu won the all-around, vault, and balance beam titles at the European Championships and established herself as one of the favorites for the Olympic all-around title. But at the Olympic preliminaries, Gutsu fell from the balance beam, qualifying ninth in all-around. As only three competitors from each country were allowed in the final, and because of Gutsu’s fall, three other competitors from the Unified Team had already placed higher, so Gutsu did not qualify. But the team coaches felt that Gutsu had a better chance of bringing home all-around gold than her teammates Svetlana Boginskaya and Roza Galiyeva. They decided to keep Boginskaya, as she was too famous and there would be a scandal, so they told Galiyeva to forfeit her place in the final so that Hutsu could compete. Galiyeva was forced to claim a severe knee injury, which was “verified” by the team physician. So Gutsu went onto the final, where she won a gold .012 points ahead of American Shannon Miller. Gutsu retired from sports due to injuries shortly after the 1992 Olympics. After her retirement, Hutsu moved to the United States and settled in Ohio, where she coached gymnastics.

The first defence of his world title against the Englishman Danny O’Sullivan became notorious as O’Sullivan suffered a record 14 knockdowns before the fight was stopped. Problems in making the bantamweight limit contributed to Toweel losing his title to fellow Olympian Jimmy Carruthers in 1950 and a year later a rematch ended with the same result.

Harper started work in a bleach factory but then joined the Bulwell Harriers and took up cross-country running. His build and style were not made for cross-country, however, and he turned to sprinting and went on to became one of the world’s best over 100 and 220 yards. Harper turned professional in 1887 and won his first race, and the accompanying prize of £15, at Nottingham. His biggest win came in the Sheffield Christmas Handicap in 1890 when he won the first prize of £100 (about £17,000 in 2023). He won the race again three years later and, after that win, he challenged any man in the world over 100 or 220 yards for a side bet of between £200 to £500. After his racing days were over, Harper became a football trainer at Bristol City and Stockport County before spending five seasons at Middlesbrough, until taking the job at Bradford City in 1906. He left City at the end of the 1915/16 season, having installed a fitness regime into the club that saw them promoted to the first division and win the FA Cup for the only time in their history, beating Newcastle United in the 1911 final. After leaving football Harper became landlord of the Greenfield Hotel in Bradford and an establishment at Marton, near Blackpool, before returning to Bradford and taking up the training job at Bradford Northern RLFC at the start of the 1923/24 season, just six months before his death. In 1894 Harper was involved in a much-publicised court case when his girlfriend Harriet Seagrave took him to court for breach of contract after Harper said he would marry her after winning his first Sheffield Christmas Handicap. He won the race in 1890 but claimed they were too you to marry so they decided to wait until after he won it a second time. Seagrave sued, and successfully won her case, after Harper still refused marriage after winning the race again in 1893.",

He first competed internationally at the 1966 British Empire and Commonwealth Games, where he won golds in the 110 yd freestyle, 4x110 yd freestyle, and 4x220 yd freestyle. The high point of his career came at the 1968 Mexico City Olympics, despite the fact that Wenden had trouble adjusting to Mexico City’s high altitude and for two weeks could not swim and hardly sleep. Wenden’s first event at the Olympics were 4x100 freestyle relay, where he helped Australian to a bronze medal. In the 100 freestyle Wenden posted the fastest times in the heats and semi-finals, but was not considered the favorite, that role going to Americans Mark Spitz, Ken Walsh and world record holder Zac Zorn. In the final, Wenden took lead from Zorn at 70 m and finished strongly to win gold in a world record time of 52.2. He then helped Australia’s 4x200 free relay to silver and then the next day won the 200 freestyle by beating the favored Don Schollander by a full body length. After the Olympics, Wenden won four golds (100 free, 200 free, 4x100 free relay, 4x200 free relay, the latter in a world record 7:50.8) and one silver (medley relay) at the 1970 British Commonwealth Games, but failed to medal at the 1972 Olympics. At the inaugural World Championships in 1973, Wenden won a 100 freestyle bronze and 4x200 free relay silver, before finishing his career at the 1974 British Commonwealth Games, where he won the 100 freestyle and 4x200 free relay, adding silver in the 4x100 free relay and medley relay, and bronze in the 200 freestyle. After finishing his sporting career, Wenden worked as the manager of the Palm Beach Aquatics Centre in Gold Coast, Victoria.

86551,Eric Heiden,Male,14 June 1958,185.0,84, United States,USA,"More than 40 years after his dominating performance at the 1980 Lake Placid Winter Olympics, Eric Heiden is usually still considered by most experts as the greatest speed skater of all-time – the GOAT. At Lake Placid Heiden entered five events and won gold in all five, punctuated by a world record in the final event, the 10,000 metres. Through 2022 Heiden’s five individual gold medals at a single Olympic Games has been matched only by Vitali Shcherba (EUN) at the 1992 Barcelona Olympics in gymnastics and Michael Phelps (USA) at the 2008 Beijing Olympics in swimming. Heiden competed at the 1976 Innsbruck Winter Olympics, but he was quite young and did not medal. Between then and 1980 he was rarely beaten, winning the World All-Around title in 1977-79, while winning all four races in 1979, and three of the four in 1978. He was also World Sprint Champion from 1977-80, also sweeping the four races in 1979, while winning three in 1978 and 1980. During his career, Heiden set nine world records – 3 in the 1,000 metres, 2 at 3,000 metres, one each in the 1,500 and 10K, and the sprint combination in 1980 and all-around combination in 1979. He also set seven junior world records between 1976-78. This was in the era of mostly outdoor rinks when many of the sports’ records were set at Medeo in Almaty, Kazakhstan, but Heiden never raced there once his career had peaked. He led the Adelskalender from 11 February 1979 to 7 March 1983, but his record score of 161.214 was not bettered by anyone outside of the Soviet Union, who skated at Medeo, until 1987. Heiden retired from speed skating after the 1980 Winter Olympics, and turned to a complementary sport, cycling. He briefly competed as a track racer, but then turned to the roads. He won the 1985 US Professional road race, and competed for the 7-Eleven team, riding the 1985 Giro d’Italia, which he finished, and the 1986 Tour de France, which he did not. Heiden was inducted into the US Cycling Hall of Fame in 1999. Heiden graduated from the University of Wisconsin and then entered medical school at Stanford University, graduating in 1991.

He was originally selected as a reserve for the 1906 Athens Olympics, but was called up when Albert Wills was no longer eligible to race as an amateur. Despite not being on top form, Bouffler still managed to win a silver medal behind the Italian Francesco Verri in the 1000 metres sprint. Joy of an Olympic medal was tinged with sadness, however, because his only child, aged six months, was taken ill, and died on 27 April 1906 while Bouffler was in Athens. Despite returning from Athens in poor health, Bouffler still took part in the Inter-Polytechnic Championships at Maida Vale and won the one lap and five-mile race - just two of many Inter-Poly races he won over the years.

920299,France Darget Savarit,Female,26 December 1886,,, France,FRA,"France Darget, now barely remembered, was famous during the “Belle Époque” among the literary circles in Tours. This had much to do with the quality of her poems, as well as the way she recited them, in a style of older and more established poets. Her father, a career officer, was also a spiritualist and author of a book with financial advice. She never attended a public school but, like other bourgeois children, went to a private school, where she was taught music, art and literature. The young poet was not older than 10 years of age when she was launched by the Tours newspapers, and quickly her notoriety reached the well-read circles of Paris, and she became a prominent person in the literary and artistic Tout-Paris. In 1901, Savarit was just 14-years-old when a first collection of her poems, previously printed in newspapers, was published. The poems attracted the attention of well-known authors. She even was awarded a gold medal by the National Academy of Sciences, Literature and Arts of Bordeaux. She wrote poems about the volcano eruption in Martinique, the Franco-Prussian war, the firefighters of Tour, and the Queen Semiramis of Babylon. Due to her conservative background and audience, her poems and ballads become more reactionary. She also began to write stage plays, and perform herself. In 1908, she got married and moved to Paris. For her anthology “Les Matinales”, she received the Prix Davaine of the Academie Française. She also founded the theater company “Le Coryphée”. Her second son, Christian Savarit, was to become a famous TV presenter under the pseudonym Claude Darget. Her play Les Thermopyles – a piece in one act in verses, with sports interludes – was originally written in 1921 for the Calliope Charissi, a Greek dancer who performed with her eleven children. In 1929, the play was staged in the Arena of Vallières. A local newspaper describes the setting: “On the track will be a faithful re-creation of the Olympic Games in Greece: racing, jumping, pugilism, archery and disc launch. This important staging, which is only possible in the open air, will bring together no less than 60 performers.” On March 2, 1940, the work, which deals with the battle between the Greek cities and the Persians during the Second Persian War, was broadcasted by Radio Paris.",

After winning the Olympic title in Berlin, Towns finished the 1936 season with one of the most memorable performances in track history. At a post-Olympic meet in Oslo, Towns was angry with the USOC officials for insisting that he remain in Europe rather than allowing him to return home for football practice; this ire spurred him to a world record of 13.7 that was to remain unbeaten for 14 years. Apart from his Olympic gold medal, Towns won the AAU in 1936, the NCAA in 1936 (where his 14.1 mark was his first recognized world record) and 1937 and, although he didn’t compete outdoors in 1938, he won the AAU indoor that year.

When he visited the island of Acaill off the west coast of Ireland in 1910, he was so impressed by the landscape that he stayed there for 10 years. Subsequently, he settled in Dublin, where he painted his last picture showing a human figure in 1920, after which he concentrated on idealized nature scenes, some of which he painted for advertising posters commissioned by railroad companies. Together with his wife, Henry was one of the founders of the Society of Dublin Painters and became a member of the Royal Hibernian Academy in 1929. Already partially color blind, he lost his sight completely in 1945, and then moved to Bray. Only after the death of his first wife in 1953 did he remarry, although the marriage had already broken up in the late 1920s.

Early in 1900 he retained his cross country crown, but by the summer he had developed a certain measure of speed and defeated a rather undistinguished field to take the AAA mile title. His winning time of 4:28.2 seconds did not augur well for his Olympic chances but 1900 was not a vintage year for milers and the best time recorded in the world that year was a modest 4:24.4 seconds by the American John Cregan. Cregan withdrew from the 1,500 metres at the Paris Olympics on sabbatical grounds and Bennett’s main challenger was Henry Deloge, the local idol and the world record holder at 1,000 metres. There were no heats for the 1,500 metres and after a close race Bennett beat Deloge by two metres in 4:06.2 seconds. This was said at the time to be a world record, although clearly many athletes had passed the 1,500 metres mark in a faster time during the course of a mile race. Nevertheless Bennett achieved the distinction of being the first British athlete to win an Olympic track and field event. Bennett won a second gold medal and set a second world record seven days later when he led Britain to victory in the 5000 metres team race and he had, in the interim, won a silver medal in the longer of the two steeplechase events. Despite his two world records and his Olympic titles, Charles Bennett remains a much under-rated athlete, particularly in historical rather than temporal terms. His performance at Paris in July 1900 was possibly the finest double by a British athlete since Fred Elborough achieved the remarkable feat of breaking the world record for both the 220 yards and the 880 yards in one afternoon in October 1876. Bennett’s Olympic season closed in October with a challenge match against Alfred Tysoe at Belle Vue, Manchester. Tysoe was the AAA and Olympic champion at 880 yards/800 metres and Bennett held identical titles at the mile/1500 metres distance, and a meeting was arranged over three-quarters of a mile, which was mid-way between their championship distances, to decide which of these two fine athletes was Britain’s leading middle-distance runner. Tyson won a close race in 3:13.0 seconds but Bennett’s British record of 3:10.6 seconds survived. Personal Bests: 1500 – 4:06.2 (1900); Mile – 4:24.2 (1899); 2 miles – 9:35.0 (1898); 5000 – 15:20.0 (1900); 4 miles – 19:48.0 (1899).",

Between 1915-17 Trissino was the author and director of several short films on horse riding, in many of which he acted together with Gemma Albini, whom he later married. Leaving the cavalry as a captain, the couple split their time between Roma, with Trissino attending at the King’s court, and Milano, where he devoted himself to musical composition, such as tango, fox-trot and one-step.

He repeated this feat in 1901, the same year that he first became the Irish national champion in place kicking. In 1906 he set a world record for distance in the 56-lb. weight throw and became the Irish national champion in five disciplines: the 56-lb. weight throw for height and for distance, the hammer throw, the shot put, and place kicking. Seeking to compete at the Olympics for a country other than Britain, he moved to North America and joined the Irish-American Athletic Club of New York. At a local tournament in June 1907 he bested his own record in the 56-lb. weight throw and then travelled to Canada, where it was noted by The Daily Sentinel of Woodstock, Ontario that he surpassed the world record in the hammer throw in a September practice. He then became the Canadian champion in the hammer throw and broke the national record for height in the 56-lb. weight throw in October. He improved his record at the May 1908 trials for Canada’s Olympic delegation to that year’s Summer Olympics in London, but was not selected to attend. Instead he paid his own way and, at the Games, earned a bronze medal in the hammer throw. Walsh reset the world record for height in the 56-lb. weight throw several times after the Olympics, including twice in September 1910. He also set a world record in the hammer throw while winning the event at the 1911 United States AAU Championships, but was not selected for the nation’s delegation to the 1912 Summer Olympics because he was not an American citizen. After moving to Seattle to train on the West Coast, he decided to retire from active competition in April 1912. Outside of sports he worked as a police officer, serving as a member and coach of the Seattle Police Force’s track team, and, in retirement, held a job as a doorman at a medical building, where he died in 1961 after falling down an elevator shaft.

In 1966, he saw great success at the Pacific Northwest skeet shooting championships in Spokane, Washington in which he won 4 events, including the high-overall title in which he defeated American Phil Giger with a 427 out of 450 total score. The top amateur skeet shooter of Canada of the 1960s, Sanderlin was also the winner of numerous Alberta provincial and regional skeet championship titles, and won multiple consecutive Western Canada skeet shooting championships in the late 1960s. He competed in his first international tournament in 1967 at the Pan American Games held in Winnipeg. At the 1968 Olympic trials held in Ste.

Prior to the Olympics, Willsie and Sanderlin were also invited to compete in the United States International Skeet Championships in San Antonio, Texas in which he finished 3rd. At the 1968 Olympics in Mexico City, Sanderlin competed in the skeet event and placed 15th with a score of 191 out of a possible 200, later noting that his performance was hampered by a case of the flu. In 1970, Sanderlin was named to the Sports Afield All-American skeet shooting team.

In 1972, Sanderlin won his fifth Canadian international-style skeet shooting championship title, breaking 185 out 200 targets and earning the right to represent Canada at Olympic Games for a second time, alongside fellow 1967 Pan American Games teammate Bruno De Costa. This time, he placed 50th in a field of 63 competitors. Invited to compete in the British Commonwealth Games at Christchurch in 1974 but unable to travel due to business commitments, Sanderlin would compete in his final international tournament at the 1975 Pan American Games in Mexico City. He later continued to compete in provincial and Canada-wide tournaments throughout the late 1970s and 1980s. Sanderlin was born in 1933 at Viking, Alberta, one of two children born to Edwin H. and Alyce Sanderlin. He was raised and educated in Edmonton, attending Old Strathcona High School before receiving certification as an electrician at the Southern Alberta Institute of Technology (SAIT) in Calgary. After his graduation, he obtained his journeyman papers and worked as an electrician for Brothers Electric in Edmonton, and later joined Hillas Electric where he started shifting to work in a management capacity. Originally joining the company as an estimator and plant superintendent, Sanderlin eventually rose by the early 1970s to become the president and general manager of an electrical contracting firm, Wilf Got & Associates Electric, with offices in Edmonton and Calgary. By the late 1980s, he was associated with a local auctioneering company.",

A year later, he competed in the pairs with Miss J. Ricketts, and their combined age was just 29. Later that year, Tomlins took part in the Olympic trials and, despite being the youngest male competitor, gave one of the finest performances seen by a skater on British ice, which virtually secured his place at the 1936 Games. He took part in the first of four European Championships in the Olympic year, and in 1937 made his début at the World Championships. Having finished no better than fourth in either championship, he then enjoyed a memorable year in 1939, when he was runner-up to Graham Sharp in both Championships. It was the first time, in both, that British men had finished first and second and, as of 2018, that remained the case. Tomlins’ father was secretary of the Streatham Speed Skating Club, and Freddie became a very talented speed skater, winning titles in the UK and Australia, including the 1938 New South Wales quarter-mile title.

Instead Colón competed at the Friendship Games, a replacement games held by the Soviet Union and other Socialist countries that had boycotted the 1984 Olympics, where she won a bronze medal. She missed her second Olympics due to another boycott in 1988. Colón won the Pan American Games in 1979 and 1983, taking silver in 1987.

3582,Manfred Wolke,Male,14 January 1943,176.0,67, East Germany,GDR,"Welterweight boxer Manfred Wolke won the gold medal for East Germany at the Mexico Olympics in 1968, by beating Joseph Bessala from Cameroon in the final, by a 4-1 decision. Four years later, Wolke was his country’s flagbearer at the opening ceremony but, sadly, did not retain his title after suffering a defeat in round three, when the referee stopped the fight after Wolke suffered an eyebrow injury against the Cuban Emilio Correa, who went on to win the gold medal. Wolke retired immediately after the Games. Wolke won the East German welterweight title in 1967-70, and in 1971 was the light-middleweight champion. Shortly after his retirement from the ring, Wolke started a very successful coaching career, and coached some well-known boxers, including Rudi Fink, Henry Maske, Axel Schulz and Danilo Häußler.",
