He was known for his mosaics and graphics, which were often characterized by geometric lines and influenced by antiquity. His daughter Simone (*1946) also became a recognized artist. In his youth he was an avid sportsman (hockey, ski jumping and cross country). Initially, he was trained as a surveyor and worked as an architectural draftsman. When his striking talent for drawing became obvious, he attended the Kunstgewerbeschule (Arts and Crafts School) Luzern in 1927-28. He completed his studies in Paris - at the Académie Julian - and in Berlin. From 1932-34 he lived in Paris, where he was influenced by Braque and Picasso and met artists like Kandinsky, Mondrian and Henry Moore. There, he ran a second studio for several decades in addition to the one in Luzern. Later, Erni worked as a painter, sculptor, graphic artist and ceramist. He created about 90 stamp issues for the Swiss post office, the United Nations, and for Liechtenstein, and illustrated about 200 non-fiction books, encyclopedias and literary works. Because he was a follower of Marxism, he had problems in the 1940s with being accepted in Switzerland. In the 1950s, he made several trips around the world. After the suppression of the Hungarian Revolution in 1956, however, he dissociated himself from Marxism and became more concerned with ecological themes. One of the most popular Swiss artists, in his home town of Lucerne, he was accorded his own museum. He was 106 years old when he died in 2015. In 1944, a new edition of the Olympiques by the Roman poet Pindar with illustrations by Hans Erni was published in Lausanne in a limited edition of only 318 copies. Each copy was signed by the artist and the publisher. The edition was created to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the revival of the Olympic Games. The ten sheets in the format 20 x 26.5 cm and the 164 pages were garnered in a folder. The studies for murals, referred to in the catalog as Turner I und II (Gymnast I and II), are probably the paintings Athlete and Two Athletes, created in 1948. Erni produced them in tempera on paper in the format of about 130 x 100 cm. However, it is unclear why they were assigned to the arts and crafts section of the 1948 Art Competitions. For unknown reasons, his participation is not mentioned in the Swiss report on the country’s participation in the London Olympics.",Husband of Gertrude Bohnert Brother-in-law of Walter Strebi Listed in Olympians Who Reached the Age of 100 ()

Sumarokov-Elston started as a right-handed player but surgery on that hand rendered him unable to play well, and thus he switched to playing left-handed. Sumarokov-Elston was born into Russian nobility before the Bolshevik Revolution and had a privileged life until that time. He studied at Annenschule and then graduated with a law degree from St. Petersburg University. Sumarokov-Elston served in the ambulance fleet on the Black Sea during World War I but was invalided out of the service in 1916. He immigrated out of Russia in 1919, during the Revolution, settling in Nice in 1920, where he lived until 1937, after which he lived out his life in London. Because of his fortune, Sumarokov-Elston was able to play many Continental international championships. He was a five-time Russian singles champion (1910-14), also winning one doubles title and two mixed doubles titles. He won city tournaments in Moskva in 1910 (singles and doubles) and St. Petersburg in 1912 and 1914. Sumarokov-Elston won the South of France Championship in 1920-22 and the Nice Championship in 1922.

A former Barrow Grammar School student, he won the 2-mile open handicap event at a meeting in Barrow-in-Furness in 1944. He was just 16-years-of-age at the time, and won from a field of 23 men older than himself. He won the Northern Counties Junior Mile Championship in 1946 and later that year, after going to Liverpool University, took up cross-country running and competed in the UAU (University Athletic Union) Cross-Country Championship. In 1947, he was the surprise winner of the mile race at the UAU Challenge Cup meeting at Motspur Park. Later that year Parker finished second in the County Championships mile race, representing Lancashire. Parker was one the original of 147 athletes penciled in for the Great Britain squad for the 1948 Olympics and, less than a month before the start of the Games, he was on standby for the 1,500 metres if Doug Wilson failed a fitness test, which he didn’t, and Parker was omitted. After two good seasons in 1951 and 1952, however, he was back in contention for the British Olympic team for Helsinki. In the 1951 AAA mile, won in record time by Roger Bannister, Parker set the pace for the first three laps. A month later, Parker moved up to three miles and finished third in the British Games at White City, and a further four weeks after that, finished second to Bill Nankeville in The City Mile, in the first British athletics meeting under floodlights, again at the White City. Parker won the 1952 Lancashire 3-mile title, was third in the County Championship 3-miles behind Gordon Pirie and Frank Sando, and was second to Chris Chataway in the AAA 3-miles. Chataway, Pirie and Parker were all selected for the 5,000 metres at the Helsinki Olympics where Parker finished second in his heat and was the fastest of the three Britons. In the final, however, he was nearly 19 seconds slower and finished 11th. A Civil Servant, Parker won Civil Service 1- and 5-mile titles on several occasions and in 1953 was back to winning ways on the cross-country circuit, winning the North-Western senior title by more than 80 seconds.

Oganisyan took up wrestling in 1971 and, after winning gold at both the 1978 European Junior Championships and 1979 World Junior Championships, he entered the ranks of seniors in 1980 by winning the European title. He entered the 1980 Olympics as a favorite for freestyle light-heavyweight gold and did not disappoint, winning the title. After the Olympics, Oganisyan continued his golden streak by winning the 1981 World title and the 1981 World Cup, but then seriously injured his back at the start of 1982. It took nearly two years for Oganisyan to recover from that injury, but in 1984 he qualified for the Soviet Olympic team, missing the Games due to the Soviet boycott. Instead, he competed at the Friendship Games and won gold as light-heavyweight,also winning the World Cup that year. Oganisyan earned his second European title in 1986, but then re-injured his back and again missed several seasons. After recovering from injury, Oganisyan attempted another comeback, this time as a heavyweight, but with less success, as he did not qualify for the 1988 Soviet Olympic team, although he did win silver at the 1989 World Cup. Domestically, Oganisyan won only two Soviet titles: in 1981 in light-heavyweight and in 1989 in heavyweight. Oganisyan retired from sports after the fall of the Soviet Union.",

Daan, a police officer, pursued boxing and competed for his force as an amateur, winning his first heavyweight title in 1952. He lost it the following year, but regained it in 1955 and held it for five consecutive years through 1959. The 1956 Summer Olympic heavyweight tournament was his first international match as a representative from South Africa, but he nevertheless succeeded in taking home the bronze medal (shared with the Italian Mino Bozzano), defeating José Giorgetti after a bye, but losing to eventual gold medalist Pete Rademacher. Bekker then travelled to Cardiff, Wales in 1958 to represent South Africa at that year’s British Empire and Commonwealth Games. There he won the gold medal in the heavyweight boxing tournament with victories against S. Renaud of Canada, eventual bronze medalist Gbadegesin Salawu of Nigeria, and Dave Thomas of England in the final bout. As a prelude to the 1960 Summer Olympics he represented South Africa against a touring Irish boxing delegation. At the Olympic tournament he knocked out Władysław Jędrzejewski in his first bout, followed by Obrad Sretenović in the first round of their quarter-final match, and then defeated eventual bronze medalist Günter Siegmund in the semi-finals. In the final round he was knocked out by Franco De Piccoli in 90 seconds and finished the competition with a silver medal. He turned professional in November 1961 and won or drew his first five fights, including two South African heavyweight title bouts.

He repeated in 1971, also winning the 200, which made him a medal favorite at the 1972 Olympics. Two of his biggest rivals, Americans Eddie Hart and Rey Robinson, were eliminated when they missed their quarter-final heats due to an error reading the schedule. Borzov also nearly missed his quarter-final, having dozed off and arriving on the track just in time to kneel down for the start. Borzov eventually won the final with relative ease. The Americans vowed revenge for the 200 metres, but Borzov held off all contenders and won in a European Record of 20 seconds flat. Borzov again made the news at the 1976 Olympics, but not for athletic reasons. Ukrainian immigrants in Canada spread the rumour that Borzov would leave the Soviet team in Montréal and ask for political asylum. After this was widely reported in the media, Borzov received anonymous phone calls threatening he would be shot during the 100 final (in which Borzov eventually placed third). Borzov also medaled in the 4x100 at both of those Olympics, winning silver in 1972 and bronze in 1976. Borzov tried for a third Olympics in 1980, but injuries forced him to retire from sports in 1979. At the European Championships, besides his three titles in 1969 and 1971, Borzov won another 100 title in 1974 and 4x100 silver in 1969. He won seven 60 metre titles at the European Indoors (1970-72 and 1974-77), a record that will likely never be equaled as the event is no longer held annually. He also won 100 and 4x100 relay golds at the 1975 European Cup. Borzov won 16 Soviet titles – 100 in 1969, 1971-72 and 1974-77; 200 in 1971-75 and 1977; and 4x100 relay 1974-75 and 1977. In 1977 Borzov married the quadruple Olympic gymnastics champion Lyudmila Turishcheva and later had a successful career in politics and sport administration. From 1980-90, he was deputy chairman of the State Committee for Sports and Physical Culture of the Ukrainian SSR. In 1987 Borzov was elected to the European Athletics Association (EAA) and in 1990 he became first president of the Ukrainian NOC, serving in that position until 1998. From 1990-97 Borzov was first Minister of Youth and Sports of Ukraine and from 1998-06, was with the Verkhovna Rada, the Ukrainian parliament, and was the chairman of Verkhovna Rada’s Committee on Youth Policy, Physical Culture, Sports and Tourism from 1998-02.

Lillian Copeland won a total of nine AAU titles between 1925 and 1932 in three different events – shot, discus, and javelin – and in 1926 she took all three championships setting a new U.S. record in each event. After the 1928 Olympics, Copeland entered Southern Cal Law School and did not compete seriously again until 1931. The following year she finished third in the discus at the Final Trials and barely made the Olympic team, but at the Games she came up with a new Olympic record of 133-2 (40.59) on her last throw and snatched the gold medal from Ruth Osborn, who had led the field going into the last round. The 27-year-old Copeland was then the oldest U.S. woman to have won an Olympic gold medal in track & field events. In 1935 she came out of retirement and won three gold medals in her specialty events at the Second World Maccabiah Games in Palestine. During the seasons 1926-28 Lillian Copeland broke the world javelin record three times and set two world records for the 8 lb. shot put. The shot put was not included in the women’s program at the Games until 1948, which almost certainly deprived her of further Olympic honors. For a specialist in throwing events, she had a surprising turn of speed and in February 1928, she was a member of the team from the Pasadena A&CC that set a new U.S. record of 50.0 for the 440y relay.

He was a dashing left-back with a strong volley, and the powerful use of his left foot was always a feature of his game. Smith attended Oxford County School and Beccles School, and began his playing career with Witney Town FC, winning the Oxfordshire Senior Cup three times in the early 1890’s.

12660,Bill Roycroft,Male,17 March 1915,188.0,72, Australia,AUS,"Bill Roycroft was born on a cattle farm in the foothills of Australia’s Great Dividing Range. After leaving school at the age of 14 he worked in a succession of jobs, – as a breaker of wild horses, rabbit trapper, bicycle messenger, fruit packer, sheep shearer and farm labourer, – until he joined the Australian Army on the outbreak of war. He saw wartime service in New Guinea and at the end of the war was given a grant of farmland by the Australian government. He bought horses to work the farm and began to compete at local equestrian events. Slowly he built up his string of horses and began to achieve success, first locally then at national level. Overlooked for the 1956 Games he was already 45 when he made his Olympic debut in Rome but what happened there made him a legend in Australian sport. The other three members of the Australian team had excelled on the cross-country phase of the three day event and filled the first three places in the individual event with only the show jumping phase to follow. The Aussies lead in the team event was so large that each of the three could knock every fence down and still win with ease. Rycroft however was in hospital after a crashing fall had left him with concussion, severe bruising and a broken collarbone. His Olympic Games was believed to be over. On the morning of the show jumping phase Brian Crago’s horse was found to be lame and, as three of the team had to finish the event to win a medal, Australia’s hope’s of a team medal appeared to be over. On hearing this news Roycroft, against medical orders, discharged himself from hospital and helped by a course of pain killing injections and a pint of beer. He was lifted by his teammates onto his horse and, with the use of only his left arm to control his horse, proceeded to jump a flawless round and ensure an Australian victory. Amazingly this was merely the start of Roycroft’s Olympic career and he competed at the next four celebrations winning two further bronze medals in the team event. His last medal, won on his final Games appearance in 1976, came when he was 61 years of age. The Roycroft family’s relationship with the Olympic Games was not restricted to Bill’s exploits and sons Wayne, Barry and James all competed alongside their father on Australian teams. Later Wayne’s wife Vicki also became an Olympian. In 2000 the 85 year old Bill Roycroft had the honour of being one of the eight great Australian champions to carry the Olympic flag at the opening ceremony of the Sydney Olympics.",Father-in-law of Vicki Roycroft Father of Barry Roycroft Father of Wayne Roycroft Father of James Roycroft Bearer of the Olympic Flag at the opening ceremony of the 2000 Summer Olympics

During the 1975 European Championships in Bern, he fled to the West with the help of West German gymnast Eberhard Gienger, who transported him in his private car across the border from Switzerland to West Germany.

53908,Les Ablett,Male,6 March 1904,,, Great Britain,GBR,"An inspector in the Liverpool police, Les Ablett died one month after completing 25 years’ service with the force. He came from a well-known family of Merseyside swimmers, and spent his early days in the baths close to his Birkenhead home with his older brother Charlie. Because he was more than 20 years older than Les, many thought that Charlie was his father. Charlie was secretary of the Birkenhead Swimming Club for over 40 years. Originally a swimmer, Les turned to water polo and won representative honours as a goaltender with Cheshire before going on to make 18 international appearances, including the 1927 European Championships at Bologna. Apart from two Olympic appearances, Ablett had some memorable moments in the sport. In 1922 he was in the Cheshire side that won the County Championship. Four years later, in 1926, he played in goal for Birkenhead when they beat the famous Hyde Seal club in the final of the Cheshire County Water Polo Championship. When they next won the title, 21 years later, Ablett was again the goaltender as history repeated itself when Birkenhead again beat Hyde. One of Ablett’s proudest moments, however, was probably in helping the Liverpool Police team win the 1931 County Championship. His career nearly came to an end in 1933 while attending a fire at a Liverpool grocer’s shop in his capacity as a police officer, as he fell 15-feet through a trap door and broke his collarbone. Ablett recovered, however, and continued playing for the police team until shortly before his untimely death at the age of 48.",

On one day at Battersea in 1927 he broke 10 records, which was dubbed as a “record of records” at the time. He was still breaking records in his mid-40s and in 1935, at the age of 45, Wood took part in the British championship, finishing second to Ron Walker, the man who had replaced Wood as champion in 1932. At the age of 10, Wood was a keen gymnast, and it was not until the age of 20 that he took up weightlifting, when he was introduced to the sport by the Swiss lifter Albert Soguel. Wood was also a keen wrestler before turning to weightlifting, and in January 1925 briefly returned to “grappling”. In his two Olympic appearances, Wood broke six Olympic records, four in 1924 and two in 1928. By profession, Wood was a rat catcher.",

Unfortunately for him, his career coincided with that of swimming megastar Michael Phelps, also an expert in the medleys. This has deprived Cseh of all but one international level title. At the Beijing Olympics, he won three silvers (all behind Phelps), and he has similarly won six World Championships medals (three silver, three bronze) in medley events behind Phelps. The only exception came when Phelps skipped the 400 IM at the 2005 worlds, allowing Cseh to claim the world title. Outside of the medley events, he has also done well in the butterfly (one silver at the Beijing Games) and the backstroke (bronze at the 2005 Worlds). In European championships, with Phelps not competing, Cseh has been dominant.

Although he fenced with all three weapons, he excelled in the sabre, winning the first two World Championships in the event (1922 and 1923) and four of his five Olympic medals. He was close to winning the gold medal in the 1924 Olympic sabre competition, and leading eventual champion Posta (HUN) by three hits when an audience member fell through his chair. This distracted the jury, who failed to see De Jong’s decisive hit. Disrupted, De Jong lost his bout and eventually finished fifth. Between 1910 and 1928, De Jong won 18 Dutch titles – a record number (épée: 9, sabre: 6, foil: 3). Although he did not compete in many events after the Amsterdam Olympics, he did win the épéé event at the Military World Championships in 1936.

She won her first German Championship in foil in 1924 when she was only 13, and by 1930, had been a six-time German Champion. In 1928 she won the Italian Championship and in 1929 and 1931 she won the European Foil Championships, the forerunner of the World Championships. In 1933 her club excluded her because she was “half Jewish”. Mayer left Germany at the time, because of their treatment of Jews, and settled in the United States, eventually winning the US foil title eight times (1934-35, 1937-39, 1941-42, and 1946). Competing for Germany she added a third World Title in 1937, when the event was called World Championships for the first time, and also won a silver medal with the German foil team. Mayer won the gold medal at the 1928 Amsterdam Olympics in the individual foil, came in fifth at the 1932 Los Angeles Games, and added another silver medal at the 1936 Berlin Olympics. After international discussions began about boycotting the 1936 Olympics, Germany offered her a place on the 1936 Olympic Team as their token Jewish athlete, and she was the only German Jewish participant at the 1936 Berlin Games. During the 1936 Olympics Mayer wore the German uniform with the Swastika, and after her silver medal, gave the Nazi Salute (Hitlergruß) on the podium, which earned her severe criticism from the world press, one of her hardest detractors being the writer Thomas Mann, who had fled to Switzerland in protest of Nazi policies, and would later settle in the USA. In 1952 Helene Mayer returned to Germany, settled in München, married Baron Falkner von Sonnenburg, dying only one year later from breast cancer. In 1968, the German Post issued a stamp in memoriam, and in 1963 she was inducted in the US Fencing Hall of Fame.","Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the World Fencing Championships (3–1–0 1929 Napoli gold: foil; 1931 Wien gold: foil; 1937 Paris gold: foil, silver: foil team)"

920503,John Lavery,Male,20 March 1856,,, Great Britain  Ireland,GBR,"Sir John Lavery was an Irish-born Scottish painter of portraits and landscapes. In the early 1880s he joined the Académie Julian at Paris but returned to Glasgow in 1888, where he was associated with the Glasgow School. A car accident during a bombing raid prevented him from an active role in WWI. His paintings during that time were dominated by boats, airships and plane motifs. After being knighted in 1913 he was elected to the Royal Academy in 1921. He participated in three consecutive Olympic Games in the Art Competitions: 1924 (representing Ireland), and 1928 and 1932 (representing Great Britain). He and his second wife Hazel Martyn, also an artist later appearing on the banknotes of the Republic of Ireland, were involved in the Irish War of Independence and the Irish Civil War, as they had Irish roots. In the 1930s he returned to Ireland where he received honorary degrees from both the University of Dublin and the University of Belfast. Lavery finished the nearly life-size painting Stephen Donoghue in the King’s Colours in 1923 (oil on canvas, 181 x 103 cm) and apparently submitted it to the Olympic art competitions in both 1924 and 1928. In the early 1920s, he created a series of oil paintings in the milieu of horse racing and jockeys. These included Weighing Room, Hurst Park of 1924, in which apparently Donoghue is also depicted being weighed. The other figures were also well-known jockeys of the time. Hurst Park, the racecourse at West Molesey in Surrey closed in 1962. In 1931 Lavery painted the portrait of the Earl of Lonsdale K. G. in oil on canvas (66 x 42 cm). The painter described him as “the best paintable – not to say best dressed – Englishman I knew”. The painting had been commissioned by the city of Doncester, which the Earl had championed for development. Immediately afterwards, Lavery produced another portrait of the Earl, but in civilian clothes, free from the constraints of an official portrait. A completely different painting is Schooling the Pony (oil on canvas, 77 x 103 cm), painted in 1929, when Lavery was strongly concerned with horse themes. This was already evidenced by the works submitted in 1928. The painting was acquired in 1935 by Touchstones Rochdale Museum in Manchester.",Listed in Olympian Members of the Nobility (Sir)

He played tennis at the 1912 Stockholm Olympics, but the story gets complicated after that. Fuchs family took the name Robětín in about June 1919 and he was usually known thereafter as Karl Ludwig Robětín. Robětín became secretary of the Czechoslovakia Lawn Tennis Federation in 1921 and was its President from 1929-38. He was chairman of the tennis club ICLTK Stavanice in Prague and a member of the Czechoslovakia Olympic Committee. Fuchs was a paper industrialist who became chairman of the Economic Association of Paper Industry in Praha, where he was also chairman of the Technical Museum. He also served as the Belgian Consul in Praha. Robětín later also took up ice hockey as a sport and played for several years with Praha CLTK. His son, Robert Robětín, became quite good at ice hockey and played for that club, Kladno TJ Sokol SONP, and Dynamo Karlovy Vary from 1937-58. Robětín was Jewish, but was an ethnic German. In 1938 he left Czechoslovakia for London, where he moved to avoid being arrested by the Germans. His wife and one of his sons were killed at Auschwitz in 1942. Robětín spent his time in England involved with the piano and his music. The story gets a bit complicated when one realizes that many sources say that Robětín also played tennis at the 1920 Olympics, but under the name Karel Ardelt. Our research indicates this is not true, and that there were two different Bohemian tennis players named Karel. In fact, both were entered in the singles in 1912 at Stockholm, but Karel Ardelt did not play. Further, there are 1912 Olympic entry forms for both players in the Stockholm Riksarchivet. The confusion arises partly because their birthdates are very close – three days apart. Further confirmation that there were two such persons comes from Bohemian family conscription forms, which document the two different families, and some newspaper articles on the 1921 Davis Cup match against Belgium, in which Ardelt played, but the story was sent to the newspaper by Robětín, and it specifically mentions both names. We also know of the wives and descendants of both athletes and they are not the same, and we have spoken to Karel Fuchs-Robětín grandson, Petr Robětín. Sources calling Karel Ardelt and Karel Fuchs-Robětín the same person are in error.",

On the death of his brother in 1967, Charles became the 6th Baronet Gladstone of Fasque and Balfour but chose to never to use the title, preferring to be called Mr. Charles Andrew Gladstone instead.

They were denied entry into the United States but were allowed to continue on to Cuba where they lived until they finally got permission to enter the United States in December. The two brothers adopted the more American names of Alexander and Edward, attended public schools, were accepted at Rutgers University, and fenced for Salle Santelli. Their father, Angelo Treves, had fenced for Italy, finishing second in team sabre at the 1934 World Championships. Both brothers fenced for Rutgers’ 1948 NCAA team with Edward fencing foil and Alex fencing sabre but both were eliminated in the preliminary round. Alex went on to also make Rutgers’ 1949 and 1950 NCAA teams, winning the individual sabre championship both years, which helped Rutgers win the team title in 1949 and place second in 1950. Treves competed in team sabre at the 1952 Helsinki Olympics. He won three team sabre titles at the Amateur Fencers League of America (AFLA) Championships in 1952 and 1955-56.

He filed for a Swiss passport, but this required him to live in Switzerland for five years. In the meantime, the Chinese wouldn’t let him compete for China. After numerous Swiss national titles, he could finally enter an international event in 1994. At that year’s World Championships, he finished third in his favorite event, the pommel horse. He improved the following year and won the world title in the same event at the Worlds in Sabae, Japan. At the Centennial Olympics in Atlanta, he finally made his Olympic debut.

920937,Tadao Harumura,Male,7 July 1901,,, Japan,JPN,"Japanese Tadao Harumura lived in the port town of Kobe in Japan and was one of the leading woodcut artists there before World War II. The focus of his woodblock prints was on landscapes and nudes. Harumura was born as Tadao Tanabe close to the picturesque Kujūkuri Beach on the east coast of Honshu Island. After finishing high school, he enrolled at the Kwansei Gakuin University in Nishinomiya close to Kobe, where he met printmaker Imazō Kitamura and started producing prints. His first exhibitions came in 1922 with the Japanese Creative Prints Association and he became a regular participant in their exhibitions. In the same year, he dropped out of university. Between 1927 and 1931 he published a first series of collections of woodcuts dealing, for instance, with the architecture of the city of Kobe (Kobe landscape) or with nude drawings (Spring), which played a significant role in the history of creative printmaking. With Hide Kawanishi and Imazō Kitamura, Harumura founded the artist association Sanko-kai in 1929 and illustrated stories in popular magazines. In 1936 he donated a considerable number of his works, including the two prints shown at the 1936 Berlin art competition, to the Kobe City Central Library. While working in a liver oil factory in 1938, Harumura sustained a serious injury that forced him to abandon printmaking. During an air raid on Kobe in 1945 all of his works, woodblocks, and all other materials were destroyed, and he never recovered as an artist. While he worked in a munition factory in Osaka, his family was evacuated to Kuwana near Nagoya. After the end of the war, they all returned to his hometown of Shirako, where he started working in the village office. He later worked for the local welfare division as a pension clerk and eventually in a school canteen. Harumura donated his two submitted works along with others to the Kobe Central Library in 1936. Aisuhokkē (sen) (Ice Hockey (Fight)) was a color woodblock print measuring 29 x 35 cm, created in 1935/36.

Born into a wealthy family, he attended English Medhurst College in Shanghai. Already well known in sports circles after placing second in the 200 m hurdles at the 1930 national championships, he then enrolled in the Department of Economics of the Soochow University. Cheng was a member of the Jiangsu branch of the All-China Sports Federation and vice chairman of the Suzhou Athletics Association. He represented China in the Far East Games in 1930 and 1934. In 1934, he ran 10.6 seconds in the 100 m during an unofficial competition, one tenth faster than Liu’s national record. In the Chinese trials, he failed to qualify in the dash and entered the 400 m hurdles instead. In this event, he immediately broke the national record with a time of 58.3 and qualified. Additional support by his classmate Chiang Wei-kuo, the adopted son of Kuomintang leader Chiang Kai-shek and funds from the former Minister of Education allowed Cheng to join the Chinese team at the 1936 Berlin Olympics. There, he competed in the 100 and 200 m dash and in 4 x 100 m relay but failed to advance to the second round in either event. While in Berlin, he acquired an eye disease and had to be hospitalized. His active career was stopped by the second Sino-Japanese War.

In winter 1928 the related ice rink was opened, where prominent figure skaters such as World and European Champions Karl Schäfer and Fritzi Burger showed their skills. Moreover, hockey games, art shows, and public contests were held almost every night. In the style of New Objectivity, the elongated street front of the cubic structure was structured by windows. The facade had a warm sandy tone and was decorated with reliefs from painter and sculptor Heinrich Révy. The mechanical core was a crystal ice factory that produced fifteen hundred blocks of ice daily, while the waste heat heated the water in the pool. Meanwhile, the bath has been renovated and modernized several times. Tamussino’s second contribution was his design for a “municipal bath and laundry in the Wiener Neustadt”, which was developed for a competition in 1928 but never realized.",

Doris was a theatrical costume and set designer, painter, commercial artist and writer, while Anna was a painter and muralist. Both sisters painted murals for the passenger liners Queen Mary and Queen Elizabeth, and both were official war artists during World War II. At age 16, Doris painted Anna’s portrait, which hung in the Royal Academy Exhibition in 1918. Doris was a gold, silver and bronze medal winner at the Paris Salon. She was also an excellent show jumper and competed at many major shows, winning the Supreme Hack Championship at the International Horse of the Year show at Olympia in 1934. Doris’ work included three days at the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp in 1945, shortly after liberation. The memories of Bergen-Belsen affected her and gave her nightmares for the rest of her life. Both sisters also worked as auxiliary nurses during the war. During World War II she was the official War artist for the St. John’s Ambulance Brigade. For her services during the War she was made a Serving Sister of the Order of St. John in 1945 and that same year she designed the Royal Air Force Christmas card. During the war she designed costumes for Old Vic productions Richard III and Arms and the Man starring Ralph Richardson, Laurence Olivier and Margaret Rutherford. Doris was a very popular society painter, her paintings depicting the lifestyle of the upper class. She trained at the Royal Academy Schools and exhibited her work in London, Paris and the United States. In addition to painting, Doris had a very successful career as a costume and set designer for the theatre and the newly emerging British film industry. She thus became acquainted with some of the great personalities of the inter-war years. She also produced a range of commercial art, including posters for London Transport in 1939. In the 1920s Doris dated and was reportedly engaged to the film director James Whale, known for horror films such as Frankenstein, as well as for his homosexuality. She eventually married naval officer Edward Grahame Johnstone in 1927 and had twin daughters and a son. The twins Janet and Anne Johnstone later became children’s book illustrators.

Until World War II, he frequently traveled throughout Europe, Asia, America and North Africa. In World War II he fought on the Eastern Front and was taken prisoner by the Russians. His early literary works were novels and short stories, including the fantastic story Klas der Fisch (Claus the fish), which was his entry for the 1936 art competitions. It tells the adventures of a hybrid between man and sea creature. One of his early successes as a stage writer was Der Flieger (The Airman). After World War II, he focussed on dramatic works.",

A week earlier Ken had won the Midland Counties steeplechase title, in the rain at Bromsgrove, and in doing so broke the 26-year-old record. His performances earned him a call up to the British team for the Helsinki Olympics but he was eliminated after finishing seventh in his opening heat. Replacing the injured John Disley for the international against France in 1953 Ken then went on to capture the AAA title in 1954 when he held on to win by half-a-yard from the Hungarian László Jeszenszky who made a brave effort to catch Johnson after stumbling at the water jump earlier in the race.

He set 17 world records between 1935 and 1944 and none of his backstroke records were broken until 1950, four years after he had retired from competitive swimming. Indoors and outdoors he won a total of 18 AAU titles in the backstroke, the freestyle, and the IM, but the backstroke was clearly his forté. Kiefer attended the University of Texas prior to the World War II. During the War, Kiefer conducted a survey of shipwrecks and documented the toll of GI deaths from drowning. As a result, Lieutenant Kiefer was put in charge of swimming instruction for the entire US Navy. While in the Navy he studied the various lifesaving devices, including life jackets and buoys, which later led to him forming his own company with various subsidiaries, Adolph Kiefer & Associates, all involved in the manufacture of swimming pool accessories and swim-related items. His company was often a supplier for the US Olympic team and at the Olympic Games.

Despite having a preference for the one mile, he was also very adept at all distances up to 10 miles. Bacon was also a keen cross-country runner, and even enjoyed the steeplechase. Bacon started running in the Manchester area shortly after joining the Army and finished third in his first race at Macclesfield in 1890. The winner of several Army races, he went on to win the AAA one-mile title three years running 1893-95, and when he won it in the third of those years, he did so in a world amateur record 4:17.0, knocking 0.8 seconds off the Irish-American Tommy Conneff’s record. Conneff reclaimed the record, however, seven weeks later. Bacon also won the AAA 4 miles in 1894 and the 10 miles in 1895. That would be Bacon’s last chance of any further AAA glory because shortly before the 1896 Championships, Bacon, along with sprinters Charles Bradley and Alfred Downer, and two other distance runners George Crossland and Harry Watkins, were all banned for breaking the AAA code of amateur rules. Having turned professional, Bacon put in some amazing performances and in October 1896 he beat Conneff over one, two, and three miles. In 1897 Bacon broke the Indigenous American Deerfoot’s 34-year-old record for the one hour run when he added 273 yards to Deerfoot’s record of 11 miles 970 yards. Bacon was scheduled to compete in two professional races at the 1900 Paris Olympics, but was a non-starter in both the 1,500 and 5,000 metres. Bacon served 12 years with the 3rd Battalion Manchester Regiment until his discharge in November 1898, although he remained on the Reserve List. On 27 January 1903, Bacon was appointed trainer at Manchester United FC and with him he brought massage techniques never seen before in English football. He also brought the players up to the stamina levels required to be a top footballer. United were languishing in the second tier of English football and still awaiting their first major honour. Within five years of joining United, however, they had won the English League title for the first time, and by the time his contract was severed at the end of the 1911-12 season, they had won two League titles, and the FA Cup in 1909. Being a reservist, Bacon was recalled to the Army during World War I and was sent to Lincolnshire as part of the defence of the River Humber. He settled on the east coast, at Cleethorpes, where he set up a masseur and chiropody business in the town.",

Dumbadze was born in Ukraine to a Georgian family and took up athletics in 1935. At first Dumbadze competed in jump and sprint events and took up the discus throw in 1937, when her family moved back to Georgia and she met her future coach and husband Boris Diachk’ovi. Soon Dumbadze rose to be the top female Soviet discus thrower and in 1939 bettered the world record of 48.31 held by German Gisela Mauermayer by throwing 49.11 in Moskva at the 1939 Soviet Championships. This result was never ratified as a world record as the Soviet Union was not a member of the IAAF at the time. During World War II, Dumbadze constantly bettered Mauermayer’s world record and in late August 1946, a week after the 1946 European Championships, Dumbadze became the first woman to throw over 50 metres when she threw 50.50 in Sarpsborg, Norway. This result was not ratified by the IAAF either and Dumbadze threw her first official world record in August 1948 when she threw 53.25 in Moskva, bettering Mauermayer’s world record by nearly five meters. Dumbadze threw two more official world records during her career – in May 1951 in Gori, Georgia (then part of the Soviet Union) she threw 53.37, and then late in her career, when she was thought to be well past her prime, Dumbadze threw 57.04 in Tbilisi, bettering the then standing world record of 53.61 held by Nina Romashkova by more than three meters. Internationally, Dumbadze was the 1946 and 1950 European Champion and also won gold at the 1949 World Student Games. Dumbadze competed at the 1952 Olympics, where she was the clear favorite for the gold medal, but won only bronze behind compatriots Romashkova and Yelizaveta Bagryantseva to complete the first ever medal sweep by a nation in women’s track & field athletics. Dumbadze won eight Soviet titles (1939, 1943-44, 1946-50). After finishing her sports career, Dumbadze worked as an athletics coach alongside her husband, who was head coach of the Georgian SSR national athletics team for nearly 50 years.

However, the British trio went on to win the bronze medal. Although born in England, Nicoll grew up in Ceylon (now Sri Lanka), but was educated in England at Marlborough School. After leaving Marlborough in 1926, he went to the Royal Military Academy at Woolwich, and was commissioned into the Royal Artillery in 1928. This heralded the start of a 22-year military career that saw him attain the rank of lieutenant-colonel. Nicoll served in Singapore prior to the outbreak of World War II, and subsequently saw active service in Egypt, Algiers, Sicily, and in the Italian campaign. He returned to Britain, and in 1945 was awarded the OBE for gallant and distinguished service in the Mediterranean Theatre. Nicoll was offered a posting at Eastern Command headquarters in 1948, but declined as he wanted to concentrate on his equestrian career, following show jumping successes in Austria and Switzerland. In the 10 years between 1946 and 1956, Nicoll regularly represented the Great Britain show jumping team and also competed at Badminton. As a horseman Nicoll was an experienced show jumper, polo player, point-to-pointer and steeplechase jockey, and in 1935 his horse Somnus was entered for the Aintree Grand National, but sustained an injury and had to withdraw. After his riding career, Nicoll went into coaching British youngsters, and also designed and built three-day-event courses. He was also a former chairman of the Pony Club Horse Trials committee, and because of his course designing skills, served on the committee of the Burghley Horse Trials from 1973-90, when he was appointed vice-president.

Bailey also finished ninth at the 1954 British Empire and Commonwealth Games 880 yards. He then came to the United States to run at the University of Oregon, where he mostly moved up the 1,500/Mile. He won the 1955 NCAA Championship in the mile and was second in 1956, over 1,500 metres. But he ran the 800 metres at the 1956 Olympics and did not advance out of the semi-finals. Bailey was ranked #3 in the world for the 1,500/Mile in 1956. In May of that year, a special mile race was run in conjunction with the USC-UCLA dual meet at the Los Angeles Coliseum, featuring John Landy. Bailey was supposed to be a rabbit for Landy during that race, but he held on to his shoulder and moved past him on the final lap to win in 3:58.6. This was the first 4-minute mile run on US soil. Bailey returned to Australia and played professional rugby for a bit. But he later returned to the United States and lived in the Pacific Northwest for the rest of his life, initially working as a manufacturer’s rep in sportswear in Kirkland, Washington. He later moved to Bellingham, Washington where he sold real estate. Personal Bests: 800 – 1:48.8 (1956); 1500 – 3:43.3 (1956); Mile – 3:58.6 (1956).",

He was a Scottish international, represented Great Britain more than 50 times between 1965-76, and was team captain twice in the 1970s. He appeared in the Olympics and at two Commonwealth Games and European Championships. As a youngster, Piggot was both a fine sprinter and rugby player but was involved in a bad car accident after leaving school and spent six months out of action. He eventually returned to both sports and at the 1962 Rangers Sports and Glasgow Police meetings he enjoyed wins, which was the first notification that a successful sprinting career was about to unfold. Between 1964 and 1976 Piggot won 14 medals at the Scottish Championships. His last title was the 100 metres in 1976 when he beat the future Olympic champion Allan Wells. Piggot never won a national AAA title, but was runner-up to Bob Frith in the 60 yards at the 1967 Indoor Championships. He was then runner-up to Ron Green in the 100 metres at the senior AAAs in 1971, and Green was ahead of Piggot again when he finished third in both 1972 and 1973. He came close at the indoors in 1976 when runner-up again, this time to Chris Monk. In his only Olympic appearance, at München in 1972, Piggot was eliminated in the quarter-finals in a 100 metres heat won by the eventual champion, Valery Borzov. In the sprint relay, Piggot and the Great Britain quartet were eliminated at the semi-final stage. Piggot competed in the 1970 and 1974 British Commonwealth Games and was the only Briton to appear in the final of the 100 metres at both Edinburgh and Christchurch, finishing eight and seventh respectively, and fourth and fifth with the relay squads. Piggot again came close to an international medal at the 1971 European Championships in Helsinki, but finished an unfortunate fourth in the relay, with the same time as bronze medallists Italy. Piggot married fellow sprinter Morag Carmichael in 1968 and their son, Les junior, was also a sprinter and finished third in the 100 metres at the 1986 Lanarkshire Championships. For relaxation, Piggot enjoyed sailing with his family. Despite being an international athlete, Piggot maintained his roots and competed at club meetings and Highland Games in his native Scotland, where he was famous for enjoying a cigarette in between races.

After serving in the Canadian Army from 1943 through 1945, he quickly returned to form and qualified for 1948 Winter Olympics in six events: the downhill, the slalom, and the combined in alpine skiing, the 18 kilometers in cross-country skiing, the individual in Nordic combined, and the normal hill, individual in ski jumping. This meant that he missed only one individual event at the Games, the 50 kilometer cross-country ski. Despite his versatility, however, his best finish was 36th in the alpine combined competition. Coming up short at the Olympics, however, does not diminish his accomplishments, as he won over 200 trophies across all of the skiing disciplines, nationally and internationally, until his retirement from active competition in 1955. Irwin began skiing at the age of nine, influenced by his father Bert “Pop” Irwin, who was manager of the Amber Ski Club and builder of Canada’s first cable-handle rope tow in 1934. Bill’s career was a winning one from start to finish: he won his first “Potato Race” in 1930 and his last “Over the Hill Downhill” in 1983. Outside of competition he taught Scottish Commandos how to ski and founded the Loch Lomond Ski Area and Club near Thunder Bay, Ontario. He was awarded the Ontario Tourism Award in 1975 for his promotion of skiing, and was inducted into the Canadian Ski Hall of Fame in 2000. His son Dave became an Olympic skier himself (1976 and 1980) and was a member of the Crazy Canucks, a group of Canadians who, during the 1970s and 1980s, gained a reputations as fast and reckless skiers.",Brother of Bert Irwin Father of Dave Irwin

As a weak and sickly child, she started to exercise Xingyiquan, a Chinese martial art, at the age of nine. Li Sen attended the middle school in Hengyang when she first excelled in track and field, repeatedly winning the sprint events at the school sports meetings. Starting in 1930, she regularly participated in the Hunan Provincial Games setting her first national records in the 200 m and in the long jump. In 1933, Li Sen was “specially recruited” to enter the Daotian Women’s Normal School, where she was trained to become a teacher. Due to her regular training, she was tanned and often called the “dark girl”. After only one year at the Daotian School, she was admitted to the Women’s Physical Education Teacher’s College of Shanghai Southeast University, from where she graduated in 1936. In 1935, when Li Sen participated in the 6th National Games, she not only won the women’s 50 m, 100 m and 200 m sprint championships and placed second place in the long jump, but also broke three national records. That earned her the name of the “Running Queen” and the year 1935 was proclaimed the “Li Sen Year” by the sports world. She was recommended for the Chinese team at the 1936 Olympics, but because her family was not well off, the trip was sponsored by a Shanghai lawyer. But like most members of the team, Li Sen also suffered from the long journey and the unfamiliar conditions and finished last in her heat. In the spring of 1937, Li Sen was hired as a sports coach by the Hunan National Martial Arts Center. After internal controversies, she moved to Chengdu to work as a sports teacher at the No. 1 Middle School. One year later, she married a pilot and gave birth to her second child in 1942, but died of postpartum loss of blood at the age of 28.

He quickly rose through the ranks and in 1950 was chosen to compete for Australia at the British Empire Games in New Zealand where he won the silver medal in the individual foil behind René Paul of England. The following year Fethers created a little piece of history by becoming the first man to win all three weapons at the Australian national championships. After these successes it was inevitable that he should be picked for Australia’s inaugural Olympic fencing team for 1952 in all available disciplines and in Helsinki he reached the second phase of competition in both Épée and Foil. Fethers’ second British Empire Games proved more successful as he returned home from Vancouver in 1954 having repeated the silver medal foil performance of 1950 and added bronze in the individual sabre and three team medals (silver and two bronze) to his haul. That same year of 1954 brought more success as won the British Open and reached the semi-finals of the World Championships. He became the first Australian to reach the final pool at a World Championships in 1955 but was unable to travel back to Australia for the selection matches and was overlooked for a place at the Melbourne Games. Towards the end of the decade he decided to turn professional but his Olympic career did not come to an end as he was a coach for the Australian team in Tokyo and later became national head coach. In addition to being a fencing master Fethers also worked in the movies choreographing swordfights and appearing as a stunt double in fencing scenes. John Fethers had the following podium finishes at major championships: 2nd in the 1950 British Empire Games Foil Individual, 2nd in the 1954 British Empire and Commonwealth Games Foil Individual, 2nd in the 1954 British Empire and Commonwealth Games Foil Team (with Ivan Lund and Roderick Steele), 3rd in the 1954 British Empire and Commonwealth Games Sabre Individual, 3rd in the 1954 British Empire and Commonwealth Games Sabre Team (with Ivan Lund, Roderick Steele, and the non-Olympian Laurence Smith), 3rd in the 1954 British Empire and Commonwealth Games Épée Team (with Ivan Lund and the non-Olympian Laurence Smith).

He retired with the rank of colonel, and was at the time the Chief Inspector of Small Arms. Hopton’s hobby was music and he composed many popular waltzes of the day. One of his most popular compositions was “Ceylon Whispers”, which was often played by bands at the Bisley Camp and, on one occasion, at Buckingham Palace. Hopton was appointed a director of the Royal Academy of Music in 1922. Because of his love of match shooting on long-distance ranges, Hopton requested that, following his death, he be buried close to the 1500-yard firing point at the Canon Frome Rifle Range. The ground was specially consecrated by the Bishop of Hereford so his wish could be granted, and the Bishop also conducted the funeral service. Hopton had continued shooting competitively until the year before he died, when he was in his 75th year.",

Instead, Robertson entered the discus and finished fourth, his performance being described as “neither elegant nor successful.” His mark of 82-8 (25.19) is considered the inaugural UK record for the discus. Some sources suggest that Robertson also competed in the shot in Athinai, but the balance of the evidence suggests that this is unlikely, and The Field reported that “Robertson stood out of the weight putting, in which he might be presumed to have made a respectable appearance. Probably his time was too much occupied by the composition of his Greek ode.” As Robertson was the correspondent in Athinai for The Field he sent in this report himself. He did, however, play in the lawn tennis tournament, but his most notable achievement at the Games was to compose and recite a Pindaric ode in classical Greek before the King of Greece, for which he was rewarded with a laurel branch and subsequent investiture as a Knight if the Order of the Saviour of Greece. Although a keen Olympian, Robertson was not convinced, at least in his early years, of the value of the Olympic Movement as a peaceful influence. Writing in 1901 of the 1896 Games he expressed the view that “Politically, the Games undoubtedly did much to produce the subsequent war with Turkey.” Robertson was educated at Winchester before getting a scholarship to New College, Oxford. In 1899 he was called to the Bar by the Middle Temple and he joined the Oxford Circuit. He wrote various books about legal matters and proceedings and in 1907 he was appointed to the General Council of the Bar. In 1912 he was appointed the Chief Registrar of Friendly Societies and following the Industrial Assurance Act of 1923 he became the first Industrial Assurance Commissioner, a post he held until retiring from public life in 1937. He was knighted in 1928 and when he died, aged 94, he was the last surviving British competitor from the first Modern Olympic Games.

During that time he also played in one playoff game in 1960 with the International Hockey League’s Chatham Maroons and is therefore credited with an Allan Cup victory, given annually to the senior men’s ice hockey champions in Canada.

66139,Tom Longboat,Male,4 June 1887,175.0,66, Canada,CAN,"One of Canada’s most famed track and field athletes, Tom Longboat was a member of the Onondaga Nation of the country’s First Nations people. His first sport of choice was lacrosse, but he soon took up running and entered his first race in 1905, finishing second. From that point he began a string of victories, including one at the 1907 Boston Marathon, where he improved upon the course record by over five minutes. Both American and Canadian athletics organizations expressed qualms about his amateur status, but he was allowed to compete for Canada in the 1908 Olympic marathon, where he entered as the favorite, despite his club having to pay his way to London, since he was not selected officially by the Canadian Olympic Committee. He ran the first 20 miles of the 26.2 mile course but, while positioned in second place, he collapsed from exhaustion and failed to finish. Undeterred, by the end of 1908 Longboat had turned professional and, the following year, became World Champion. His career declined somewhat after this point, a deterioration that was aided by disputes with his managers, but he continued to win races and set records on a regular basis, including the 15-mile world record in 1912. In 1916 he signed up to serve his country during World War I and took advantage of his natural talents to act as a dispatch runner with the 107th Pioneer Battalion. He was wounded twice, but survived the conflict and came back to Canada in 1919, only to find that his wife had married another man upon hearing erroneous reports of his death overseas. By the time of his return, professional racing was a dying spectator sport and soon he found himself working odd jobs and living in Toronto until his 1944 retirement. Among these occupations was a stint with the Veterans Guard near Brantford, Ontario during World War II. He died in 1949 and, two years later, the Tom Longboat Award was inaugurated “to reward excellence in sport and physical activity among First Nations athletes”. He is also a member of Canada’s Sport, the Ontario Sports, and the Canadian Indian Halls of Fame, and, since 2008, June 4 in Canada has been known as “Tom Longboat Day”.

He led them to the 1950 World Championship and helped them win silver medals at the 1951 and 1955 Pan American Games. Furlong was even courted by the NBA Minneapolis Lakers but he turned them down so he could still represent his nation internationally. He ended up playing in the US in college at Southern Methodist University (SMU). Furlong expected to play at the 1956 Melbourne Olympics but in 1955 the Juan Perón government was overthrown by a military junta. The players had dedicated their 1950 World Championship to Perón and had been given cars after that title. The new government objected to dedicating anything to Perón and reported the cars to FIBA, which banned them from further international play as professionals. Furlong ran his company’s trucking firm, which also ran into trouble after the revolution. He acted in one movie En cuerpo y alma and was still a celebrity, but he turned to a new sport, tennis, and became quite good, especially in doubles. He was a seven-time national doubles champion and was ranked as high as #7 in the nation in singles. Furlong became a member of the Argentine Tennis Association in 1966 and later became vice-president. He also coached the Argentine Davis Cup team in the 1970s, leading them to the semi-finals of the Davis Cup in 1977.

64724,John Landy,Male,12 April 1930,182.0,69, Australia,AUS,"John Landy was an Australian middle-distance runner who, on 21 June 1954, at a meet in Turku, Finland, became the second man, after Roger Bannister, to run a mile in under four minutes. Landy competed at the 1952 and 1956 Olympic Games, winning a bronze medal in the 1,500 metres in 1956. He also spoke the Athlete’s Oath at the Opening Ceremony of the Melbourne Olympics. Landy joined the Geelong Guild Athletic Club in 1949, where he worked with legendary coach Percy Cerutty. Landy graduated from Dookie College at the University of Melbourne in 1954, where he also played Aussie Rules. At the 1952 Helsinki Olympics he ran both the 1,500 and 5,000 but failed to make the final in either event. Landy and Bannister then attacked the four-minute mile barrier over the next few years, with Bannister getting there first in May 1954. Landy broke Bannister’s world record with his 3:57.9 run in Turku, a mark that would stand for three years. The two were to meet in August 1954 at the British Empire and Commonwealth Games in Vancouver, British Columbia, in what was billed as “The Miracle Mile,” “The Race of the Century,” and “The Dream Mile.” In the final straight Landy appeared to have the race in hand but, coming down the stretch, he looked over his left shoulder to see where Bannister was, only to have the Brit pass him on the right and win the race in 3:58.8 as Landy recorded 3:59.6, the first time two men had run under four minutes in a mile race. At the 1956 Australia Championships, prior to the Melbourne Olympics, Landy famously stopped and checked on Ron Clarke, who had just fallen. Landy helped him to his feet and then took off after the field and still won the race, making up a large deficit. Scott Mitchell created a sculpture of the moment when Landy helped Clarke to his feet and it was dedicated in June 2002 at the Olympic Park in Melbourne. After his athletics career Landy entered the business world serving as senior manager at ICI Australia. He was later commissioner-general for the Australian Pavilion at Expo 86 in Vancouver and was on the Victorian Land Conservation Council from 1971-78, and eventually entered politics. Landy was sworn in as the 26th Governor of Victoria on 1 January 2001 and served until 7 April 2006. Landy’s honors and awards are numerous. He was made a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in 1955 for services to sport, and was awarded the Australian Sports Medal in 2000. In 2006 he was appointed a Commander of the Royal Victorian Order (CVO). Landy was inducted into the Sport Australia Hall of Fame in 1985. He received several honorary degrees, including a Doctor of Laws from the University of Victoria in 1994, a Doctor of Rural Science from the University of New England in 1997, and Doctor of Laws from the University of Melbourne in 2003 and from Deakin University in 2009.

In 1995 they were runners up at that tournament (and Pelletier placed 4th in the singles event) and placed 15th at the World Championships, but then placed 5th and 6th at the next two Canadian Championships and split up. Next, Pelletier paired up with Caroline Roy for the 1998 Canadian Championships, but the duo placed 6th and then split. Shortly before the tournament his former partner Laporte was killed in a car accident. Finally, he joined with his future wife Jamie Salé, whom he had tried out with once previously in 1996, and together they placed 2nd at the 1999 Canadian Championships, but pulled out of the World Championships due to Pelletier’s back pain. Salé and Pelletier returned in full swing in 2000, winning the Canadian Championships with a record five perfect scores from the judges, and coming in 4th at the World Championships. The following year they took a second Canadian Championship victory and a World Championship and jointly earned the Lou Marsh Trophy, given annually to Canada’s top athlete. In preparation for the 2002 Winter Olympics, the duo won another Canadian Championship that year, but they knew that they would have serious competition against the Russian pair of Yelena Berezhnaya and Anton Sikharulidze. Although the Canadians put on a flawless routine, the judges voted 5-4 in favor of the Berezhnaya and Sikharulidze, leaving Salé and Pelletier with silver. Several days later it was revealed that a French judge that had voted for the Russians had been pressured into her decision in exchange for Russian judges favoring the French ice dance team.

He was the first three-time consecutive winner of Canada’s Norton H. Crow Award for excellence in amateur athletics, earning it in 1961, 1962, and 1963. He did not receive his Canadian citizenship until 1962, however, and thus his international début had to wait until the 1963 Pan American Games. His performance did not disappoint at this tournament, as he captured a total of eight medals: gold in the all-around, floor exercise, and horse vault; silver in the parallel bars, pommeled horse, and horizontal bar, and bronze in the rings. He was less successful at the 1964 Tokyo Olympics, with his best finish being joint-fourteenth with Takashi Ono in the horse vault. His signature move, the “Weiler Kip”, is still used as a dismount from the horizontal bar. By career, Weiler joined the Canadian Armed Forces in 1958 and worked as a physical trainer in the military. He retired after the Tokyo Games, but returned in Mexico City in 1968 as a coach with the national team, and in 1972 and 1976 as a gymnastics judge. He retired from the military in 1991.

85602,Gerard Fairlie,Male,1 November 1899,,, Great Britain,GBR,"Gerard Fairlie had an interesting and varied life as a soldier, sportsman, journalist, fiction writer and broadcaster. As a child, he studied music in Belgium and was a cello prodigy. He then attended Downside school in Somerset before going to the Sandhurst Military College, from where he joined the Scots Guards. Fairlie spent six years in the Guards and during his time with them was a fine boxer and rugby player and, in 1924, was invited to join the British bobsleigh team at the first Winter Olympics. He was chosen purely because of his weight and build. He had never seen a bob, let alone ridden in one at that point of time, and only agreed to join the team because of the promise of a free holiday! During the Chamonix Games, Fairlie penned results and statistics which were used by The Times and, as a result, he became a journalist for them, and also worked for the Bystander and News of the World. He was The Times’ special correspondent at both the 1928 Summer and Winter Olympics. A good friend of Fairlie’s was Herman Cyril “Mac” McNeile, an author who used the pseudonym “Sapper”, and created the character Bulldog Drummond. “Sapper” announced live on a BBC radio programme that he based the Bulldog Drummond stories on Fairlie. As flattered as he was, Fairlie, who appeared on the same radio programme, was not convinced this was true. “Sapper” died at a young age in 1937, and Archie kept the Drummond character alive by writing seven more books in the series, having earlier been inspired by “Sapper” to write his first novel Scissors Cut Paper in 1927. During World War II, Fairlie worked as a correspondent for the War Office in France. He also worked on intelligence, but was captured by the Germans. However, he managed to escape, and get back to England before returning to intelligence work in France, for which he was twice awarded the Croix de Guerre. After the war, Fairlie went to Hollywood and wrote plays and films, including some based on the Bulldog Drummond character, and some featuring his own private eye creation, Johnny Macall. In total Fairlie wrote more than 40 books, and spent part of his later life living in Malta.",

36059,Tricia Smith,Female,14 April 1957,178.0,75, Canada,CAN,"After a short swimming career at the national level, Tricia Smith became involved in rowing at the age of 16 and quickly became a star on the Canadian scene, winning five national championships between 1974 and 1982. She made her international debut at the 1976 Summer Olympics, where she placed fifth in the coxless pairs with Betty Craig, and then spent the next three years as a member of a coxed eights crew, finishing third, third, and fifth at the World Championships from 1977 through 1979. She returned to the coxless pairs, and Craig, in 1980 and was selected for that year’s Summer Olympics, but stayed home after Canada joined the boycott of those Games. Undeterred, the duo earned silver, bronze, and bronze at the next three editions of the World Championships and then took their talents to the 1984 Summer Olympics, where they won silver behind Rodica Arba-Puşcatu and Elena Oprea-Horvat of Romania. Craig left active competition after the Games and Smith joined a coxed fours crew that took bronze medals at the 1985 and 1986 World Championships. She also won the event at the 1986 Commonwealth Games, alongside Christine Clarke, Lesley Thompson-Willie, Jane Tregunno, and Jennifer Walinga. In 1987 Craig came out of retirement and the duo won the Canadian Championships once more. After an eighth-place finish at that year’s World Championships, however, Craig bowed out again and Smith returned to the coxed fours, in which she placed seventh at the 1988 Summer Olympics (with Thompson-Willie, Tregunno, Walinga, and Heather Clarke). Smith retired after the Games and, having earned a law degree from the University of British Columbia in 1985, became a practicing attorney. Her affiliation with the sports world, however, did not end. After many years with UBC’s Athletic Committee and the International Federation of Rowing Associations, she was selected for the Canadian Olympic Committee’s (COC) executive board in 2005, having been involved with them since 1980. In 2007 she served as the Chef de Mission for Canada’s delegation to the Pan American Games and became a vice-president of the COC in 2009. She has also erved on the board of the International Council of Arbitration for Sport and, in 2016, became the head of the Canadian Olympic Committee. With her predecessor, Marcel Aubut, having resigned following complaints of sexual harassment, Smith declared her intent to reform the Committee’s institutional culture. Being named as a Member of the Order of Canada (2010) and the Order of British Columbia (2012), an honorary Doctor of Laws degree from UBC (2001), and induction into the British Columbia Sports (1992), the University of British Columbia Sports (1994), and Canadian Olympic (2000) Halls of Fame are among her many honors. She also remains a partner at Barnes Craig & Associates in Vancouver.

In the 1990s she was the most well-known Italian woman volleyball player, thanks to her activities in publicizing the sport and as a model. A very talented setter, Cacciatori was a precocious marvel: at only 15years-old she débuted in the Second League with Carrarese, the team of her native city. At the age of 16 she moved to Sirio Perugia, the team with whom she remained until 1993 and won the 1992 Italian Cup. A year later she joined Amazzoni Agrigento for two seasons without victories. In 1995 she signed up with Volley Bergamo, a team for whom she became captain and a symbol until 2003, with a break in the 1998-99 season with Napoli, when she won the CEV Cup. With Bergamo she dominated the second half of the 1990s with four Italian titles (1996-98, 2002), three Italian Cups (1996-98), three SuperCups (1996-97, 1999) and two European Cups (1997, 2000). In the 2003-04 season Cacciatori moved to Spain and joined Club Voleibal Tenerife, with whom she won a national title in 2004 and, in the same year, the European Cup, defeating the Italian club of Perugia in the final. She then returned to Italy, where she played a season with Start Alzano, and then finished her active career in Spain with Icaro Alarò. Cacciatori earned 228 caps with the national team, making her début on 27 December 1991 in a losing friendly against Russia at Apeldoorn (The Netherlands). She had few victories with the Azzurra shirt: gold at the 2001 Mediterranean Games (Italy-Turkey 3-0 in the final), second place at the 2001 Europeans and bronze at the 1999 Europeans. At the 1998 FIVB World Championships held in Japan (where Italy was coached by Angiolino Frigoni and finished fifth), Cacciatori was named best setter of the tournament. Cacciatori contributed to the growth of her sport in a decisive way such that, in Berlin 2002, they won the first World Title in the history of the women’s Italian volleyball. Cacciatori, however, did not participate in this victory because of conflict with coach Marco Bonitta who, after removing her from the rank of captain in favor of Manuela Leggeri, chose the young Rachele Sangiuliano as reserve for Eleonora Lo Bianco. After finishing her active career, Cacciatori again moved to Spain, where she was team manager of the Mallorca’s club. In 2006 Cacciatori was a contestant in the reality show L’Isola dei famosi, the Italian version of Celebrity Survivor, and since 2007 has been a sport commentator for Sky Sport. In the 2010s, with her partner Francesco Orsini (a former basketball player), she had two children, Carlos Maria and Ines.

In 1946 he was designated design director in the company’s head office in Osaka. Eight years later he left Takenaka in order to establish his own architectural firm. Judging from his graduation design Ishikawa never had any interest in expressionism but was immediately oriented on the abstract physical shape. In his early years he designed churches, industry and office buildings, at first mostly in his hometown of Yokohama. His main works include the Finger Road Church (1926) and Asahi Shimbun Yokohama office (1931) in Yokohama, a modern brewery in Hyogo prefecture (1930), the Tokyo Takarazuka Theater (1933), and the Asahi Building in Osaka City (1931), which was described at the time of completion as “the most sensational building in Japan”. The design Ishikawa submitted to the Olympic Arts Competition was a tower commemorating the 20th high school baseball tournament at the Koshien Stadium, a baseball park located near Kobe in Nishinomiya, Hyōgo Prefecture. At this stadium, the Japanese high school championships have been held for over 100 years. The current tower, however, is already the third generation but it still follows the original basic design. The tower was completed in 1934 in the pine forest east of the stadium. With a height of 33 meters, the tower was made of reinforced concrete with 20 pillars surrounding the central circle. The total diameter is 35 m, with staircase type bleachers of 8 steps. Its appearance is reminiscent of a circular fighting field like the Colosseum of ancient Rome.

Barrez was also the founder of the philanthropic association République de Montmartre in 1920, which had the aims of mutual aid and conviviality and is still existing today. The Poster for the Maori Tournée in France was created for a rugby match on December 26, 1926, in which New Zealand beat France 12:3. The motif was apparently used for other advertising posters for rugby games. It is possible that not all of his designs were actually realized. A Poster for Rowing is only confirmed for an event in 1948. The Affiche, Joueur de Balle - probably a soccer player - was only included in the last version of the catalog for the art competitions. Bridge/Barrez later also designed a poster for the 1938 World Cup in France. The abbreviation “(p.)” behind the titles of his works in the catalog indicates that the posters were not submitted as graphics but as paintings.",

She first represented Canada on the international stage at the 1971 Pan American Games where, in the absence of the United States, she won a gold medal in the team dressage event alongside Christilot Hanson-Boylen and Zoltan Sztehlo while placing fourth individually. She then attended her first edition of the Olympic Games the following year, where she finished 26th in the individual dressage and 6th among 10 nations in the team event (with Hanson-Boylen and Lorraine Stubbs). She was selected for the 1976 edition, but did not compete, and was then slated to attend the Games in 1980 until Canada boycotted them. Although she was offered an opportunity for the Soviets to pay her way to Moscow, she turned them down and therefore had to wait until 1988 to get another chance to participate in the Olympics. By then she was Cindy Ishoy and was coming off a second-place individual finish at that year’s World Cup, having placed behind Christine Stückelberger of Switzerland. Riding her horse Dynasty, Ishoy won bronze in the team dressage, alongside Eva-Maria Pracht, Ashley Nicoll-Holzer, and Gina Smith, and finished in fourth in the individual event, sixteen points shy of Stückelberger and the closest any Canadian has come to an individual Olympic dressage medal. The following year, Dynasty died of colic and, although she had many more successes over the course of her career, Neale was never able to relive her Olympic glory. At the 1992 Summer Olympics she was 10th in the team event and 34th individually while, in 2004, she placed 9th with the Canadian team and joint-31st individually.

921233,Władysław Skoczylas,Male,4 April 1883,,, Poland,POL,"Władysław Skoczylas was a Polish graphic artist, painter, illustrator, and art critic, who was known for his woodcuts in the style of medieval art. He won the bronze medal at the 1928 Art Competitions of the Amsterdam Olympic Games in the category Drawings and Water Colors. From 1901 Skoczylas studied sculpture at the School of Applied Arts in Wien (Vienna), then sculpture and painting at the Krakow-Union Academy of Fine Arts, and he finally studied sculpture in Paris and graphics in Leipzig. For several years, he lived in Zakopane, where he taught drawing at the School for Forest Industry. Beginning in 1918 he settled in Warszawa, where he studied at the Faculty of Architecture of the Technical University, and with the leading engraving faculty at the School of Art and later the Academy of Fine Arts. Skoczylas was a brilliant draftsman who created the Polish school of woodcut. He did not paint much, but when he did, his focus was on landscapes, portraits and genre scenes. According to the Official Report, Skoczylas received the bronze medal for Posters. This may be interpreted that he received the medal not for a single work but for the series of his four submitted watercolors, even if the term Posters seems to be a bit odd. Initially, Olympic historian Ferenc Mező attributed the bronze medal only to the Archer, which was adopted by many later authors. In the Official Report, Skoczylas’ Diana is also displayed. The second (kneeling) Archer and The Stag of St. Hubert could not be identified. Four other submitted works are woodcuts, which can be assigned to the Graphic Arts category. They were produced between 1920 and 1923 and are 20-26 cm wide and 16-22 cm high. Black-and-white and colored as well as colorized prints are known.",

He wrote, amongst others, Operas, the ballet Tycho Brahes Dröm and three symphonies. Børresen became an important organizer of several Danish music festivals and served as the president of the Danish Composers Union between 1924 and 1949. He was widely regarded as one of Denmark’s most important musicians, but did not become known outside his own country. The work submitted in 1932 may have been his Olympisk Hymn (or a draft for it) as it was not published and first performed before 1940.

Dušek was a sculptor, stonemason, and medalist. His son Jan (1936-1993) also became a sculptor. Jean created numerous busts and monuments of important personalities as well as allegorical figures. In 1921 he won first prize for the medal of the Young Workers’ Olympics. He was a close friend of the famous Czech photographer Josef Jindřich Šechtl (1877–1954). In 1924, Dušek entered the Archer and the Winner at the Finish. The latter actually bore the name Sokol Athlete and was created in 1924. The sculpture, which is over 1 m high, was produced on the occasion of a Sokol Sport Meeting in the city of Tábor, where he built his studio in 1922. Photos of the art exhibition in Berlin confirm that the sculpture titled Venture in the catalog is actually his Hercules sculpture, one of his most famous works. In contrast to the date 1936 mentioned in the catalog, the 112 x 48 x 17 cm sized bronze statue was probably made about 10 years earlier.

The team broke the Olympic record twice on the way to the final and then survived a precarious first few laps to beat Germany to the Olympic title. Vigna joined the professional ranks for the 1961 season with the Italian Philco team but made little impact until he joined the famous Legnano team in 1963. He won a stage of the Giro d’Italia in his only year with the team. Moving to the Pasta Gazzola Mondovì he won the biggest victory of his career at the Tre Valli Varesine as well as a stage of the Tour of Romandie in 1964 before riding the first of his three Giro d’Italias the following year. Vigna won Milano-Torino in 1966 but retired at the end of 1967 and began a career in team management with the Faema team.

He played as goaltender for Club Des Patineurs in 1913 and made his debut for France the same year. George played for France when they finished runners-up in the 1923 European Championships although the victorious Swedish team unsuccessfully protested against him for using oversized pads. He was deemed ineligible to compete at the 1924 Winter Games in Chamonix for not being a French national but, presumably, he then became a French citizen in the years before the 1928 Games. He was also an accomplished field hockey player and was a journalist for the French sports newspaper L’Auto in the 1930s. George’s most famous creation, although few know that he was responsible, is one of the most famous logos in sport. During a Davis Cup tennis match he made a wager with his friend René Lacoste over the outcome of a match. The prize was meant to be a crocodile skin bag belonging to George. Although Lacoste won the wager he did not receive his prize and instead George, said to be a talented designer, embroidered a crocodile on Lacoste’s tennis shirt.

He spent his first season as a junior (1983-1984) with the St. James Canadians of the Manitoba Junior Hockey League, and then the next four with the Western Hockey League’s Moose Jaw Warriors. In 1988 he shared the Bob Clarke Trophy as top scorer in the WHL with Joe Sakic and suited up for two matches with the International Hockey League’s Salt Lake Golden Eagles.

He fared better at the 1988 World Junior Championships and took home a gold medal as squad captain. After being drafted by the Calgary Flames of the National Hockey League in 1987, he split the 1988-1989 season between the Flames and the Golden Eagles before skating exclusively with the Flames until 1999, with the exception of a 10 game stint with Finland’s Tappara during the 1994-1995 NHL lockout. Along the way he helped capture the franchise’s first Stanley Cup in 1989, attended the 1990 and 1991 World Championships (winning a silver at the latter tournament), and was diagnosed with Crohn’s disease, which inflames the intestines, in 1995. He was also team captain from 1995 through 1997 and attended the 1998 Winter Olympics, scoring one goal in six games, but failing to reach the podium. By 1999 the Flames were unable to afford Fleury, so they traded him to the league’s Colorado Avalanche for the remainder of the 1998-1999 season. The following year he signed on with the NHL’s New York Rangers and stayed with them for three years, which were dogged by emotional and substance abuse problems. He joined the NHL’s Chicago Blackhawks for the 2002-2003 season, but his alcoholism overtook him and he left the league after a suspension in 2003. He did manage to play at the 2002 Winter Olympics, however, where he suited up for six matches and took home one of Canada’s first Olympic ice hockey gold medals in 50 years. He had seven games with the Horse Lake Thunder of the North Peace Hockey League in 2004-2005 and thirty-four with the Belfast Giants of the Elite Ice Hockey League in 2005-2006, where he was named the league’s Player of the Year. He reemerged during the 2008-2009 season for thirteen matches with the Steinbach North Stars of Hockey Manitoba, but a comeback with the Flames the following year proved infeasible, and he retired in September 2009. He had many endeavors off the ice during his career, including a minority stake in the Calgary Hitmen of the Western Hockey League, a concrete business, a pilot for a reality show, and two games with the Calgary Vipers of the Golden Baseball League. His autobiography “Playing With Fire”, released a month after his retirement, alleged sexual abuse at the hands of coach Graham James in the early 1980s.","Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the World Ice Hockey Championships (0–1–0 1991 Turku, Helsinki and Tampere silver)"

He was adopted by the Nakamura family and spent his youth in Osaka. A skater since the eighth grade, Oimatsu finished fifth in the men’s singles event at the 1930 Japan Figure Skating Championships, the tournament’s second year. He used the book about skating by Nikolay Panin to improve his skills. At the 1931 edition, however, Oimatsu finished first and was crowned the Japanese national champion, paving the way for his debut on the international scene in 1932, when he finished seventh at the World Figure Skating Championships, and ninth at the Olympic Winter Games. Oimatsu slid to second place at the 1933 Japan Championships and third in 1935. His final competitive year was 1936, where he finished ninth in the European Championships, 15th in the World Championships, and 20th at the Winter Olympics. Oimatsu’s amateur career was ended by World War II and a bout of tuberculosis in 1948. In the 1950s, however, he turned professional and worked as a lecturer and a coach with the Osaka Sports Center Skating Federation.

96476,Hugh Plaxton,Male,16 May 1904,178.0,84, Canada,CAN,"Left winger Hugh Plaxton had an incredibly varied series of careers over his life, of which amateur and professional hockey was a significant part. While studying for his law degree at the University of Toronto, he was a member of the Theta Delta Chi fraternity and the university’s hockey team, on which he played from 1921 through 1925. After graduating, he suited up with the Toronto Graduates for two seasons, winning the Allan Cup in 1927 as a member of the Canadian men’s senior amateur championship team. It was this victory that sent him to the 1928 Winter Olympics, where he played in three games, scored twelve goals, and took home a gold medal. He also stirred up controversy when he threatened to boycott the games unless his cousin Roger and brother Bert Plaxton were added to the team. This threat was successful, even though it went against coach Conn Smythe’s original wishes. He took a break from hockey after the Olympics, practicing law in Ontario from 1928 until 1932. In this year, he joined the Windsor Bulldogs of the International Hockey League, the Vancouver Maroons of the Western Canadian Hockey League and the Montreal Maroons of the National Hockey League, playing 15 games for the latter. Plaxton retired from hockey and returned to his law practice, but his interests soon turned to politics and he successfully ran for MP of the Toronto riding of Trinity as a liberal in 1935, defeating former Toronto mayor George Geary. His platform included promises on health insurance, minimum wage increases and youth improvement. During his time in Parliament, he introduced a resolution that would call for the creation of a Ministry of Sports, but was eventually forced to withdraw it for political reasons. After losing the Liberal Party’s nomination in 1940, he served in World War II in the Canadian Navy as Lieutenant Commander of the HMCS York. After the war, he regained the Liberal Party’s nomination, but failed to capture the riding of Kingston City. It was his last foray into politics, and afterwards he resumed his law career.",Brother of Bert Plaxton Cousin of Rod Plaxton Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the World Ice Hockey Championships (1–0–0 1928 St. Moritz (Olympics) gold) Listed in Olympians Who Were Members of National Legislatures (Member of Canadian House of Commons 14 October 1935 through 1940 (Liberal))

After a trip to Spain in 1898, her initially realistic-idyllic style changed into a poetic-imaginative style, often with allegorical and mythological motifs. In addition to paintings, she designed postcards, posters, and illustrations. In 1903 Dufau was a founding member of the Salon d’Automne and in 1909 became a Knight of the Legion of Honor. Through her deep love for Maurice, the gay son of the playwright Edmond Rostand, she developed an androgynous personality herself. In her later years she was impoverished and withdrew into the Bay of Antibes and finally into a small studio in Paris. Dufau had already taken up sporting themes at the beginning of the century and depicted scenes, for instance, from pelota games. Outside of the art competitions, her painting Nageurs au Cap d’Antibes was first shown at the Petit Palais in Paris.",

Only in 2002 did she confirm her correct year of birth. Silivaș started to compete in National Junior Championships in 1981 and participated in the 1984 European Junior Championships, where she won gold in balance beam and silver in uneven bars and floor – the three apparatuses on which she would become world class. Her first competition on the senior level followed in 1985 – though under-aged – when she competed in Montréal at the World Championships. Silivaș obtained a perfect 10 and won the title on the balance beam as well as a silver medal with the team. In 1987 she won three gold medals (uneven bars, floor, and team) at the World Championships and four gold medals (all-around, uneven bars, floor, and balance beam - no team event was held) at the European Championships, before becoming the gymnastic superstar of the 1988 Olympics. Silivaș medaled in every event including three golds on uneven bars, floor, and balance beam, making her the most successful female gymnast in Seoul. In 1989 she suffered a serious knee injury, but was again able to win three golds (uneven bars, floor, and balance beam) at the World Championships and gold in floor at the European Championships. In total she won 7-2-1 medals at the World Championships and 5-3-2 at the European Championships. The Romanian Revolution of 1989 (which resulted in a loss of training opportunities), a surgery on her knee in 1990, and emigration to the United States in 1991 ended her career.

1005435,Bruce Wells,Male,7 July 1933,,, Great Britain,GBR,"At age of 14 in 1948, Bruce Wells started boxing on doctor’s advice to build up his strength following a serious illness. He was nearly 6 feet (1.93m) tall at the time, but weighed just eight stones (50.8kg) After winning ABA Youths and Junior titles, Wells stepped up to the seniors in 1952 and reached the ABA light-middleweight final, only to lose to Bernard Foster in the final. Wells went on to win the title, however, in 1953 and 1954. Wells competed in the 1953 European Amateur Championships at Warszawa (Warsaw). He beat local favourite Zbigniew Pietrzykowski in the light-middleweight semi-final before going on to beat West Germany’s Max Resch with a unanimous decision. Wells was only a reserve in the light-middleweight class at 1952 Olympics. That year, for the first time, the selectors decided that all Olympic categories should be contested by the respective reigning ABA champions, which ruled out Wells after his defeat by Foster. In 1954, Wells went to the USA as captain of the European team and won both his contests against the Chicago and St. Louis Golden Gloves champions, Art Glass and Leslie Temple respectively. At that year’s British Empire and Commonwealth Games in Vancouver, Wells won a bronze medal, despite beating New Zealander Maurice Tuck in the semi-final. Halfway through the first round of their semi-final bout, both men were sent sprawling to the canvas after a clash of heads. They both got to their feet but Wells had blood pouring from his left eye and the contest was stopped. A doctor was called into the ring and ruled that neither man was fit to continue and under the rules, the fight was awarded to Wells as he was ahead on points. As he was not fit to contest the final, the other two semi-finalists stepped up to fight for the gold medal. Wells served as a sergeant in the Royal Air Force (RAF) and won both inter-services and RAF titles. He retired from boxing in 1956 after more than 300 wins but remained in the RAF. During his last two years of service, Wells helped with the boxing training of servicemen. Wells became a professional boxing trainer in 1958 and later worked as a PE teacher at a Hammersmith school. In the 1960s he found a career as an actor in television and the movies. Amongst others, Wells appeared in nine episodes of the cult TV programme Doctor Who, and the 1965 movie Doctor Who and the Daleks. Another of Wells’ claims to fame was that he “knocked out” Muhammad Ali in a charity exhibition bout at South Shields in 1977.",Listed in Olympians Who Acted in Movies (Doctor Who and The Daleks)

However, his strongest suit remained speed skating.

Held at the high-altitude rink of Davos, Farstad broke all his personal bests to set what would later be the first recognized as an Allround World Record. Continuing to race until 1951, he never again qualified for an international championship. Until his death in 1978, Farstad worked as a journalist for Arbeiderbladet.

In the summer of 1956, Blair bettered the world record for the hammer when he threw 65.95 (216-4½) at a meet near Boston. There were problems with the measurement of the mark, however, and it was never submitted for ratification.

The planned sports center Varkauden Urheilukeskus was never realized due to disagreement between the main sponsor and the community. It was to consist of 45 different elements (sports field, sports hall, swimming pool, tennis and ball courts, and a rowing regatta, but also a lookout tower and locations for outdoor theater and parties). At the intended site on the island of Kanavasaari only one sports field was created and opened in 1951. Later, a grandstand and an ice rink were added. Lindegren studied at the Technical University of Helsinki and founded his own architecture studio. He planned mainly sports facilities but also industrial buildings and residential complexes. His “snake house” Käärmetalo in Helsinki from 1951 became particularly well-known. Lindegren designed the Olympic Stadium of Helsinki for the Olympic Games in 1940 together with Toivo Jäntti. Although the Games were not held due to World War II, the stadium was built in 1938, and was eventually used for the 1952 Olympics. In 1937 Lindegren won the Grand Prix for architecture at the World’s Fair in Paris. In the mid-1940s, he worked together with Alvar Aalto and Viljo Revell, making several community plans for post-World War II Finland. Lindegren died of a heart attack shortly after the Helsinki Olympics. In 1952, Lindegren presented his design of of Tampere’s Ratina Stadium from the year 1950 at the Olympic art exhibition. He won a competition against Immu Niemeläinen. Lindegren’s project included a stadium and a sports hall with a view to the Helsinki Olympics. By 1952, however, the stadium had only been provisionally completed. Nevertheless, several games of the Olympic football (soccer) tournament were held here. The audience of up to 20,000 spectators had to watch the action from temporary earth walls. The 1928 decathlon gold medalist Paavo Yrjölä lit another Olympic flame in the stadium. After Lindegren’s sudden death, his colleague, Prof. Aulis Blomstedt (1906-79), was to finalize his plans. At least the stadium was finally completed in 1966 with a newly designed grandstand by Timo Penttilä (1931-2011).",

Although they had a European birthplace in common, their occupations could hardly have been more divergent – Hicks was a clown by profession and Coray earned his living as a professional strike-breaker. Tom Hicks had been around the American distance running scene for some years, having finished sixth in Boston in 1900, improving to fifth in 1901 and placing second in 1904. This experience was to stand him in good stead, considering the extreme conditions in which the 1904 Olympic marathon was run. The course was hilly, the temperature was 90° F, there were no watering stations apart from a well at the halfway mark, and the automobiles following the race churned up a great deal of dust. Only the fact that Hicks had been sustained by doses of brandy, egg white, and strychnine during the latter stages of the race enabled him to finish. But his dreams of being champion were shattered when he arrived at Francis Field only to see Fred Lorz being photographed, as the victor, with Alice Roosevelt, the daughter of the President Teddy Roosevelt. It later transpired that Lorz had covered much of the course in an automobile and then claimed that his Olympic “victory” was only a practical joke. The AAU did not share his sense of humor and they immediately banned him (he was later reinstated and won the 1905 Boston Marathon). No more was heard of Hicks as after his ordeal, both physical and mental, he retired on the spot. Personal Best: Mar – 2-39:04 (1904).",

The attendance was nearly as many as the entire population of Curaçao at time. At that year’s Central American and Caribbean Games at Barranquilla, Colombia, Hato and Curaçao won a bronze medal, and at Guatemala in 1950 he won a gold medal with the Netherlands Antilles selection representing the NAOC, having played in their first ever official international just two years earlier. Hato played in goal at the 1952 Olympics, but was also a useful outfielder when needed, and was a regular penalty taker, but he missed a 25th minute spot kick against Turkey at the Olympics which, if he had converted it, would have leveled the scores at 1-1. His services as an outfield player were required at the 1953 CCCF (Confederación Centroamericana y del Caribe de Fútbol) Championship in Costa Rica, when he was used as a forward and scored two goals in the 8-0 win over Nicaragua, and another two in the 4-2 win over Panama. He was also a member of the 1955 Pan American Games bronze medal-winning team, when he was back in goal. It was the only time Netherland Antilles entered the competition. They won the bronze by virtue of finishing third in a four-team competition, Also in 1955, Hato won a silver medal with Curaçao at the CCCF Championship. He played for his country 36 times between 1946-57 and his last international appearance was in a 2-1 defeat by Costa Rica in a qualifying match for the 1958 World Cup. Despite many lucrative offers from top teams to play in Europe, he turned them all down to play in his hometown of Willemstad.

For her efforts she received the Lou Marsh Trophy –awarded annually to Canada’s top athlete – and the Velma Springstead Trophy, which honors Canadian women’s achievement in sport. After a child and several injuries that affected her performance at the 1998 Winter Games, she retired from biathlon.

In March 2010 the Quebec Court of Appeal upheld her conviction and sentence, although her lawyer vowed to bring the case before the Supreme Court.

A skilled power forward, Sandström was effective when healthy but his career was marred by injuries due to his physical style of play. Sandström started his hockey career in 1979 with Fagersta HK and from 1982-84 was with Brynäs IF. Sandström was drafted by the New York Rangers of the NHL in 1983, joining the club in 1984. Sandström played 5½ seasons with the Rangers, until he was traded to the Los Angeles Kings in mid-season 1990. But Sandström’s time with the Kings was marred by several serious injuries that included a 1990 fight that left him with a scratched cornea and broken cheekbone and he sustained a broken leg in the 1991 Smythe Division Finals. Sandström was a key component of the Kings’ run to the 1993 Stanley Cup Finals, after missing most of the regular season with a broken jaw. Sandström finished third in playoff scoring after legendary Wayne Gretzky and Doug Gilmour. In the 1993-94 mid-season, Sandström was traded to the Pittsburgh Penguins and in the 1996-97 season was traded to the Detroit Red Wings. Although Sandström stayed with the Red Wings only half a season, he won the 1997 Stanley Cup with them. After his short stay with the Red Wings, Sandström joined the Anaheim Mighty Ducks as a free agent and played with them for two seasons.

One year later they won bronze with Hans Schmidt instead of Braumüller. Ten years later this team claimed the first German Championship after World War II. Kemser had already won his first title 10 years earlier in the four-man event. In 1953, he added one more German title in the two-man event with Andreas Ostler as well as a silver medal at the World Championships the same year. Kemser also won the gold medal at the 1952 Winter Games at Oslo with Ostler and Lorenz Nieberl in the four-man event and completed by Fritz Kuhn. In order to have a shot at the title, the second German four-man sled wasn’t entered, and instead the two heaviest pushers – Kuhn and Kemser – joined Ostler and Nieberl in the remaining sled. This gave the Germans a decisive advantage, as they weighed in at 472 kg (including sled), and they comfortably slid to the gold. The international bobsleigh federation (FIBT) soon afterwards decided to limit the weight for four-man teams to 420 kg. Kemser made his living as a wholesaler.

88,Laurie Doherty,Male,8 October 1875,,, Great Britain,GBR,"The Doherty brothers, Laurie and Reggie, reigned supreme in the tennis world at the turn of the century and were one of the finest doubles pairings in the history of the game. Both educated at Westminster School and Trinity Hall, Cambridge, they won the Wimbledon doubles a record eight times, took he US title twice and were unbeaten in the five Davis Cup rubbers they played together. When they were at their peak, the Doherty’s lost only four of the countless doubles matches they played together. The younger of the two, Laurie, had slightly the better record as a singles player, winning Wimbledon five times to Reggie’s four and also winning the US singles in 1903, being the only overseas player to do so between 1881 and 1925. Laurie also enjoyed an impeccable record in the Davis Cup, winning all twelve of his rubbers. Reggie won the Wimbledon singles from 1897-1900 and Laurie took the title from 1902-1906, with Arthur “Wentworth” Gore being the only person able to prevent the brothers from completely monopolizing the Championship for a full decade when he beat Reggie in the 1901 Challenge Round. Their feats are commemorated by “The Doherty Gates” at the south-west entrance of the All-England Club. In the Olympic singles in 1900, Laurie Doherty was scheduled to meet Reggie in the semi-finals but Reggie conceded a walkover so that Laurie met the Irishman, Harold Mahony, in the final. Mahony reputedly had the best volley and the worst forehand in the game and at times this was clearly an adequate enough combination as Mahony had won the 1896 Wimbledon singles. But in Paris, Mahony’s assets and liabilities failed to meet the searching demands of Doherty’s audit and the Englishman won the gold medal in straight sets. Laurie won a second gold medal in the men’s doubles with Reggie as his partner. The 1900 Official Report indicates that the scratch pairing of Max Décugis (FRA) and Spalding de Garmendia (USA) gave the Doherty’s a good match before losing 6-3, 6-3, 7-5, but The Field reported that the British pair had a rather more comfortable victory at 6-1, 6-1, 6-0. Laurie also played in the Mixed Doubles at the 1900 Olympics with the American, Marion Jones, as his partner but they were beaten in the semi-finals by Reggie and Charlotte Cooper, winner of the Women’s singles. After poor healthy forced Laurie to retire from top class tennis in 1906 he turned to golf and with a handicap of plus two at Royal St. George’s he played several times in the Amateur Championship. His best performance was on his home course in 1908 when he reached the last sixteen. In 1914, Laurie Doherty joined the Royal Naval Reserve but the rigors of service in an anti-aircraft unit hastened the breakdown of his delicate constitution and he died, aged 43, after a long illness.",Brother of Reggie Doherty Listed in Olympic Champions Who Have Played in a Davis Cup Final Winning Team (Olympic Gold - 1900; Davis Cup - 1903 / 1904 / 1905 / 1906)

He was discovered as a boxer in the Abasto neighbourhood, where a couple of well-known boxers had their roots. In 1928, Robledo was just 15-years-old and the youngest member of the Argentine delegation. This made him an Olympic veteran when he took part in Los Angeles, although he just turned 20 a few weeks before the Games. Along with other contemporary Argentine sports figures in 1950 Robledo was cast in the comedy film “Campeón a la fuerza” (Champion of Power). He worked as a clerk from Buenos Aires, but little is known about his later life. Some sources indicate that he died around 1981, while others give a date in the early 1960s. There is an anecdote about Robledo that, at the moment when Juan Carlos Zabala crossed the finish line to win the marathon, Robledo, in his exuberance, threw a pennant with an iron shaft at Zabala, which hit him on the head, and knocked him to the floor, although this was initially attributed to Zabala’s weariness.",

Both of his parents Alice Randall Marsh (1869-1929) and Frederick Dana Marsh (1872-1961) were American painters who lived in Paris. The family was wealthy and moved back to New Jersey when he was 2-years-old. Marsh studied at Yale University and then moved to New York, where he was a student of, for instance, Benjamin Luks, and began to work as an illustrator. Numerous well-known magazines such as Vanity Fair, New Yorker and Harper’s Bazaar published his works. In the mid-1920s Marsh traveled extensively through Europe. Marsh later devoted himself to etchings, and oil and watercolor painting. His main motivation were the burlesque, the poor and socially deprived of New York. One of his most famous students in his Department at the Art Students League in New York was the renowned pop-artist Roy Lichtenstein (1923-1997). Marsh also lectured in Oakland and Philadelphia. His etching Wrestlers, exhibited “hors concours” in 1932, had a format of 17.8 x 12.8 cm and was created in 1931. It is much more difficult to identify the work for the 1936 Art Competitions titled The Bathers. Marsh produced numerous drawings, prints and watercolors depicting bathers but almost all of them are dated from the 1940s and 1950s. Various etchings entitled Coney Island Beach from 1934 and 1935, however, became well-known showing groups of bathers.",

Sakata is best remembered, however, for his role as the evil villain “Oddjob” in the James Bond movie, Goldfinger. During the filming of the movie, Sakata was once asked to put some realism into a karate chop and ended up putting star Sean Connery out of action for several days. Sakata himself suffered painful burns, but no permanent injuries, from the final electrocution scene at the end of the movie. Goldfinger was his first movie but he continued acting until his death in 1982.","Listed in Olympians Involved in James Bond movies (Played henchman Oddjob in ""Goldfinger"") Listed in Olympians Who Acted in Movies (Notably as henchman Oddjob in the Bond movie Goldfinger (1964).)"

When all the rumors proved to be true, which Armstrong admitted in early 2013, the entire house of lies collapsed and he lost multiple sources of endorsement income that Stapleton had arranged for him. During this entire sordid affair, which went on for most of decade, Stapleton never admitted any knowledge of these transgressions.

He immediately enlisted in the British Army and served with these forces throughout the war. After the war ended he returned to Canada and completed his studies at the Royal Military College before once again travelling across the Atlantic to England. A star in multiple sports during his college days, Holmes was captain of the British Army’s ice hockey team and as such was a natural choice for Great Britain’s first Olympic team. He played some part in 4 of the 5 games the British team played and scored his only Olympic goal in the 19-3 rout of Belgium. Soon afterwards Holmes, who had become a devout Christian during the war, left his army career and ice hockey behind to become a missionary in East Africa.

Educated at a naval college, he was a midshipman in the Navy but deserted to fight in the trenches of World War I with the South African Scots Regiment. He was pardoned after winning the Military Cross at the Battle of Arles and later fought with the Cossacks against the Red Army on the Russian Steppes. Recruited for the British modern pentathlon team for the Antwerp Games he finished in the middle ranks in all five disciplines and completed the event in fourteenth position. He was also boxing champion of the British Army. His career as a diplomat, soldier and colonial officer saw him posted around East Africa and the Arabian peninsular and he fought in campaigns in both Sudan and Ethiopia. Commander of the Sudan Camel Corps in the thirties, Boustead then led some of the forces that helped restore the Emperor Haile Selassie to the throne of Ethiopia. After World War II Boustead served for many years as a diplomat in Yemen. One of his school teachers was the legendary mountaineer George Mallory and Boustead himself was an explorer and climber. He took part in an expedition to Kangchenjunga, the world’s third largest mountain, in 1926 and for the mapping ability shown during this trip, he was invited to take part in the unsuccessful 1933 British expedition to climb Mount Everest. He also took part in expeditions to map the Libyan Desert and the icy wastes of Greenland. He was knighted by Queen Elizabeth in 1965 and published his autobiography The Wind of Morning in 1971.",

58193,Bill Hayes,Male,20 April 1891,,, Great Britain,GBR,"As an 18-year-old tea packer, William Hayes won the Shop Assistants’ Athletic Association featherweight wrestling title at Forest Gate, London, in 1909. This would appear to be the only title of significance that he won, other than those at his local club, St. Matthew’s AC. Having stepped up to lightweight, Hayes competed in the 1911 German Gymnastic Society Annual Championships but was beaten in the second round by the eventual winner E. G. Saxby of the London AWC. The following year. Hayes went to Stockholm as part of the Great Britain Greco-Roman wrestling squad but, like the other members of the team, came home without a medal. Following the Olympics, Hayes emigrated to Australia, where his mother and brother were already living. He settled in Boonoonar, Victoria with his wife where he became a wheat farmer. He continued to be involved in wrestling, competing in the Victoria Amateur Championships for the Mildura Harriers, and the Adelaide 1935 Australian National Games in the light heavyweight class. Hayes also ran for political office in the 1930s. Following his retirement from farming in 1937, he sold his land and moved to Sherpparton, Victoria. Eventually settling in Palm Beach, Queensland, he died there in 1972.",

In 1911, swimming in the open sea but without any tidal advantage, he bettered the world 100y record by almost five seconds. Not surprisingly, this and some of his other marks, were viewed with skepticism by the AAU. However, after Duke had competed on the mainland and then in Europe, the world was left with no doubt that a genuine new swimming talent had arrived. He went on to set numerous world records and only Johnny Weissmuller prevented him from winning an unprecedented hat trick of Olympic 100 free titles. Kahanamoku won his second Olympic title in 1920 on his 30th birthday but his Olympic career was far from over. He won a silver medal in 1924, was an alternate on the 1928 team and in 1932, after 10 years in Hollywood, was an alternate to the water polo team. Later he went to Hollywood to be an actor. One of his films triggered the boom of surfing. His bronze monument can be seen at the Waikiki beach in Honolulu. He was the first athlete to be inducted into the International Halls of Fame for swimming and surfing. 1932-1961 he Kahanamoku was Sheriff of Honolulu from 1932-61.
