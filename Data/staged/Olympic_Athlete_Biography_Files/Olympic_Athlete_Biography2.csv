Prior to his induction he and Dafoe had spent four years (1952-1955) as Canadian pairs champions, three (1953-1955) as North American champions and two (1954-1955) as world champions in figure skating pairs. They were also runner up at the World Championships in 1953 and 1956 and 4th in 1952. The duo had competed at the 1952 Winter Olympics, finishing fifth, but at the 1956 Games they were defeated narrowly (and controversially) by only the Austrians. Among the moves that Dafoe and Bowden pioneered were the twist lift, the overhead lasso lift, the throw jump, and the “leap of faith”. Unlike Dafoe, however, he also achieved success in the singles category and was the Canadian junior champion, and later earned the title of senior champion in 1947. Although he was suspended after his 1956 retirement and had his career delayed several years, he eventually began working as a judge, climbing his way up to judging figure skating competitions at the world level.

921785,Gari Melchers,Male,11 August 1860,,, United States,USA,"Gari Melchers was a prominent American painter and muralist of German descent in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. His painting style was characterized by impressionism, colorism and naturalism. He gained popularity first in the Netherlands and Germany with landscapes and depictions of country life. Melchers later turned to garden paintings and portraits. He established studios in the Netherlands, Virginia, and New York City over the course of his career. Melchers studied in Düsseldorf at the Academy of Arts and at the Académie Julian and the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris. In 1903 he was married to Corinne Mackall (1880-1953), a Baltimore painter. In 1906 Melchers became fine arts advisor to the Telfair Academy of Arts and Sciences in Savannah, for which he acquired more than 70 works of art. In 1909 he was appointed Professor of Art at the Grand Ducal Saxony School of Art in Weimar, Germany, but in 1915 he returned to New York. His father Julius Theodore Melchers (1829-1908) was a German-born American sculptor and art teacher. Gari Melchers was appointed Officer of the Legion of Honor and Officer of the Prussian Order of the Red Eagle. In 1932 he was awarded the Gold Medal of the American Academy of Arts and Letters. The Fencing Master, sometimes simply called The Fencer, was exhibited in 1932 hors concours. There are two versions of this motif plus preliminary studies in oil. They belonged to a small number of life-size representations of men in their professional roles. However, they were intended to be genre paintings rather than portraits. The composition of the painting was more important than the identity of the model, here the French painter Ernest Noir (1864-1931). At the Olympic exhibition, the version exhibited was probably with the fencer looking straight at the viewer. It is kept in the Detroit Institute of Art, from where it was already lent at that time. Melchers painted the 206.4 x 100.3 cm size oil painting already about 1895.",

Pérez won 18 amateur tournaments from 1944-50, including Latin American titles in 1946, 1947, and 1950. He attempted to compete at the 1952 Helsinki Olympics but was not chosen for the Argentinian Olympic team so he turned professional. Débuting in December 1952 with a TKO victory over José Ciorino, Pérez would win his first 23 professional fights before drawing against Yoshio Shirai in July 1954. In November of that year, he again faced Shirai and defeated him by unanimous decision to claim the world flyweight title. Pérez would go on to defend that title nine times, although during that span he had another 18 non-title fights, winning them all. He was finally defeated for the first time by Sadao Yaoita in a non-title bout on 16 January 1959, but then avenged that defeat, winning by a 13th round TKO against Yaoita in November 1959. Pérez finally relinguished his world flyweight crown on 16 April 1960 when he lost a split decision to Pone Kingpetch in Bangkok, Thailand, Kingpetch’s home country. In September 1960 Pérez and Kingpetch fought again in Los Angeles, with Kingpetch again winning, that time by an 8th round TKO. Oddly, Pérez never again fought for a title, but after his two losses to Kingpetch he won his next 30 fights before losing a split decision to Leo Zulueta in April 1963. His career spiraled downhill after that, as Pérez lost four of his final six bouts, ending his career after being defeated in March 1964 by Eugenio Hurtado. Pérez would retire with a professional record of 84 wins (57 by KO), 7 losses, and 1 draw. Pascual Pérez was inducted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame and the World Boxing Hall of Fame.

Still only 17 and too young to compete in the national amateur championships, Khan comfortably won the tournament and became the youngest British Olympic boxer for 30 years. He beat the champions of Europe and Asia to reach the final at the Athens Olympics but the experience of Cuba’s Mario Kindelan was too much for Khan and he was forced to settle for the silver medal. By now approaching superstar status in Britain he elected to join the ranks of professional boxing and made his pro début in July 2005. He won his first 18 fights before being the victim of a first-round knockout at the hands of Breidis Prescott in the summer 2008 but rebounded to win the WBA light-welterweight title 12 months later. Khan added the IBF version of the title in early 2011 but lost both versions of the title in an upset defeat to Lamont Peterson in December of the same year. His younger brother, Haroon, has represented his parents’ homeland of Pakistan as a boxer whilst his cousin, Sajid Mahmood, has been a member of the England cricket team.","Listed in Olympic Boxers Who Won a Professional World Championship (Olympics - 2004 Lightweight (Silver); Professional World Champion - WBA Light-Welterweight (2009-2011, 2012); IBF Light-Welterweight (2011))"

162,Fritz Traun,Male,29 March 1876,,, Germany,GER,"Fritz Traun was a multi-talented sportsman, but was primarily known as a track and field athlete when he competed at the 1896 Olympics. He was Germany’s best middle distance runner of the time, yet failed to qualify in the heats of the 100 and 800 metres in Athens. He then switched to tennis, which he had been playing for several years. He was a board member of the Heidelburg Tennis Club, but was not known as a player. He was beaten by Boland in the singles, but was then invited to join the Irishman in the doubles tournament. The two won that event with considerable ease. Traun switched his main focus to tennis after the Games, although he would better the German long jump record later that year. He won various tennis tournaments in Germany, his last and biggest success being the Austrian Tournament in Praha of 1902, where he won both the singles and doubles. In the winter of 1904, he competed with his bobsled “Hansa” at various St. Moritz competitions, achieving some good results. He was one of the founders of the German Golf Federation and served as their secretary, and was a co-founder and secretary general of the Hamburg Golf Club. Traun was also a keen automobile collector. In the winter of 1902-03, Traun developed tuberculosis and spent much of the next few years at spas and resorts in Europe, attempting to treat the disease. In 1908, he married Friedel Preetorius, and they left for a three-month honeymoon by car. After returning to Germany, they settled in a Hamburg hotel. On the morning of 11 July 1908, a woman entered Traun’s hotel, met with him, and announced that she and Traun were also married. After their meeting, he shot and killed himself in the bathroom of his apartment. Her identity and the validity of her claim was never revealed, but it seems probable that Traun killed himself rather than face the ensuing scandal. Traun, who worked for his father’s company, left his wife behind pregnant, and their daughter, Lieselotte, was born six months after his death.

He came from a family related to the then ruling Qajar dynasty (1789-1925). He started painting at school and, much to the displeasure of his family, attended the Kamāl-ol-Molk art school from 1917, graduating after three years. However, he had a desire for sculpturing, but there was no educational institution in Iran at the time. His teacher Ghaffārī (1848-1941) recognized his talent and set up a sculpture workshop at the art school. In 1925, Sadighi created his first stone statue. The reigning Ahmad Shah Qajar (1898–1930) then put him in charge of the new sculpture workshop at the College of Fine Arts. In 1927 he traveled to France via the Soviet Union to continue his studies in Paris. Along the way, Sadighi continued to produce numerous paintings. In 1934 he returned to Iran and reopened the School of Fine Arts after it had been closed. After founding a second art school, which later became part of Tehran University, he taught there and became head of the stone sculpture department. From 1950, he created portraits of famous Persians for the National Construction Authority. In 1961 he finally gave up his teaching position and worked as a freelance artist. This enabled him to get to know Italy and its art on another trip to Europe. During his stay there, the revolution in Iran took place, and as a result, iconoclasts damaged several of his statues. Planned projects had to be cancelled. Sadighi then spent his last years in seclusion in Iran and lived to the age of 101. He created 83 statues, including those of famous contemporaries such as the two Pahlavi shahs (Reza Shah Pahlavi, 1878-1944; Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, 1919-80) and historical figures. In 1952, Sadighi submitted a life-size plaster statue of the Persian poet Abū ʾl-Qāsim Firdausī (910-1020). It was later transposed into Carrara marble with a height of 185 cm and erected in 1958 as a gift from the city of Tehran to Rome in the surroundings of Villa Borghese. A copy was later made for Firdausī’s tomb in the Iranian city of Tus. Sadighi’s first portraits of Firdausī were created as early as in the 1930s, however, some of them are lost; he produced a last statue of the standing Firdausī for the square of the same name in Tehran in 1971.",Listed in Olympians Who Reached the Age of 100 (Participant in a non-medal event)

During the following years, he was a regular exhibitor at the state-controlled Emperor’s Exhibitions and was awarded prizes in 1922 and 1928 for Yōga style paintings of modern girls called bijinga. He continued to take part in the Emperor’s ,and later the New Bunten, Exhibitions during the 1930s and 1940s. One of his most famous paintings is Beauty Under Cherry Blossoms. Concurrently, Enomoto also attended private exhibitions of Kaburagi’s Kyodo-kai and Shinsui Ito’s Seikin-kai, known for their avant garde style. In 1946 he was appointed as a juror for the The Japan Fine Arts Exhibition, also known as Nitten. His works were far from traditional and an essential element of his art was the often awkward mixture of Japanese customs with Western modernity. He also became known for his unique use of colors (especially reds) and for applying metallic pigments to the surface of the painting. Later Enomoto also produced still lifes. He was also commissioned to paint murals, notably in 1936 commemorating the marriage of the Japanese Prince Chichibu and in 1962 for a hotel in Tokio. In the catalog, his painting Play in Garden comes with the addition “Golf”. This excludes respective motifs with other games and sports.",

The offer passed to the Kitchener-Waterloo Dutchmen, who accepted, and then recruited Douglas to join them on the journey. A defenseman, he played in seven matches and scored three goals against the German team, eventually earning him an Olympic silver medal. Douglas’ situation was soon reversed, however, as the Chatham Maroons won the Allan Cup in 1960, but rejected the chance to play for Canada at the 1961 World Championships. Their Allan Cup opponents, the Trail Smoke Eaters, agreed to play and eventually earned the gold medal. It was not, however, his last opportunity to represent Canada internationally. When the Galt Terriers won the Allan Cup in 1961, Douglas was again recruited to play abroad and he earned a second silver medal at the World Championships. During his final season, he suited up for one game with the Pittsburgh Hornets of the American Hockey League, in addition to his duties with the Chatham Maroons.

69553,Emil Voigt,Male,31 January 1883,165.0,53, Great Britain,GBR,"Born in Ardwick, Lancashire, England of German parentage, Emil Voigt retained for Great Britain the Olympic 5 miles title that Henry Hawtrey had won in 1906. Voigt was educated at Ross Place School, and later joined the Slade Harriers and the Manchester AC. By virtue of his win in the AAA 4 miles ten days earlier, Voigt was one of the favorites for the 1908 Olympic title, his main opposition came from John Svanberg of Sweden, the world record holder at 5,000 metres, and Charles Hefferon, the versatile holder of the South African mile record, who was to finish second in the marathon later in the Games. Voigt soon disposed of this foreign challenge and won the Olympic title with 70 yards to spare over fellow Mancunian Eddie Owen. Voigt later claimed that his victory was mainly due to his being a vegetarian, teetotaler, and non-smoker. Emil Voigt retained his AAA 4 mile title in 1909, and after winning the mile in 1910 he subsequently retired from competition. A master engineer who spoke five languages, Voigt sailed for Australia in 1911, where he became one of the pioneers of radio, setting up his own broadcasting station specializing in wrestling commentaries, and he served for 12 years as President of the Australian Federation of Broadcasting Stations. He began to compete again, however briefly, and won the Victorian Championships in the mile in 1912. He started the “Olympic Self-Massage Course” and published a book, Self-Massage: The Way to Greater Health, Virility, and Happiness. While in Australia, Voigt also started Voigt & King, mechanical engineers, at Armadale. He moved back to England and during World War I ran a welding and brazing works in Manchester. Returning to Australia in 1921, he was active in politics and the development of radio and radio stations down under. He served as director and president of several radio stations and several associations of stations. In his bio in the Australian Dictionary of Biography, historian Chris Cunneen notes that Voigt was, “A restless, contradictory idealist, he had served Australia’s early wireless industry and fought in the cockpit of 1920s Sydney Labor politics.” His granddaughter commented of his political career, which was investigated by the Australian authorities, “He was thought to be a Marxist, but this was never proven. He did a lot to improve working conditions and help the underdog.” In 1948 Voigt moved to New Zealand, where he continued with his various business interests until his death at the age of 90.

She was originally coached by her father, Charles Norelius, who swam for Sweden at the 1906 Olympics. She was the top U.S swimmer from 1924-1929 with her fame resting primarily on her Olympic accomplishments. In 1924 at Paris, she won the 400 metre freestyle event, and in 1928 she defended that championship, winning the final with a world record of 5:42.8. Through 2016, she is the only woman to have defended the 400 metre event at the Olympics. At the 1928 Olympics, Norelius won her third gold medal when she swam on the 4 x 100 metre freestyle relay team. Norelius won 11 individual Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) titles between 1925 and 1929, and between 1925 and 1928 set 19 world records and 30 American records. In 1929 Norelius was suspended by the AAU for giving an exhibition in the same pool as some professionals. She therefore decided to turn professional herself and won the $10,000 Wrigley Marathon in Toronto. While there she met Joe Wright, one of Canada’s greatest rowers. Wright had won an Olympic silver medal for Canada in the 1928 double sculls, and also played professional football with the Toronto Argonauts of the Canadian Football League. Norelius and Wright were subsequently married on 15 March 1930, although they later divorced.","Daughter-in-law of Joe Wright, Sr. Wife (divorced) of Joe Wright, Jr. Daughter of Charles Norelius Sister-in-law of George Wright Listed in Olympians Who Set a World Record in Long Course Swimming (200 m freestyle – 28 February 1926 - 6 March 1930: 2:40.6 (28 February 1926; Miami, USA); 400 m freestyle – 23 January 1927 - 3 February 1931: 5:51.4 (23 January 1927; Coral Gables, USA), 5:49.6 (30 June 1928; New York City, USA), 5:42.8 (6 August 1928; Amsterdam, NED), 5:39.2 (27 August 1928; Wien, AUT); 800 m freestyle – 7 August 1926 - 10 August 1929: 12:47.2 (7 August 1926; Philadelphia, USA), 12:17.8 (31 July 1927; Massapequa, USA); 1500 m freestyle – 28 July 1927 - 15 July 1931: 23:44.6 (28 July 1927; Massapequa, USA); 4×100 m freestyle relay – 9 August 1928 - 12 August 1932: 4:47.6 (9 August 1928; Amsterdam, NED))"

They were the sons of Costante, a cavalry marshal who trained young horsemen. He was considered an extraordinary instructor but sadly was killed in a motor vehicle accident when he was just 58. Raimondo, like his brother, did not show great interest in horses until reaching adolescence. In the early 1940s Raimondo joined the military world as a Carabiniere and, after World War II, he served as an officer with the Savoia Cavalry department, and dedicated himself to horse racing and eventing competitions. The D’Inzeo brothers were the first Olympians to compete in eight Olympic Games, a mark since equalled by only five Olympians, and later bettered only by Canadian horseman Ian Millar, with 10 through 2012, and Austrian sailor Hubert Raudaschl, who competed in nine. Raimondo D’Inzeo’s participation was continuous between 1948 and 1976. During that time he won six Olympic medals including an individual show jumping gold in 1960 at Rome when his brother won the silver medal. Raimondo’s other medals were silvers in 1956, in both the individual and team jumping event, and team bronzes in 1960, 1964, and 1972. In addition, D’Inzeo was the world individual jumping champion in both 1956 and 1960, and was a silver medallist in that event in 1955, and bronze medallist in 1966. He won eight International Grand Prix events between 1956-75. D’Inzeo was a career officer in the Italian cavalry and he always rode in military uniform. In the winter of 1966 he suffered personal tragedy when his only daughter Alessandra died following a skiing accident at Cortina d’Ampezzo. She was only 12-years-of-age at the time.",Brother of Piero D'Inzeo Listed in Olympians Who Received the Italian Olympic Association (CONI) Gold Medal ()

He coached them for three seasons and helped them to win their second ever La Liga title in 1945. He retired as a coach in 1947, but stayed at the club in different positions, mainly as manager or scout. Samitier was a close friend of Francisco Franco and it is said that this friendship was helpful to transfer László Kubala to FC Barcelona. In 1960 Samitier quit his job at Barcelona after conflicts and moved again to Real Madrid where he worked as a scout, but he returned to Barcelona in 1962. There he remained as a scout until his 1972 death. In 1993 a street was named after him near the Camp Nou Stadium.",

After being sentenced to three years in prison for robbery and assault he used his time inside to turn his life around. After his release he devoted his time to amateur boxing and to his education. He eventually graduated with degrees in sports science and leisure management from London’s Brunel University. Harrison began to achieve success as a boxer at national level from 1997 onwards and became a regular competitor at major championships. Whilst he made little progress at World or European championship he was crowned Commonwealth Games champion in 1998 and qualified for the Sydney Olympics, albeit at the last possible opportunity. The defining contest of his successful Olympic campaign was probably his first. Trailing European Champion Aleksey Lyozin 7-5 at the end of round 3, Harrison floored the Russian with a left hook and the fight was stopped with Lyozin still groggy on the ropes. The other three fights were relatively straightforward for the British boxer although he was later revealed to have fought with a serious knuckle injury. Harrison was forced to take a year away from fighting to recuperate before turning professional as a self-managed fighter. He won his first 19 professional fights and even claimed a world championship of a sort when he won the obscure World Boxing Federation heavyweight title. Harrison then took a step in class to face former world title challenger Danny Williams and lost his unbeaten record via a split points decision. His career appeared to stall after this and he lost as many as he won over the next couple of years. Following a run of victories against modest opposition he secured a shot at the vacant European heavyweight title and duly claimed the title with a dramatic final round knockout. This in turn earned him an opportunity to fight fellow countryman David Haye for the world title in 2011. The fight ended badly for Harrison as, after barely landing a punch on his foe, he was knocked out in the third round.",Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the British Empire/Commonwealth Games (1–0–0 1998 Kuala Lumpur BOX gold: super-heavyweight +91 kg (competed for England)) Listed in Olympians Who Were Sent to Prison (Jailed for robbery in his teens)

Whilst still a teenager in 1986 he set the fastest 200 metre time of the year by a European though he still lacked the consistency to succeed at championship level. This changed the following year and he led the final of the 200 metres at the World Championship in Rome for all but the final few metres and took home a bronze medal. Regis could not pass the semi-finals at the Seoul Olympics but did win a silver medal as part of the sprint relay quartet. He was world indoor champion over 200 m in 1989 and then had probably his best season in 1990. Starting with relay gold and an individual 200 silver representing England at the Commonwealth Games he proceeded to become the first man to win four medals at a single European Championships. Regis won the 200 and was a part of the victorious 4×400 relay team whilst also adding silver in the sprint relay and bronze over 100. Although he rarely ran individual 400 metre races he became a valuable member of the British 4×400 relay team and helped them become world champions in 1991 and Olympic bronze medallists in Barcelona. He again came close to a world championship 200 m title in 1993 when, although he broke 20 seconds, he was beaten into second place by Namibian Frankie Fredericks. Regis also added another silver medal in the sprint relay. He broke the British record at altitude in July 1994 but missed the European Championships due to injury and was again edged out by Fredericks at that year’s Commonwealth Games. He reached the final of the 1995 World Championships but began to be troubled with injuries and, barring a return to the medal podium at the 1998 Commonwealth Games, his days near the top of the rankings gradually came to an end. Regis made an unsuccessful attempt to make the 2002 Winter Games in the four-man bobsleigh before concentrating on his sports management business. He was partner with Linford Christie in the Nuff Respect agency before branching out with his own company. The Regis family encompasses a number of sportsmen and sportswomen in addition to John.

47389,Eric Seward,Male,6 July 1891,,, Great Britain,GBR,"Although he was born in Australia the son of a wine merchant, Eric Seward was of Irish descent. As a youngster he suffered from double pneumonia and on the advice of a Harley Street doctor the family moved to the bracing air of Hastings on England’s south coast. He started swimming at Hastings baths at the age of 13 and within three years was a top class swimmer, diver and water polo player and in 1908 he scored 20 of the 37 goals scored by the Hastings junior team. In addition, he tried his hand at rowing and was a cox at the local rowing club. A proficient backstroke swimmer Seward was chosen for the 1908 London Olympics and when he entered the pool for his opening heat of the 100 metres it was just ten days after his 17th birthday, making him the youngest British competitor at the Games. Sadly, he failed to qualify and was eliminated after just one race. His swimming career suffered a severe blow in 1912 when his lungs were badly damaged following a motor car accident. He tried to join the Army but was unsuccessful so he took up flying, obtained his flying licence in 1915, and was accepted into the Royal Flying Corps. He served in Palestine and following an accident in 1917 that saw his plane ditch in the sea, he swam four miles to the shore before walking about 25 miles to safety. A picture of him, entitled “The Seward Exploit,” hung in the Imperial War Museum from 1920-39 and showed a crashed plane in the Red Sea with its pilot (Seward) swimming away from it under a hail of gunfire. He was awarded the Military Cross before retiring form the RAF in 1921 and then enjoyed a successful business career.",

At the 1972 Olympics, Vedenin first won gold in the 30 km, becoming the first Soviet male skier to win an individual Olympic title, and then placed third behind Norwegians Pål Tyldum and Magne Myrmo in the 50 km. Three days after his bronze in the 50 km, Vedenin skied the anchor leg for the Soviets in the relay. After three legs, the Norwegians had a comfortable lead, over a minute ahead of the Soviet Union, but Vedenin managed to reduce the gap to only 30 seconds after 5 km, and he continued to increase his pace, catching Norwegian anchor Johs Harviken only 100 metres from the line. While trying to counterattack, Harviken fell, and Vedenin, with the fastest leg of the competition, won an Olympic relay gold for the Soviet Union, ten seconds ahead of Norway. In 1972 Vedenin also won the Vasaloppet and continued to ski a few more seasons until an injury put an end to his sporting career. Domestically Vedenin won 13 Soviet titles – one at 15 km (1969), four at 50 km (1967-69, 1972), two at 70 km (1969, 1970) and six in the relay (1966, 1968-70, 1972, 1973).

He was even named after French skiing star Alain Penz. Baxter learned to ski at the age of two and was a member of the national team at the age of sixteen. He made his World Cup debut in 1996 but did not break into the top 100 of the slalom world rankings when he posted two top thirty finishes at the World Championships. After steady improvement he had a breakthrough season in 2000-01 where he recorded what was to be his best World Cup performance of 4th in the final slalom of the season. Results were mixed in 2001-02 but at the Olympic Games he took advantage of an early start position in the 2nd run of the slalom and watched as other skiers struggled in the worsening conditions to the point where he ended the event as the first Briton to win an Olympic medal on snow as opposed to ice. A few weeks after the Games it was announced that his sample had tested positive for methamphetamine. The explanation given was that the methamphetamine was contained in a nasal decongestant that differed between the American and European markets. Whilst the European version did not contain any ingredient that would cause a doping positive Baxter had purchased an inhaler in Utah which contained an inactive isomer of methamphetamine. The FIS banned Baxter for three months, although that was later rescinded by the Court of Arbitration of Sport, and the IOC stripped him of his Olympic medal. Although he raced on for another six seasons he never returned to the level success he reached in prior to the 2002 Olympics and retired after the 2009 season. His last race before retirement was the slalom at the British Championship, a race where he competed wearing a kilt over his ski-suit and stopped before the finish line to take a “wee dram o’ whisky”.

During his amateur career he won 188 bouts, losing just eight, and five more being drawn. He was a sports photographer from 1965-90 for the daily newspaper Neues Deutschland and covered eight Olympic Games and countless World and European Championships, as well as winning several exhibition prizes for his work. At Seoul in 1988, he met up with his 1956 opponent Song. From 1970-90 Behrendt was a member of the NOC of the former GDR, and after their dissolution a member of the NOC of the reunited Germany for 14 years. After reunification, he worked as a freelance photographer for several newspapers. Later he concentrated on music and worked as a music clown in several varieties. His son Mario participated as a bantamweight boxer in the 1980 Moskva Games. For the 1956 Olympic success Behrendt should have been awarded the Silver Bay Leaf by West German national president Theodor Heuss, which was a unique historical award at the time, but influences from the Cold War prevented it. When Behrendt attempted to leave Berlin to fly to Bonn, two sports administrators from the former GDR stopped him at the airport, so the Silver Bay Leaf was never presented to him.",Father of Mario Behrendt

In 1967, he entered a Brabham in Formula 2 races, racing for his own team, Witley. A win at Hockenheim (Germany) was his best result that year. More minor successes in Formula 2 the next year – now driving a McLaren - meant he was asked by the Cooper team to drive their second car at the British GP at Brands Hatch. Widdows qualified as 18th of the 20 cars for what would turn out to be his only Formula 1 GP. After 34 laps, his ignition failed, and he had to abandon the race.

Česiūnas formed a strong partnership with Yury Lobanov, with the pair winning the gold medal in the C-2 1,000 metres at the 1972 München Olympics. The two of them then won four gold medals at the Flatwater World Championships, winning the C-2 10,000 metres title in 1973–75 and the C-2 1,000 metres title in 1974. They also won silver in the C-2 1,000 metres in 1973, and Česiūnas won an individual bronze in the C-1 1,000 metres in 1971. During the 1970s Česiūnas was a six-time Soviet champion and was named the athlete of the year in Lithuania in 1973 and 1974. In 1979 Česiūnas was in attendance as a spectator at the Canoe Sprint World Championships in Duisburg, West Germany. While the German and Soviet accounts of what happened differ, it was claimed that Česiūnas had met a Lithuanian‐born woman in West Germany and later moved in with her. Shortly after he was interviewed by a Lithuanian-language newspaper, published in Chicago, where he said he was planning to make embarrassing disclosures about Soviet sports ahead of the 1980 Moskva Olympics. The Soviet press agency stated that Česiūnas had been made to stay in West Germany against his will, before reaching the Soviet Embassy in Bonn, and then taken home to the Soviet Union by the KGB. In an interview with the Los Angeles Times in 2002 Česiūnas said that he left West Germany on his own accord and returned home voluntarily. Once back in the Soviet Union he was threatened with being sent to a prison camp for 15 years of hard labour, but was not imprisoned. Česiūnas lost his job in the customs department where he worked and was made to take a civilian job as coach at a children’s sports school. After the breakup of the Soviet Union Česiūnas was awarded with the Order of the Cross of Vytis and the Commemorative Medal. He later returned to his job in customs, becoming the head of shifts in 2002.","Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the Canoe Sprint World Championships (4–1–1 1971 Beograd bronze: C1 1000 m; 1973 Tampere gold: C2 10000 m, silver: C2 1000 m; 1974 Ciudad de México gold: C2 1000 m and C2 10000 m; 1975 Beograd gold: C2 10000 m)"

He went on to be an outstanding horseman either as a hunter, jumper, polo player or amateur National Hunt jockey. Little surprise that his lengthy Military career saw him become an established cavalry officer and he spent his entire Army career serving in a cavalry post of one form or another. Although born in Ireland, Brooke was educated at Haileybury and then went to the Royal Military College, from where he was Gazetted into the 16th Lancers in 1903. He went on ultimately to reach the rank of major-general in the 16th/5th Lancers. In 1911 Brooke was appointed an assistant instructor at the Cavalry School until the outbreak of World War I, when he was posted to France with the British expeditionary force in August 1914, and fought at both the first and second Battles of Ypres. It was reported incorrectly in 1918 that he had been killed in action. After the War, Brooke became chief instructor of the Cavalry Wing at the Weedon Equitation School until taking command of his own regiment once again, before being appointed in command of the Cavalry Force in Egypt. During his time in Egypt, Brooke and his wife helped with the repatriation of old war horses. Brooke received many awards. Apart from being mentioned in dispatches five times, he was awarded the Distinguished Service Order (DSO) and Bar, was awarded the Military Cross (MC), and was made a Companion, Order of the Bath (CB). Between 1934-35 he was Aide de Camp to King George V, and between 1935-39 was Inspector General of the Cavalry in India As a horseman, Brooke had many notable show jumping victories to his name. He won the officers jumping competition at The Royal Tournament at Olympia in 1920, and the following year won the King’s Cup at the International Horse Show, again at Olympia. On that occasion, he rode “Combined Training” who he had with him while serving in France and the pair won many jumping events behind lines during breaks in the fighting. Also in 1921, Brooke was in the Great Britain team, with Lieutenant Morrison and Colonel Graham, that won the Prince of Wales’s Cup at the International Horse Show. In 1924 Brooke was captain of the British team that won the Prince of Wales’s Cup again, this time accompanied by Edward Fonblanque and fellow-Olympian Capel Brunker. In addition to riding horses, Brooke was a prolific writer on the subject of horses and horsemanship and had many books published between 1924-55.",

The year of 1932 was to become a memorable one when he claimed bronze at the 1932 Los Angeles Olympics after another jump-off (just months after he married his wife Maximiana). Toribio stayed in California and graduated in civil engineering from the University of Southern California. After his success at the 1932 Olympic Games, Toribio was selected as the Filipino flag bearer at the Opening Ceremony in Berlin in 1936 In 1930, he was awarded the title “Asia’s Greatest Athlete” and was later voted Filipino Field Athlete of Half Century. During the War, he was active in an underground army and narrowly escaped being arrested by the Japanese Military Police. The Japanese officer saw one of his souvenirs from a competition presented to him by the Japanese Emperor, and because of that and the fact that it was the emperor’s birthday, Toribio was released. He later became an acknowledged civil engineer and Congressional representative for the province of Bohol in the Parliament of the Philippines from 1941-53. As a sports administrator, he served as vice president of the Philippine Amateur Athletic Federation from 1955 to 1959.

8719,Sugar Ray Leonard,Male,17 May 1956,178.0,62, United States,USA,"Sugar Ray Leonard was one of the most popular fighters of our time. He was christened Ray Charles Leonard, because, he explains, “I was supposed to be a singer.” But he turned out to be quite a boxer. Sugar Ray held numerous titles by the time he made it to the Olympics. He was twice (1974-75) North American amateur champion, twice (1973-74) Golden Gloves champion, twice (1974-75) AAU champion, and he won a gold medal at the 1975 Pan American Games. He won his gold in Montréal rather easily. Leonard originally stated he would not turn pro, but instead accept a scholarship to attend the University of Maryland. But the financial lure of professional boxing was too much and he turned pro in 1977. Leonard immediately became one of the top welterweights and a media favorite with his good looks, quick smile, and pleasant personality. In 1979 Ray Leonard won his first world title by defeating Wilfred Benitez for the WBA version of the welterweight championship. He lost the title in 1980 to Roberto Duran in what would prove to be his only loss as a professional. In a re-match later in 1980, Leonard regained the title from Duran by a TKO in the eighth round. In 1981 Leonard fought Tommy Hearns to take the WBC version of the welterweight crown and unify the title. He won the fight and realized the largest payday ever for a professional athlete when he took home an estimated $10 million. Leonard later also won the light middleweight title in 1981 by defeating Ayub Kalule. Leonard fought his “last” fight in early 1982. While training for a subsequent fight he noticed vision problems and his doctors diagnosed a detached retina. Surgery corrected this problem but rather than risk future damage, Sugar Ray retired from the ring. The retirement was short-lived and Leonard returned to the ring in May 1984. In May 1986, in another “superfight”, Leonard won a controversial decision over middleweight champion, Marvelous Marvin Hagler, winning the WBC middleweight title. Leonard then retired but came back briefly in 1988 and fought thru 1991, winning both the WBC super-middleweight and light-heavyweight titles. After another “retirement” Leonard came back in 1997 and was decisively beaten by Hector “Macho” Camacho. Leonard eventually claimed professional world titles in five weight classes.","Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the Summer Pan American Games (1–0–0 1975 Ciudad de México BOX gold: light-welterweight -63.5 kg) Listed in Olympic Boxers Who Won a Professional World Championship (Olympics - 1976 Light-welterweight (Gold); Professional World Champion - WBC Light-Heavyweight (1988-1988); WBC Middleweight (1987-1987); WBC Super-Middleweight (1988-1990); WBA Super-Welterweight (1981-1981); WBC Welterweight (1979-1980); WBC Welterweight (1980-1982); WBA Welterweight (1981-1982).)

67993,Marie-José Pérec,Female,9 May 1968,180.0,60, France,FRA,"The “Gazelle” from the Caribbean island of Guadeloupe started out as a basketball player until she was discovered as a track athlete. Initially a 200 metre runner, Marie-José Péréc’s breakthrough came in the 400 metres at the 1988 French Championships. Her star soon rose, winning the 200 m at the 1989 European Indoor Championships, and gaining a bronze at the outdoor Europeans (400 m) in Split, 1990. Her first great victory was at the Tokyo World Championships in 1991, when she defeated Germany’s Grit Breuer to win the world title. She confirmed her status at the Olympics the next year, winning gold in Barcelona. An attempt to switch back to the 200 failed somewhat, as Pérec placed only fourth at the 1993 Worlds. In 1994, she again raced in the 400, winning both the individual and relay events at the European Championships. The following year, she also regained her world title, while also trying her hand at the 400 hurdles – in which she broke the French national record. For the 1996 Olympics, Pérec again set her sights at both the 200 and 400 metres. She wished to emulate the performance of Valerie Brisco-Hooks, who had won both events in 1984. Pérec won “her” 400 m event in a great battle with Cathy Freeman, with both athletes finishing below 49 seconds. Pérec’s 48.25 was her fastest ever 400 m, and as of 2012 remained the third fastest 400 ever (behind Marita Koch and Jarmila Kratochvílová). In the 200 final, Pérec faced the formidable Merlene Ottey, who was out of the blocks the fastest. But the tall Frenchwoman caught her in the closing meters to win the double, shortly before Michael Johnson would do the same (albeit in world record time). After Atlanta, Pérec’s career went downhill due to injuries and illness. She had to abandon the 1997 World Championships due to injury in the heats, and missed most of the 1998 and 1999 seasons, running less impressive times when she did compete. Qualifying for the 2000 Sydney Olympics, Pérec became the target of Australian journalists who saw her as the major opponent for local favorite Freeman. After she was harrassed at her hotel (she did not stay at the Olympic Village), she decided to leave the country, together with her boyfriend, US Olympian Anthuan Maybank. Still followed by journalists at their stopover in Singapore, Maybank attacked one of their followers, resulting in a minor scandal. Although Pérec did not officially retire until 2004, she rarely competed after Sydney, again suffering from injuries. In 2010, Pérec gave birth to a son, the father being French Winter Olympic medallist Sébastien Foucras.

In an era of mostly natural ice, this allowed him to train abroad in countries with better ice guarantees, such as Switzerland and Norway. Having a disposition towards the shorter distances, Van der Elst did not feature in many international championships, with the 1952 Olympics as the sole exception. In Oslo, he ranked 19th (500 m) and 26th (1,500 m). The Rotterdam-born Van der Elst also featured in two country matches, one versus Sweden and once in “Norway vs. Rest of the World”. In national competition, he won second place in the 1954 Dutch allround championships (winning the 500 m). That same year, he also placed 3rd in the 1,500 m at the Jonkheer van Karnebeek challenge cup, a competition between the Dutch national team skaters.

68611,Mary Bignal-Rand,Female,10 February 1940,173.0,61, Great Britain,GBR,"After finishing second in the English Schools long jump in 1955, Mary Bignall accepted a sports scholarship to Millfield School, where she developed her precocious talents. In 1957, as a 17-year-old schoolgirl, she set an English record in her first ever pentathlon competition and later in the season made her international debut as a high jumper. In 1958, after leaving Millfield, she joined the London Olympiads AC and finished second in the long jump and fifth in the high jump at the British Empire and Commonwealth Games. In the pentathlon at the European Championships, although finishing no higher than seventh, she posted a new British record of 4466 points. In 1959 she became the first British woman long jumper to clear 20 feet, with a new-British record of 20-4 (6.20 m), and improved her pentathlon record to 4679 points. In May 1960 Bignall added another inch to her British long jump record and a gold medal at the Rome Olympics in August seemed a distinct possibility. Hopes were raised further when she led the qualifiers in Rome at 6.33 (20-9¼) but things went drastically wrong in the final. She ran through the pit on her first two attempts and a half-hearted last jump left her back in ninth place with a performance more than a foot behind her qualifying jump. Although she finished fourth in the 80 metres hurdles, the Rome Olympics were a stunning disappointment. Fortunately she had the character to put this setback behind her and produced some superlative performances during the four years she had to wait before getting a second chance of Olympic honors. After the Rome Games she married the Olympic oarsman Sidney Rand, and only four months after the birth of their daughter, Mary Rand was winning bronze medals in the long jump and the 4×100 metres relay (with Ann Packer, Dorothy Hyman, and Daphne Arden) at the 1962 European Championships. In 1963 she twice improved both her British long jump and pentathlon records and after bettering each record again in the summer of 1964, she went to Tokyo in October to try again for Olympic gold. As in Rome four years earlier, Mary Rand led the qualifiers, but this time there were no mistakes in the final. With her first jump she set a new Olympic and British record, improving on this with her fourth jump, and on her fifth she virtually put the gold medal beyond the reach of her rivals with a new world record of 6.76 (22-2¼). To crown this wonderful performance, she won a silver medal in the pentathlon and completed her set of Olympic medals with a bronze in the relay. She carried on competing for the next three seasons, winning the British Empire and Commonwealth Games long jump title and finished eighth in the high jump in 1966, but injury prevented her from making the Olympic team for a third time in 1968 and she announced her retirement. Her marriage to Sidney Rand ended in divorce and in 1969 she married the 1968 Olympic decathlon champion Bill Toomey, but this marriage was also subsequently dissolved.

After graduating from the Chelyabinsk Pedagogical Institute in 1965, Popkova established herself as the best Soviet female sprinter by winning national 100 m titles in 1966 and 1967, 200 m titles in 1965 and 1966 and 4×100 m titles in 1963, 1967 and 1968.

Selected for the 1954 British Empire and Commonwealth Games, he found himself too poor to attend and took up rowing instead, beginning his career as a spare on the University of British Columbia’s coxed eights crew, alongside Donald Arnold, Lorne Loomer, and Archie MacKinnon. As part of their training they were sent to compete in the coxless fours event at the Canadian Olympic trials, where they surprisingly won the right to represent Canada at the 1956 Summer Games. At the Olympics they took gold in the coxless fours, nearly ten seconds ahead of the Americans, and in just over a year since D’Hondt first took up rowing. Their next stop was the 1958 British Empire and Commonwealth Games, where they earned gold as members of the eights crew (coxed by Sohen Biln), while Arnold, Biln, and D’Hondt, with David Helliwell and the non-Olympian Lawrence Stapleton, captured silver in the coxed fours. D’Hondt’s final major international tournament was the 1960 Summer Olympics, where he won silver, Canada’s only medal at the Games, in the coxed eights with Arnold, Biln, MacKinnon, David Anderson, Nelson Kuhn, John Lecky, Bill McKerlich, and Glen Mervyn. He eventually moved to the United States and took up an engineering position with Boeing in Seattle. He has been inducted into Canada’s Sports (1957), the Canadian Olympic (1958), the British Columbia Sports (1966), and the University of British Columbia Sports (1993) Halls of Fame with his gold medal-winning crew. He was inducted a second time in the the British Columbia (1977) and University of British Columbia (2012) Sports Halls of Fame for his 1960 Olympic achievement.","Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the Summer Pan American Games (0–1–0 1959 Chicago ROW silver: eights) Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the British Empire/Commonwealth Games (1–1–0 1958 Cardiff ROW gold: eights, silver: coxed fours)"

He was commissioned into the 16th Lancers as a second lieutenant in 1896 and served in the 1898-1901 South African War. He was seriously wounded in his arm in September 1900, and was subsequently mentioned in dispatches. Van Der Byl also served in World War I, originally with the Lancers before being promoted to major in the Army Cyclist Corps, and was mentioned in dispatches for a second time. He was also awarded the British and Victory medals, and the 1914 Star. Van Der Byl was a good all-round sportsman, and at university was a fine athlete, specialising in the high jump. He later came second in the officers’ high jump competition at the 1908 Army Championships at Aldershot. Van Der Byl also played cricket and rackets, and helped organise and referee boxing tournaments during his time in the Army. His other great passion was hunting, and he owned a string of good hunting horses. As a fencer, Van Der Byl won many trophies at the Épée Club, where he was a member and, after winning the officers sabre versus sabre event at the Royal Naval and Military Tournament at Olympia, he carried off the British sabre title at The Sword Club in 1912, without losing an assault in the final. That year, Van Der Byl represented Great Britain at the Stockholm Olympics and also took part in the Ostend International Tournament, won by France. In later life, Van Der Byl was passionate about the way rabbits were snared in traps inhumanely, and he sought a ban on Gin Traps. He set about inventing a trap capable of catching rabbits without causing them distress and unnecessary suffering. He wrote leaflets telling people how to humanely kill rabbits, poultry, and other animals. He crusaded right up to time of his death, despite having been crippled with arthritis for many years. Gin Traps were eventually banned in Britain two years after Van Der Byl’s death. In 1937, Van Der Byl published his book My Fifty Years in Sport.",

From a sporting background, her father was involved in ice hockey whilst her mother competed in table tennis; she was born in the city of Changchun in Northeastern China. She won the first of her 10 Chinese national championships in 1989 shortly after her 13th birthday and went on to bronze medals at both the 1991 and 1992 World Junior Championships. In the senior ranks she burst through to prominence at the Albertville Olympic Games where many thought she was unlucky to be placed only in sixth. A few weeks later she became the first Chinese skater to win a medal at the World Championship when she placed third in Oakland. Chen seemed to specialize in winning bronze at that time in her career as she repeated the feat at the 1993 World Championships and then at the Lillehammer Olympics in 1994. Like her World Championship bronze, her Olympic bronze was the first medal won by a Chinese skater at that level. Her final breakthrough occurred with a victory at the 1995 World Championship but her results soon began to tail off. She had a brief renaissance at the 1996 World Championship and placed second behind Michelle Kwan but injuries and a breakdown in the relationship between she and her coach combined to cause a loss of form. Having already indicated she would retire from the amateur ranks after the 1998 Winter Olympics she unexpectedly proved to be a major medal contender at Nagano. The judges were split three ways as far as the bronze medal position was concerned so Chen, despite being the consensus fourth place finisher, earned enough ordinals to win bronze ahead of the Russian pair of Irina Slutskaya and Mariya Butyrskaya who divided the judges’ opinion thoroughly enough to cost both the chance of the medal.

Fadzayev, who took up wrestling in 1976 and competed in the freestyle lightweight division his entire career, rarely lost a match. After winning the 1981 European Junior Championships and 1982 World Junior Championships, Fadzayev was selected for the Soviet national team in 1983 and was considered the favorite for the 1984 freestyle lightweight title, but the Soviet boycott put an end to his Olympic hopes. Instead, in 1984 he competed at the Friendship Games and won gold in the freestyle lightweight class. Fadzayev made his début in the Olympic arena four years later as a favorite, won the gold medal, and repeated that victory in 1992. In addition to his Olympic victories, Fadzayev was a six-time World Champion (1983, 1985-87, 1990-91) and a four-time European Champion (1984-85, 1987-88). He also won the World Cup in 1983, 1985, 1986 and 1989 and silver at the 1989 Worlds. Domestically, Fadzayev won four Soviet titles (1983, 1986, 1989, 1990). Fadzayev retired from sports after the 1992 Olympics and from 1992-96 worked as a wrestling coach with CSKA Moskva and the Russian national team. In 1996, however, Fadzayev decided to make a comeback and compete in his third Olympics. After not making the 1996 Russian Olympic team, Fadzayev, a graduate of the Uzbek National Physical Culture Institute, used his connections in that country to get Uzbek citizenship and went to the 1996 Olympics representing Uzbekistan. At the Olympics, however, the former champion was clearly past his prime and lost two of his three matches, failing to advance to the medal round. After the 1996 Olympics, Fadzayev started to work as deputy director of the Federal Tax Police Service of the Russian Federation in North Ossetia and later worked as deputy director of the Federal Tax Police Service of the Russian Federation in Northern Caucasus. In the 2000s Fadzayev entered politics and, after serving two terms in North Ossetian parliament, was elected to the Russian State Duma (parliament) in 2003, where he was deputy chairman of the parliamentary Committee on Physical Culture, Sport and Youth Affairs and a member of the Commission on the North Caucasus. Fadzayev was re-elected to the State Duma in 2007 and served as its deputy chairman of the parliamentary Committee on CIS Affairs and Relations with Compatriots, but was not re-elected to the State Duma in 2011. In 1997 he also founded the wrestling club Alany in Vladikavkaz and has headed it since. In 2003 Fadzayev was one of the first 10 inductees elected to the FILA International Wrestling Hall of Fame.","Listed in Olympians Who Were Members of National Legislatures (Member of Russian Duma from 2003 through 2011 (SPS, Edinaya Rossiya))"

As a 16-year-old, he won 31 races from four to ten miles. Len’s brother Joe was 13 years older and was also a semi-professional athlete. The two brothers moved to London where there was more opportunity to race, and to subsidise their income as part-time athletes they worked in a brickworks with Len being a brick maker. Len became a full-time professional in 1889 while Joe preferred the security of regular income and stayed semi-professional but shortly afterwards Len was hit by illness which resulted in being out of the professional ranks for nearly three years. Upon his return he specialised in longer events but the lack of top class distance events in Britain meant Len raced on the continent and following the success of the Marathon at the 1896 Olympics, the inaugural Paris Marathon was established a few months later and Len had the honour of the being the race’s first winner. He won in 2 hours 31 minutes 29.8 seconds, a full 27 minutes faster than Spyros Louis’ winning time in the Olympics. Len was one of the first athletes to have a strict training and dietary regime and he was a contributor to Alf Downer’s book Running Recollections and How to Train. His approach to the sport paid off as he became one of the best long distance runners in the world at the turn of the Century, and he won the Paris Marathon again in 1900 and 1901. In 1903 he won the first professional London to Brighton Race, covering the 52.5 miles in 6 hours 32 minutes 34 seconds, a time that stood as a record for 21 years. Since the 1950s, the winning team in the London-Brighton race is presented with the Len Hurst Belt, which is the actual belt Hurst received for winning the 1903 race. Len’s last race of significance was the Madison Square Garden 6-Day Race in New York. Although Len and brother Joe were one of the 43 two-man teams to enter they did not win event but Len covered 597 miles in six days. He retired fully from racing after failing to finish a 30-mile race in December 1907. His career saw him win more than 200 handicap races from the scratch position, and in his 20-year carer it is estimated he won over £30,000. After retiring he became landlord of the Eagle Hotel in Finsbury, London and from 1911, until the time of his death, he was landlord of the Neptune in Camden Town.",

As the new decathlon was not contested much outside of Sweden before the Games, Hugo Wieslander, who had won three Swedish decathlons in 1911-12 in preparation for the Olympic Games, was considered a favorite. However, at the Olympic Games, Jim Thorpe won the new decathlon easily, defeating Wieslander by almost 700 points. A week before the decathlon, Wieslander had also finished seventh in pentathlon, also won by Thorpe. Wieslander had already competed at the 1908 Olympics in five events, his best finish being fifth in freestyle javelin throw. He also won four Swedish titles – in high jump (1907), decathlon (1909) and pentathlon (1910 and 1911) and placed second-third eight times in various jumping and throwing events at the Swedish championships in 1906-08. In 1913 Wieslander passed the state surveying exam and became employed by the Swedish cartography agency where he worked until his retirement. In January 1913, the news also broke that Thorpe had played minor league baseball in North Carolina in 1909 and 1910. The United States’ AAU reacted quickly and declared Thorpe a professional, with the IOC following suit and awarded the decathlon gold medal to Wieslander. For many years Wieslander was uncomfortable with keeping the 1912 gold medal and contemplated returning it to Thorpe. He finally reconsidered, and in 1951 donated it to the sports museum at the Swedish School of Sport and Health Sciences. In 1954 it was stolen from there and never recovered. In 1982, the International Olympic Committee made partial restitution when they restored Thorpe’s amateur status, and declared him, in an unusual ruling, decathlon co-champion with Wieslander.

Ellen Osiier won all her final bouts, as she had done in the preliminary rounds, and won the gold medal undefeated, while Heckscher took third place. As of 2010, Osiier’s gold medal remains Denmark’s only Olympic title in the sport. The Olympic gold remained Ellen Osiier’s only title, as World or European Championships for women were not held yet, and the tough competition at home meant she never won a Danish championship either.

He was initially introduced to baseball in the Cap-Pelé minor system, but after a season or two, one of his coaches, eyeing the promise in the youngster, suggested his game would improve even more if he tried out for minor baseball in the nearby city of Moncton, which Rhéal, with the support of his parents, did. That proved to be a wise decision as he continued to excel there and eventually made the Canadian National Junior team in 1985. His efforts with the National Junior team eventually led to him being recruited by Rhode Island Community College, where in two seasons he compiled a record of 19 and 1. Those numbers drew the attention of major league scouts, and in 1988 he was drafted by the St. Louis Cardinals. Following two and a half seasons in the minors, Cormier made his major league debut on August 15, 1991 against the New York Mets, appropriately on National Acadian Day, a game that saw him give up only one run in six innings. That heralded in a major league career that lasted for sixteen seasons. He suited up for a number of teams, including the aforesaid Cardinals, the Boston Red Sox, Montreal Expos, the team he had rooted for as a youngster, the Philadelphia Phillies, where he found his greatest success, and briefly with the Cleveland Indians and Cincinnati Reds, his final professional team. His career numbers over those sixteen seasons were 71 wins, 64 losses, and an ERA of 4.08. In addition to his major league career, Cormier represented his country of Canada at a number of international events. Most notable were his appearances, two decades apart, at the 1988 and 2008 Olympic Games. At the latter Games, in Beijing, and by now 41 years of age, he tossed 2 and 1/3 innings of scoreless baseball. In 2012 he was inducted into the Canadian Baseball Hall of Fame, and in 2014 was also inducted into the New Brunswick Sports Hall of Fame. Cormier, along with his wife and two children, lived in communities in the United States after his retirement, but they maintained a home in Cap-Pelé, as well, where he sadly died after a bout with cancer, at the age of 53. His approach to the world in general was reflected by something he wrote inside the famous outfield wall, the Green Monster at Fenway Park, when he was a member of the Boston Red Sox: “La vie est belle”, translated, “Life is beautiful”.",

6972,David Robinson,Male,6 August 1965,216.0,107, United States,USA,"David Robinson, known as The Admiral because of his service in the US Navy, is considered one of the greatest centers to ever play basketball. Robinson enrolled at the US Naval Academy in 1983, when he was not recruited by major basketball schools. While at Annapolis, he grew from 198 cm (6-6) to 216 cm (7-1), and became a force as a center. Robinson was the #1 overall pick in the 1987 NBA Draft, chosen by the San Antonio Spurs. He had to fulfill a two-year service commitment, which was a Naval Academy compromise, and less than the usual five-year commitment required of Midshipmen. Robinson played for 14 years in the NBA, all with the Spurs, helping them win NBA titles in 1999 and 2003. He was a 10-time NBA All-Star (1990-96, 1998, 2000-01), and was named All-NBA First team in 1991-92, and 1995-96. He was chosen as the NBA’s MVP in 1995 and was NBA Defensive Player of the Year in 1992. Robinson was chosen NBA Rookie of the Year in 1990 and was given the NBA Sportsmanship Award in 2001. He was named to the NBA 50th Anniversary All-Time Team and his #50 was retired by the San Antonio Spurs. During his NBA career, Robinson averaged 21.1 ppg, scoring 20,790 points, and averaged 10.6 rebounds/game. He led the NBA in scoring in 1993/94 with 29.8 ppg, in rebounding in 1990/91 with 13.0 rpg, and in blocked shots in 1991/92 with 4.49 bpg. In 1994, in a game against the Los Angeles Clippers, Robinson scored 71 points, becoming only the fourth NBA player to score 70 or more points in a game, after Elgin Baylor, Wilt Chamberlain, and David Thompson (Kobe Bryant would later join this club, scoring 81 in a game in 2006). In February 1994, in a game against the Detroit Pistons, Robinson became only the fourth NBA player to record a quadruple-double, with 34 points, 10 rebounds, 10 assists, and 10 blocks. Internationally, Robinson played on the 1988 US Olympic team that won a bronze medal, but he is best known for having been a member of the 1992 US Olympic Dream Team, the first time that NBA professionals had been allowed to compete at the Olympics. The Dream Team won the gold medal easily and Robinson again played at the Olympics in 1996, on Dream Team II, becoming the first American man to win three Olympic basketball medals when they also won gold. As a collegian, Robinson also won a silver medal at the 1987 Pan American Games and a gold medal at the 1986 World Championships. The Admiral was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 2009. He was chosen as a member of the US Olympic Hall of Fame in 2008. Both of those were individual honors, but in 2010 and 2009 respectively, the 1992 Dream Team was also chosen for those Halls of Fame.",Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the Summer Pan American Games (0–1–0 1987 Indianapolis BAS silver) Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the Basketball World Cup (1–0–0 1986 ESP gold) Listed in Olympians Who Acted in Movies (Forget Paris; Uncle Drew; Like Mike)

69002,Lynn Davies,Male,20 May 1942,185.0,77, Great Britain,GBR,"After forsaking a promising career as a footballer, Lynn Davies initially specialized in the triple jump but in 1961 he was persuaded by Ron Pickering, the Welsh national coach, to concentrate on long jumping. The wisdom of the decision soon became apparent and the following year Davies made his international debut at the European Championships. Later in 1962, he finished fourth at the Commonwealth Games with a new British record of 25-4 (7.72) and after a year of consolidation Davies was ready for the Tokyo Olympics. He opened the 1964 season with a new British record of 26-3¾ (8.01) in May and then raised the records to 26-4 (8.02) in July. In atrocious weather conditions, Davies won a classic competition in Tokyo to become the first British athlete to win an Olympic gold medal in a field event since Timothy Ahearne’s victory in the triple jump in 1908. Davies’ winning mark of 26-5¾ (8.07) was yet another Commonwealth record. In the post-Olympic year, Davies lost twice to Igor Ter-Ovanesyan and traded wins with Ralph Boston; in 1966, during an early season tour of South Africa, he made two further improvements to the Commonwealth record, finishing with a sin in the South African Championships with a jump of 26-10 (8.18). Later in the year he added the European and Commonwealth titles to his Olympic crown to become the first athlete ever to hold all three titles. In 1967 he won the European indoor title and in 1968 he improved the Commonwealth record to 27-0 (8.23) but his hopes of retaining his Olympic title were shattered by Bob Beamon’s legendary jump in Mexico. After finishing second in both the European indoor and outdoor meetings in 1969, Davies retained his Commonwealth title in 1970 and at Munich in 1972 he made his third Olympic appearance but, handicapped by injury, he failed to qualify for the final. Sometimes overlooked are Davis’ talents as a sprinter; he recorded times of 9.7 seconds for 100 yards and 10.51 seconds for 100 metres. At the 1964 Olympics he ran in the 100 metres and was a member of the relay team which reached the final. Davis, who ranks as one of Britain’s greatest athletes, was awarded the MBE in 1967 and after retiring from competition in 1973 he was appointed technical director of Canadian athletics. He returned home in 1976 and continued to serve the sport in many capacities – he was the assistant manager of the British team at the Moscow Olympics. He had a spell as a BBC television sports commentator and latterly became the President of UK Athletics, the governing body of the sport in Great Britain.

He was an alternate for the relay teams at the 1968 Summer Olympics, but did not compete. At the 1970 Commonwealth Games, however, he took home medals in all of the relays: gold in the 4x100 m medley (alongside Bill Kennedy, Byron MacDonald, and Bill Mahony) and silver in the 4x100 and 4x200 m freestyle (both with Hutton, Jacks, and George Smith). He then captured silver in the 4x100 and 4x200 m freestyle relays at the 1971 Pan American Games (alongside Timothy Bach, Ian MacKenzie, and Brian Phillips in the former, and Hutton, Jacks, and Phillips in the latter), as well as bronze in the 100 m freestyle. He was then selected as the captain of the swim team at the 1972 Summer Olympics, where he won bronze in the 4x100 m medley relay with Kennedy, Mahony, Erik Fish, and Bruce Robertson. He was also fifth in the 4x100 m freestyle relay, alongside Bach, Phillips, and Robertson, and eliminated in the semifinals of the 100 m freestyle and butterfly events. Kasting graduated from Yale University in his Olympic year, having captained the swim team as a senior. He continued to swim for several years after the Games, even as he earned a diploma from the University of Stockholm and entered McGill University to study law, but he failed to qualify for the 1976 Olympic team. He retired from active competition shortly thereafter and was called to the British Columbia bar in 1978.

He was the 10 miles champion five times between 1965-69, 6 miles champion in 1963, and captured the marathon title twice, in 1967 and 1971. In addition, Hill enjoyed seven other podium finishes between 1964 and 1973. Hill was born in Accrington and attended the local grammar school. He was a member of the Clayton-le-Moors club, but after winning a scholarship to Manchester University in 1957, he joined the Bolton United Harriers. He obtained a degree in textile chemistry and stayed on at university to do his Ph.D. By that time he was representing England and Great Britain, and in 1963 he won his first AAA title and also won the 5,000 metre bronze medal at that year’s 1963 Summer Universiade at Porto Alegre. Hill went on to win the gold medal in the marathon at the 1969 Athina European Championships, and the following year, representing England, won the marathon title at the Commonwealth Games in Edinburgh when he became only the second man to run the distance under 2-10. Also in 1970, Hill became the first Briton to win the Boston Marathon, and in a record 2-10:30. At the 1971 Europeans he won the marathon bronze. Unfortunately, Hill never won an Olympic medal, with his sixth place in the 1972 marathon being his best finish. Hill broke world records at 10 and 15 miles, and also 25,000 metres, the first being on his home track at Bolton in 1965, when he deprived Emil Zatopek of his 15 miles and 25k records. He twice broke the 10 miie world record in 1968. Between 1962-68 Hill competed in the International Cross-Country Championship six times and was on the England winning team on each occasion. Individually, he was runner-up in 1964 and 1968, to Paco Aritmendi (Spain) and Mohamad Gammoudi (Tunisia) respectively. Hill won the National Cross-Country title in 1966 and 1968. When Hill ran his last marathon, in the 100th Boston race in 1996, he had accumulated 115 races over the distance since running in, and winning, the 1961 Liverpool Marathon. He re-joined the Clayton-le-Moors club in 1976 and continued to break British over-40 age group records. By the time he had reached the age of 70, Hill had competed in more than 100 countries, including Hong Kong where he went to compete in the inaugural China Coast Marathon in 1981. Organised by the Athletic Veterans of Hong Kong (AVOHK), Hill won in 2-34 which was still the race record at the time of his death 40 years later. When he eventually retired, Hill reckoned he had contested over 2,260 races in his lifetime. Hill was also a successful businessman and founded Ron Hill Sports in 1970 and they were the first company to use synthetic fabrics in sportswear. He also designed mesh running vests with low-cut necklines, and side-split shorts that also allowed air to flow around the body when running. In 1964 Hill set himself a target of running at least one mile every day and he did that consecutively for 52 years and 39 days, or 19,033 days, until illness forced him to discontinue after his final run on 28 January 2017 at the age of 78. The following year Hill was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s. Hill was awarded the MBE in 1971 for his services to athletics. The word “legend” is often used to describe sportsmen or women, but in the case of Ron Hill, it was certainly not overstated.

After completion of her nursing studies she joined the Davos Ski Club where she was trained and could then join the Swiss National Ski Team in 1948 where, as a city girl, she faced harsh competition from the mountain girls. Married with one child at the time, her first major victory was at the Swiss Championships in 1950 held in Crans where she came in first place in the downhill event, having finished in second place in the previous year. Later that same year, she won the downhill event in the Arlberg-Kandahar race, where she also placed second in the combination and fourth in the slalom. She was consistently placed in the top three in the slalom and downhill events in the next two Swiss Championships (1951 and 1952), with another first place finish in the downhill event in 1951 at Adelboden. As one of the top female skiers in Switzerland in the early 1950s, Idly Walpoth earned a place on the Swiss skiing delegation to the 1952 Oslo Olympics. There, she competed in both the downhill and giant slalom events where she placed 12th and 25th respectively. Having usually raced on metallic skis as opposed to the classic wooden skis, unfortunately, prior to her Olympic events, Walpoth’s set of skis were stolen and she was forced to race with lent wooden ones. This was much to her chagrin, though to the liking of the Swiss ski team management, who had previously made the suggestion, which she had refused. After what she saw to be deception at the Olympic games in Oslo, she resigned from the Swiss ski team, but continued skiing until her mid-80’s with her son and four grandchildren.",

In 1958 he repeated his win at the Asian Games in the decathlon, and also won silver medals in the high hurdles and long jump, and a bronze medal in the 400 hurdles. Yang attended UCLA where he competed on the track team alongside his good friend Rafer Johnson. At the 1960 Olympic Games the battle between Yang and Johnson was one of the highlights of the Olympics. Yang was superior in the running and jumping events, but Johnson’s strength in the throwing events gave him a small lead going into the 1,500. Yang was a better 1,500 runner, but Johnson hung on Yang’s tail throughout the race and managed to narrowly win the gold, Yang taking silver. In 1963 Yang set a world indoor record in the pole vault (4.96 m) and also broke the decathlon world record with 9,121 points. He was expected to be favored for the 1964 decathlon gold medal but a change in the scoring tables devalued his superiority in the pole vault and he placed only fifth in Tokyo.

But in August he beat Jesse Owens’ 25-year-old world record with a mark of 26-11¼ (8.21) and went on to take the gold medal. In 1961 he twice improved the record, becoming the first man to jump 27 feet (8.23), but then lost the record to Igor Ter-Ovanesyan of the Soviet Union in 1962. Boston equalled that mark in August 1964, broke it the following month, and in May 1965, set his last world record with 27-5 (8.35). Boston won the AAU outdoor long jump for six successive seasons (1961-1966), the AAU indoor in 1961, and the Pan American Games in 1963 and 1967. Competing for Tennessee State, he won the NCAA outdoor title in 1960. Boston was also a gifted performer in other events. In 1961 he was undefeated in the high hurdles and won the AAU indoor in 1965. He placed fourth in the 1963 Pan American Games high jump, and in that year headed the U.S. lists in the triple jump. Ralph Boston competed for a few more years after the 1968 Olympics.

Four years earlier, Croy was in the GDR team that won the bronze medal at the München Olympics, following a 2-2 draw, after extra-time, against the Soviet Union. During the period of extra-time, neither team tried to win, because they knew a draw would secure both of them a medal. Croy was also in the East German team that surprisingly beat West Germany 1-0 in the 1974 World Cup. Croy played 94 international matches between 1967-76, as well as 23 matches with the GDR Olympic team. As he was a world class goalkeeper, he was therefore allowed to play with one of the non-prominent GDR clubs, BSG Motor Zwickau, later renamed BSG Sachsenring Zwickau. In 1967 and 1975 he helped them to win the East German Cup. He was also named Footballer of the Year in 1972, 1976 and 1978. Croy graduated as a sports teacher and football coach, and coached his home club until 1988. He then became a technical worker at Hochschule Zwickau, and worked as a sports teacher. After reunification, Croy became a representative of the sports goods company Puma, and was also editor of some Saxony newspapers. In addition, he served on the board of Sachsenring Zwickau.

921512,Joseph Webster Golinkin,Male,10 September 1896,,, United States,USA,"Joseph Golinkin studied in Chicago and New York and began his art career as a newspaper illustrator. He was later a brilliant painter of sporting scenes, especially boxing matches, including Joe Louis’ (1914-81) rematch against German boxer Max Schmeling (1905-2005) in 1938, fox hunts, and America’s Cup races. Many of his paintings show aspects of American life in the 1920s and 30s – dancing, jazz concerts and portraits. Golinkin was also a stamp designer. He painted in oil and watercolor and created lithographs and etchings as a graphic artist. During World War II Golinkin was an admiral in the US Navy, serving as commander of the destroyer USS Hilbert in 1944. The 1932 work Leg Scissors won the gold medal in Mixed Graphic Arts within the Art Competitions. It was released on 3 August 1932 in the Los Angeles Times under the title “Games Foster Competition in Genius”. The lithograph not only appeared under the title Leg Scissors but also as Head Scissors. Manassa Mauler is a nickname of boxer Jack Dempsey (1895-1983), given to him after his birthplace Manassa in Colorado. The lithograph from 1925 was sized 35.5 x 45.7 cm. In that year, however, Dempsey did not have a fight and his career was already coming to an end. No illustration of Break it off could be found. The work was mentioned referring to an exhibition under the title Break it off and Throw it up Here, however, and described as a picture of an enthusiastic crowd. Reverse Headlock from about 1931 was also a lithograph. The sheet measured 55.5 x 40.2 cm, and the print 33.8 x 27.4 cm. Tear ˈim Apart, another lithograph 41.2 x 31.5 cm in size, is said to have been produced as late as 1938, but this is obviously wrong. Under the title Polo at Meadow Brook-No. 1-6, a series of watercolors was submitted depicting scenes from an international tournament held in 1930 on the grounds of the Meadowbrook Polo Club (formerly just the Meadow Brook Club), probably the annual United States National Open held there. The club was then located in Westbury, now Old Westbury, New York, and is the oldest, continuously active polo club in the USA, founded in 1881. It is unknown how many paintings were produced on this occasion. It is also impossible to identify the works exhibited in 1932. The formats of most of the paintings range from just under 30 to about 40 cm in side length, although some reached twice that size. In 1936 Golinkin participated with two lithographs in the Berlin Art Competitions: Primo on the Ropes from 1935 (43 x 53 cm) and Baer – Louis from 1936 (40.2 x 50.3 cm). The former shows a scene from Primo Carnera’s (1906-67) fight against Max Baer (1909-59) on 14 June 1934 at the Madison Square Garden Bowl in Long Island City. Baer, the challenger, knocked down Carnera 10 times and finally stopped him in the 11th round to gain the title. The fight of Joe Louis against Max Baer took place on 24 September 1935 at Yankee Stadium in New York. In the third round Louis knocked down Baer twice, the first time that Baer was ever knocked down in his career. A left hook in the fourth round dropped him to his knees again, and the referee stopped the fight shortly thereafter. There are several very similar versions of this lithograph.",

900800,Leonhard Seppala,Male,14 September 1877,,, United States,USA,"Leonhard Seppala was born in Norway but emigrated to Alaska during the 1900 Nome gold rush. In 1913 he inherited a team of Chukchi Huskies, which were later called Siberian Huskies. The dogs had been scheduled to accompany Roald Amundsen to the North Pole, but with the hostilities of World War I, the expedition was cancelled, and the dogs were given to Seppala. Seppala began sled dog racing with them, and became a top musher, winning the All-Alaska Sweepstakes in 1915-17. He continued to win sled dog races through the 1920s and 30s. In January 1925, an outbreak of diphtheria occurred in Nome, but brutal winter temperatures, down to −50 °F (−45.6 °C) with 80 mph (130 km/h) winds, made it impossible for traditional methods to deliver medicine to Nome. Instead, the serum was carried by rail from Anchorage to Nenana and relays of dog teams were sent the remainder of the way—674 miles (1,085 km). Seppala’s Siberian Husky dog team traveled 340 miles (550 km) out from Nome and back through the most treacherous sections of Alaska’s wilderness, including across the perilous ice of Norton Sound, and carried the serum over 91 miles (146 km) of the route, led by his lead dog, Togo. The event is known as the Great Serum Run, and was the inspiration for the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog race. Seppala and his dogs became famous for this and he toured the lower 48 demonstrating his dogs. In January 1927 he raced in Maine against Arthur Walden, founder of the New England Sled Dog Club, who was led by his top dog, Chinook, a Malamute. Seppala won the race easily, and started the New England interest in sled dog racing. Walden also started breeding Huskies at his kennel in Poland Spring, Maine. Seppala is considered the father of the Siberian Husky breed, which was recognized by the American Kennel Club (AKC) in 1930. In Nome, a street is named after him, Seppala Drive, which connects the town to the airport. Seppala worked for a mining company in Alaska, until he and his wife moved near Seattle, Washington, where he lived until his death.",

From his orphanage he was given the surname Genito, which later changed into Gemito. Two weeks later he was adopted by a young family who has recently lost a child. Gemito apprenticed as a youth in the studios of Emanuele Caggiano and Stanislao Lista. Also taught by his adoptive father in his early years, he went to Paris in 1877 where he was influenced by Jean-Louis Ernest Meissonier, but he returned to Naples after his death. Through his unconventional work, Gemito made a name for himself in his youth. His preparatory sketches are also considered independent works of art. Later he mainly worked with terracotta and bronze. After a mental breakdown, interspersed with periods in a mental hospital, he worked on drawings for almost 20 years before returning to sculpturing in 1909. His later works were silver- and goldsmiths. The works date from decades before the 1924 Olympic Games: there are two bronzes with the title La Sorgente (The Source from 1909/1912 and 1924, respectively). The latter version is 56 cm high. Nettuno Giovinetto (Neptune’s Youth is a 34 cm high bronze figure from 1910. The Water seller is usually referred to as Acquaiolo (Water carrier). The bronze statuette from 1881 is 54 cm high. Copies include those at the Musée d’Orsay and the Michelangelo Museum in Tuscany. Gemito created several heads of boys. The Busto di fanciullo (Bust of a boy), created around 1919, is a 35 cm tall - sometimes gilded - bronze bust. Several versions of Medallions of Alexander the Great were made from different materials. It is not known which of these were exhibited in 1924.",

As early as the 1920s he published two books on urban planning. From 1920-22 and 1922-41, he served as an architectural officer at the Osaka and Tokyo Municipal Offices, respectively, where he was in charge of the design and construction of municipal buildings. He was also involved in planning facilities for the scheduled 1940 Tokyo Olympics. At this time, he spent a fortune collecting foreign books on housing and urban planning and published several books on urban planning and urban design in the 1920s, some on foreign urban planning. In 1941 Ishihara was named to a new scholarly post in the research division of the Juhtaku Eidan (Japan Housing Authority) and for a very short period, from 1944-45, was installed as a professor of architecture in the Military College of Technology in Bandung on the occupied Indonesian island of Java. After Japan’s defeat he lived for one year on a sparsely inhabited island. After World War II Ishihara became a professor at the Architectural Department of Tokyo Metropolitan University in 1949, and was one of the pioneering professors of urban planning in Japan until the 1960s. Ishihara was a well-known figure in the urban planning academic community in Japan and held the position of the president of the City Planning Institute of Japan from 1961-63. His main scientific interest, however, focused on farmers’ traditional houses, writing a series of 16 volumes called Farm Houses in Japan during the period 1934-1943. In 1950, he founded a group that has developed into the Japan Association of Folk House. From the late 1920s to his death, Ishihara was also a devoted Christian and Pacifist. Before World War II, he was involved in socialist activities with young architects and architectural students. In 1930, he was an active member of the most radical of these groups, named Rising League of Architects. The group disbanded after only a few months under major pressure by the police. During his later years he published a newsletter Peace and Gospel. He also provided services to the poor in a housing settlement, which was founded and developed, along with several of his students, in a former slum area in Tokyo.

During World War I he regularly wrote letters from the Western front to Theodor Wolff, the chief editor of the liberal Berliner Tageblatt. Wolff made a war diary from the letters and put Zeiz’ impressions directly in his paper. His impressions portrayed the hard-hitting everyday life of front soldiers, including the message to promote humanity instead of the language of war guns. In the 1930s, Zeiz published poems and novels and wrote comedies under the pseudonym Georg Fraser, while from 1941-45 he worked under the pseudonym Jean Barlatier. In 1934, he emigrated to Austria. As the husband of a Jewess Zeiz was protected until 1943 by the Nazi cultural functionary Hans Hinkel, a German journalist and ministerial official in the Third Reich. Nevertheless, as the head of an Austrian publisher in 1938-39, Zeiz was eventually arrested. When released he led a double life as a playwright and helped Jews with shelter and to escape the Nazis. In early 1943, Zeiz was discovered and transferred to the Dachau concentration camp, while his wife was murdered at the same time at concentration camp Auschwitz. After World War II, his character broken, he had little success, his resistance work remained largely unnoticed, and he suffered from depression and memory loss. At the end of the 1950s he withdrew from active life and died, totally forgotten, in Berlin in 1964. Only in 1977 was Zeiz’s memory rehabilitated by Austrian authorities.",

One of his first coaches was Béla Varga, from whom he also got the name Virág. He primarily competed in freestyle in the half-heavyweight category, but in 1935 he was able to win national championships in both categories. At the international level, in Stockholm in 1934, he took second place in the European Championship in freestyle, and a year later he won the European Championship in Bruxelles. After that he went to the Berlin Olympics with high hopes, where he was unfortunately unlucky with the draw. In the first round he still won against Lahti from Finland, but in the next two rounds, he had to wrestle first against Sweden’s Fridell, who later won the gold medal, and then against Estonian Neo, the silver medalist, and he was defeated and eliminated. Even before the Olympics he was lured into the world of professionals several times, so it is no wonder that after his disappointing Olympic appearance, he turned professional that year. He first wrestled in Europe, then in 1937 he moved to America, which offered greater opportunities where he continued his professional wrestling career. He fought his first overseas professional match, now under the name Ed Don Virag, in 1937 and during his stay there he won the Midwest Championship several times, which was one of the most important professional titles in US at the time. In 1939 he unexpectedly appeared in Europe as he was asked to coach the Italian Olympic wrestling team. He continued his wrestling career after the war ended. He also took part in a European tour in 1951 during which he died in a car accident in Greece in October at the age of just 39.",Listed in Olympians Who Died in Motor Vehicle Accidents (Boat/Car/Motorcycle/Train) (Died in a car accident.)

Notably, he appeared in the classic movie Citizen Kane (1941) as an uncredited cast member in Xanadu Great Hall.

96310,Cliff Pennington,Male,18 April 1940,183.0,77, Canada,CAN,"Winnipeg native Clifford “Cliff” Pennington began his career as an ice hockey forward in the Manitoba Junior Hockey League in 1955, playing two seasons with the St. Boniface Canadiens and winning the league’s championship Turnbull Cup in 1956. He then joined the Flin Flon Bombers of the Saskatchewan Junior Hockey League in 1957 where he stayed, at least nominally, until 1960. He had intermittent runs with the Winnipeg Warriors of the Western Hockey League during this period, but his break came in 1959 when he signed with the Kitchener-Waterloo Dutchmen of the Senior Ontario Hockey League, despite also being on the roster for the Bombers. Although he spent most of the season with the Dutchmen, he also did plenty of travelling. Most notably, he accompanied them to the 1960 Winter Olympics as they represented Canada in ice hockey and took home a silver medal. At the tournament he played in four matches, but did not score any goals. Back in Canada he suited up for two more matches with the Warriors and played for the Bombers and the Edmonton Oil Kings in the playoffs for the Memorial Cup, Canada’s annually trophy for the junior men’s ice hockey champions. Pennington turned professional in 1960, playing at first for the Hull-Ottawa Canadiens of the Eastern Professional Hockey League, with whom he won the league championship, MVP award (shared with Fred Burchell), and Rookie of the Year honor. He also signed a contract to join the Montreal Canadiens of the National Hockey League. He played in only four matches, scoring one goal, with Montreal prior to being traded to the Boston Bruins in June 1961. The 1961-1962 season was his only full one in the NHL and he split the following year between the Bruins and the Kingston Frontenacs of the EPHL (and winning his second league championship). In June 1963 he was traded to the San Francisco Seals of the World Hockey League but, after 26 games, he was traded back to Boston in December and ended up spending the remainder of the season with the Quebec Aces of the American Hockey League. His career became only less stable after that; from 1964 until his 1974 retirement from active play he suited up with the Verdun Pirates of the Quebec Senior Hockey League (1964-1965), the Los Angeles Blades of the WHL (1965-1966), the Florida Rockets (1966-1967), Nashville Dixie Flyers (1967-1969), Jacksonville Rockets (1971-1972), and St. Petersburg/Suncoat Suns (1971-1974) of the Eastern Hockey League and the Des Moines Oak Leafs (1969-1971) and Flint Generals (1970-1971) of the International Hockey League.

6970,Oscar Robertson,Male,24 November 1938,196.0,90, United States,USA,"Until the advent of Michael Jordan, many people feel Oscar Robertson, “The Big O”, was the greatest guard to ever play basketball. A few went even further and called him the greatest basketball player period. Robertson started his road to stardom at Crispus Attucks High School in Indianapolis and then took his show to the University of Cincinnati. For three consecutive years he led the NCAA in scoring, made first-team All-America, and was named collegiate Player of the Year. In his junior year, he broke the NCAA career scoring mark which had been set in a four-year career. Robertson was 6-5 (1.95) tall and was a natural guard, though he was probably the biggest man to ever play that position at the time. In 1959 he was on the gold medal winning team at the Pan American Games. At Rome in 1960 he often played forward because of his size and jumping ability. After the Olympics, Robertson joined the Cincinnati Royals with whom he stayed until 1970 when he was traded to the Milwaukee Bucks. It was while playing with the Bucks in 1971 that he finally played on an NBA champion. In his 14-year pro career, Robertson re-wrote the record book. He was 10 times named to first team All-NBA and twice, in the twilight of his career, was named to the second team. He was Rookie of the Year in 1961 and MVP in 1964 – rare feats back then for a guard.

Winans eventually settled in England and showed immense talent in many fields. Apart from his Olympic rifle successes, he was a noted pistol shot and a renowned equestrian sculptor, exhibiting 14 times at the British Royal Academy. In this field he won a second Olympic gold medal in the Arts Competition at Stockholm in 1912 for his statuette An American Trotter – the only American to win medals both in the art and sport phases of Olympic competition. The sculpture was donated to the Swedish Olympic Committee for a new sports museum after the 1912 Olympic Games. At the 1908 Olympics, there was a question raised about Winans’ eligibility because he had never set foot in America and he was required to swear his allegiance to the U.S. Consul General in order to participate in the Olympics. Winans did eventually visit the US but not until he was 58 years of age. Trotting, another of his interests, led to his death. While driving in a race in England, he suffered a heart attack, fell, and broke his skull, dying instantly.

DeMont won the race, and looked to be the gold medalist. Two days later, DeMont swam his preliminary round heat in the 1,500 freestyle and qualified for the final of that event. It was then announced that he had tested positive for a banned substance and was disqualified from the 400 freestyle and the 1,500 metres. Unlike many athletes who test positive, DeMont did not deny that he had taken Marax the night before his 400 metre races, but the reason was that he was an asthmatic and regularly took Marax, an ephedrine derivative, to help control wheezing. When he had an attack in the Olympic Village he took a pill between 0100 and 0200 and took another pill the next morning. DeMont never hid the fact that he took the drug on a regular basis for his asthma, and had noted this on his medical form required of US athletes, but the United States’ team doctors had never checked to see if it contained any banned substances. Despite protests by United States officials, Rick DeMont was disqualified and Brad Cooper declared the winner of the 400 freestyle. In 1996 DeMont sued the United States Olympic Committee (USOC) for having mishandled his situation in München. Among other things, it was alleged that the IOC offered to exonerate DeMont and let him keep the gold medal if the USOC would have the US team doctors accept responsibility for the error, but the USOC refused. In 2001 the USOC finally accepted responsibility and asked the IOC to restore DeMont’s gold medal but the IOC would not do so. In 1973 Rick DeMont went to Belgrade, Yugoslavia for the 1st World Aquatics Championships. In the final of the 400 metre freestyle, he defeated Cooper, breaking the world record and becoming the first swimmer to better four minutes for the 400 free, recording 3:58.18. He also won silver there in the 1,500 freestyle. DeMont attended college at the University of Washington (1973-75) and the University of Arizona (1977-79). He later became a swim coach at the University of Arizona and an accomplished artist. DeMont is a member of the International Swimming Hall of Fame, the University of Arizona Athletic Hall of Fame, and the Bay Area Sports Hall of Fame.","Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the Summer Pan American Games (1–1–0 1975 Ciudad de México SWI gold: 4×200 m freestyle relay, silver: 200 m freestyle) Listed in Olympians Who Set a World Record in Long Course Swimming (400 m freestyle – 9 September 1973 - 22 August 1974: 3:58.18 (9 September 1973; Beograd, YUG); 1500 m freestyle – 6 August 1972 - 4 September 1972: 15:52.91 (6 August 1972; Chicago, USA); 4×100 m freestyle relay – 28 August 1977 - 22 August 1978: 3:21.11 (28 August 1977; Ost-Berlin, GDR)) Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the World Aquatics Championships (1–1–0 1973 Belgrade SWI gold: 400 m freestyle, silver: 1500 m freestyle) Listed in Doping Irregularities at the Olympics (1972 München – 400 metre Freestyle (1).

Because the times for both the 220 y flat race and hurdles bettered the existing records for the marginally shorter 200 m distances, Owens was also credited with the metric world records. Owens’ second great triumph came at the Berlin Olympics the following year, when he won four gold medals and set a world record of 20.7 for 200 m around a turn and contributed to a second world record in the 4×100 m relay. At Berlin he was the leader of what the Germans termed “America’s Black Auxiliaries” and his dominance made a mockery of Hitler’s theories of Aryan supremacy. Jesse Owens was the second youngest of the 11 children of an impoverished Alabama sharecropper; when he was nine, the family moved to Cleveland. Owens first showed his outstanding sporting talent at East Tech High School in Cleveland and then attended The Ohio State University. In addition to his above triumphs, he won several AAU and NCAA championships while a student at Ohio State. Shortly after the Berlin Olympics, Owens turned professional at the age of 23 and experienced many years of financial hardship and racial discrimination. Eventually his public relations firm prospered and his last years were spent as a successful businessman. He became a member of the USOC, was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1976, and was a dedicated and much sought-after speaker for the causes of Olympism and racial harmony. With Joe Louis, Jesse Owens was one of the first athletes in the United States to see his popularity cross racial lines.

But Storholt was determined to get back, and by 1972 he had returned to the Norwegian top. When most of the top Norwegian skaters turned professional in 1973, he was suddenly one of the best amateur speed skaters in Norway. But it wasn’t until Johs Tenmann started coaching the Norwegian skaters that Storholt achieved international success. In 1976, Storholt won Olympic gold in the 1,500 m, beating Yury Kondakov narrowly, to become the third member of his Trondheim club Falken to win that title after Hjalmar Andersen and Sverre Farstad.

920737,Ernst Udet,Male,26 April 1896,,, Germany,GER,"After Manfred von Richthofen, the second greatest German war pilot ace in World War I was Ernst Udet, surviving the war with 62 victories. He was a very early aviator, as he was taught to fly before joining the army by an understanding and rich father. Udet was a good but reckless pilot, and often brought his machine home in very extreme situations. After his plane crashed frequently, he was given a penalty, seven days in prison. In August 1917, Udet took over the command of Jasta 37. In April 1918, he was hospitalized because he developed ear problems. After his recovery he came back to his fighter squadron just as Richthofen was shot down. The next day Udet was also shot down when he tried to return to his lines. A few days later, Germany was on the ground and the war ended. After the war Udet became a test pilot, stunt pilot, racer, entrepreneur and actor. In the 1920s he was increasingly successful in various air events at home and abroad. At one of these events he flew a monoplane under the Isar Bridge in München, and did a loop with the engine off, exploiting the speed obtained by the ball swoop. Udet was a rare combination of a superb flier with natural talent and a superb tactician, which surely helped him survive World War I. During World War II Udet was installed by Hermann Göring as the General Aircraft Master and Chief of Technical Offices of the German Air Force. During this time he was responsible for the introduction and development of the crash warplane Junkers Ju 87 (abbreviation “Stuka” – which also used a siren invented by Udet). However, his armored concept for the use of hunters, hunter dive bombers (Stuka), and light bombers was only successful in the early phase of World War II. For his failure at the Battle of Britain, for which he was blamed by Adolf Hitler and Hermann Göring, Udet chose to commit suicide in November 1941 by shooting himself into his head. Udet was never a major military manager, as he was often portrayed. As a dramatic and literary figure German emigrant Carl Zuckmayer wrote his biography in 1946, The Devil’s General, not least because of the circumstances of his death. His suicide was concealed by the Nazi regime to the people, and instead, he received a state funeral. The official version of the Nazi regime was “Generalluftzeugmeister General Udet suffered such a severe accident on Monday, 17 November 1941, when testing a new weapon, that he died from injuries on the scene …” The death of the author of Mein Fliegerleben (My flying life) (Udet‘s entry to the 1936 Berlin Art Competitions in the category Literature), did not help the book’s popularity. His autobiography was published in 1935 and describes in a glorifying manner Udet’s experiences as a pilot in World War I and later in air displays and making movies on several continents, illustrated by numerous photographs.","Listed in Olympians Who Committed Suicide (Committed suicide, shot himself after years of alcoholism and drugs.)"

Therefore, these issues were the main subjects of his sketches and he was a so-called “cowboy artist.” At the beginning of the 20th century the big ranches began to disappear and Borein gave up the life of a wandering cowboy and turned to illustrating newspapers and magazines. After initially running a studio in Oakland, he moved to New York in 1907 and worked on etchings. In 1921 he returned to California and ran a successful studio until his death in 1945. The Long Throw, produced around 1915, may be one of Borein’s earliest drypoint etchings (print 14 x 26, sheet 25 x 36 cm). This title appeared also as a subtitle of End of the Race, an etching (18 x 28 cm) like all submitted works. In After the Buffalo Hunt (20.3 x 30.5 cm, Navajos (22.9 x 30.5 cm) and Charging Hawk (11.1 x 13.7 cm) the Native Americans were in the focus.

In 1923 he became a professor of murals in Kraków and later in Warszawa. He was best known in Poland for his monumental wall and ceiling paintings, especially of group portraits. After the establishment of the Polish People’s Republic, Kowarski gave expression to humanistic and heroic revolutionary ideals in several series of paintings related to Socialist realism.

Shortly after Jandera was fighting on the battlefield during World War I where he suffered a shrapnel injury in his leg from a grenade. Rather than that being the end of his sporting career he took up yoga to make a full recovery, returning to the athletics track. During the 1920s and the early 1930s Jandera became a 12-time champion of Czechoslovakia in the 110 metres hurdles and a four-time national champion in the triple jump. Jandera ran in the 110 metres hurdles at the 1924 Paris Olympics where he reached the semi-finals. He was also scheduled to run in the 4 × 100 metres relay in Paris but the Czechoslovak quartet did not start the race. Four years later he ran in the hurdles at the 1928 Amsterdam Olympics where he once again reached the semi-finals. Following the German occupation during World War II Jandera joined the Czech resistance organisation Defence of the Nation (“Obrana národa”) but was arrested in 1942 and sentenced to four years in prison. In February 1945, with the Germans retreating from the British, Jandera was forced on a death march and was one of only a handful of prisoners to survive the ordeal. Following the war he was a member of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia where he worked in the physical education arm of the Ministry of Education. After a trip to the Soviet Union Jandera founded his own sports school for young athletes in 1952. There was a conflicting account around Jandera’s death, which involved him dying after he fell off his bicycle. This proved to be false as he was involved in an accident when a tram hit him as he crossed a road in Letná, Praha. Despite ending up in hospital nothing serious had happened to him. The day before Jandera was scheduled to be discharged, however, he developed a blood clot, which caused a fatal heart attack.

His best performance in the singles was in 1910 when he reached the semi-final before losing in four sets to the American Beals Wright. Lowe twice reached the All-comers’ doubles final with his brother, losing to the Australasian pair Norman Brookes and Anthony Wilding, the eventual champions, in 1914 and in 1921, again with brother Gordon, when they lost to the British pair Randolph Lycett and Max Woosnam, who also went on to win the title. Lowe reached the final of the British Covered Court championship at Queen’s Club in 1910 but lost to his brother in the final. He then enjoyed the most successful spell of his career in 1911-12, winning tournaments at Edgbaston, Tunbridge Wells, Eastbourne and Scarborough. He also made his Davis Cup début in 1911 and in 1912 represented Great Britain at the Olympic Games, taking part in the indoor singles and doubles (again with his brother), but he finished equal fifth in each competition.

She had been skating since the age of three and taken a gold medal in the 3,000m relay alongside teammates Angela Cutrone, Danielle Gervais, and Cathy Morin at the 1987 Canada Winter Games. She had also participated in the sport at the 1988 Winter Olympics, when it was a demonstration tournament, but her major international successes had come only a year prior to the Olympics, when she took gold medals in the team event and the 3,000m relay at the 1991 World Championships. She stepped further into the spotlight at the 1992 Winter Olympics, where she won a gold medal with her team in the 3,000m relay. She planned to attend the 1994 Winter Olympics, but she experienced a violent crash prior to the games that left her with a concussion and the need for many surgeries. Determined to attend the 1998 Winter Olympics, Perreault quit her job as an accountant and began training full time. Along the way she won two bronze medals at the 1995 World Championships, a silver medal at the 1996 World Championships, and silver and gold at the 1997 World Championships. None of this, however, prepared her for the acclaim that she would receive at the 1998 Winter Olympics when she won a gold medal in the 500m event, Canada’s first Olympic individual short track speed skating gold. She also took home a bronze medal in the 3,000m relay and silver and bronze at the year’s World Championships. She continued to train for the 2002 Winter Olympics and won a silver medal in at the 1999 World Championships and two bronze medals at the 2000 World Championships.

She was an alternate at the 2002 Olympics Games on the 3,000m relay team, but did not actually compete in the event.

He studied at the Rijksakademie and then trained under George Hendrik Breitner (1857-1923), who was an important Impressionist and photographer at that time. From 1901-05 he lived in Paris, Madrid, and Roma. Maks was known for his paintings of fashionable night life, especially in Paris, using new motifs such as circus acts, dancing couples and garden parties, previously unknown in Dutch art. His buoyant subjects and frivolous way of painting, in simplified, yet bright, strong colors, impressed the public. According to a contemporary description, his painting submitted in 1928 and titled Passage shows a circus motif in strong color tones. Therefore, it could well be Mevrouw Renz op haar Engelsche volbloed (Mrs. Renz on her English thoroughbred), an oil painting on canvas in the format 51.2 x 68.3 cm. A similar painting in a larger format is in the Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam. However, a large number of paintings by his hand depicts circus riders, showing the “High School”. Only one painting has the name of Ernst Schumann in the title: De heer Ernst Schuman in de Hooge School (oil on canvas, 99 x 94 cm) can be assumed to be his 1928 entry.

Although Doris enjoyed archery successes, mostly in Wales, the south-\west of England, and at club meetings at the Hereford Bowmen and Stretton Archers, she never enjoyed the same success at major events. Like many women archers of the day, they all had to contend with Alice Legh, the dominant female archer at that time. However, Day collected minor prizes at the Grand National meeting, including a prize for the best score at 50 yards in 1925, when she was more than 50-years-of-age. Day and her husband emigrated to South Africa in between the two World Wars. Her father, George Henry Philips was a Justice of the Peace and a Deputy-Lieutenant for the County of Radnorshire.",

Von König first studied sculpture in Hamburg, then drawing and painting in Berlin at the Art Academy, and later at the Académie Julian in Paris from 1894-97. For the next two years, he lived in various places in Germany and travelled extensively to Russia, London, and Brittany.

His daughter Esther (1923-2014) was a student of Gerhard Marcks and became an expert on Egyptian art. In 1936, von König could only participate “out of competition”, because, at the same time, he was a member of the jury for painting. His mother was born Freiin von Cramm, a great aunt of the famous tennis player Gottfried von Cramm, 1935-37 three times Wimbledon finalist. The oil painting with his portrait was to be exhibited in 1937 in the Great German Art Exhibition in the House of German Art in München. However, it was one of the paintings that Hitler sorted out during a tour before the opening. The painting was temporarily exhibited in the Alte Pinakothek in München and was returned to the family by order of the Nazi leadership after von Cramm’s release from prison in 1938, He had been sentenced to one year in prison for homosexual acts but was released early.",Listed in Olympian Members of the Nobility (Freiherr (Baron))

He was an Olympic Torch Relay runner for the 2008 Olympic Games in China, carrying the Olympic Flame into Tiananmen Square in Beijing. Ming played five seasons in the Chinese Basketball Association (CBA) with the Shanghai Starks before moving to the National Basketball Association (NBA) in the United States. He was the number one overall draft pick, taken by the Houston Rockets in the 2002 NBA Draft. Ming earned all-star honours in his first seven seasons, helping the Rockets to playoff appearances in five of those years. He played his entire NBA career in Houston, but due to constant injuries, retired in 2011. Due to his international star status, the exceptionally tall Ming (even by NBA standards) stood 2.26m (7 feet 5 inches), and became the focus of the NBA’s efforts to popularize the league around the globe. The NBA began producing All-Star ballots in three languages (English, Spanish, Chinese) for fan voting of the starters for the 2003 NBA All-Star Game. Ming received nearly a quarter-million more votes than American superstar Shaquille O’Neal, and he became the first rookie to start in the All-Star Game since Grant Hill in 1995.

He even bought his former club team (Shanghai Sharks) when financial troubles threatened their stability. He is a supporter of the Special Olympics where he served as a Global Ambassador and was a member of the International Board of Directors. Ming has partnered with the African Wildlife Foundation and WildAid as an ambassador for their “Say No” campaign dedicated to elephant and rhinoceros conservation and filmed a documentary, along with numerous public service announcements.

902737,Oskar Morawetz,Male,17 January 1917,,, Canada,CAN,"Czechoslovakiam-born Oskar Morawetz was a Canadian composer, pianist and music teacher, who studied in Praha and Wien (Vienna). At an early age, he developed an ability to sight-read orchestral scores at the piano, and at age 19 he was recommended by George Szell for the assistant conductor’s post with the Praha Opera. After the Nazi invasion of the Sudetenland in 1938, Morawetz applied for a Canadian visa, which was granted after several refusals. After brief periods of residence in Wien and Paris, he left just ahead of Nazi invading forces, fleeing Europe and arriving in Toronto in June 1940. Morawetz taught music theory and composition in 1946-52 at the Royal Conservatory of Music, and from 1952 until his retirement in 1982 at the University of Toronto. Morawetz performed on the piano frequently after his arrival in Canada, but the number of his performances diminished as his composition career grew. His œuvre extended over a wide range including 120 compositions, although the core of his work was his orchestral compositions. The only major form he did not undertake during his career was opera. Morawetz was one of the most popular Canadian composers and was awarded the “Order of Ontario” and the “Order of Canada” in 1987 and 1989, respectively. In 1948, he submitted one work in the Olympic art competitions in the orchestra category. In many (Olympic) sources listed as Festival Overture it is most probably Morawetz’ Carnival Overture. The almost 6-minute long piece, his opus 2, was composed in 1946 (revised in 1970).",

He also regularly competed in the South of the Thames Championship. He finished second to Jack Webster in the AAAs steeplechase in 1927 and again in 1928, when he also finished second in the one mile steeplechase at the British Games at Stamford Bridge. As the reigning Southern Champion he eventually won the AAAs title in 1929 when the defending champion Webster was disqualified after an infringement at the water jump on the second lap. He was forced to take evasive action to avoid spiking the man in front of him and his failure to clear the jump resulted in a disqualification which allowed Oliver to race away and take the title, but well outside Webster’s record time. It is debatable if Webster would have won anyway as he had engaged in a gruelling four mile race shortly before the steeplechase.

His opponent, Johnny Condon of Lynn AC, qualified for the final with a KO against the only foreign entrant in the division, Pierre Mazior of France, and then survived a hard semi-final against Wally Webb of St. Pancras BC. The rules of the 1908 Games provided that any boxer drawing a bye shall be bound to spar for the specified time with any opponent approved by the judges and referee. There is no evidence as to whether this condition was imposed on Thomas but he certainly entered the ring as the fresher of the two finalists. Condon, who was not noted for his aggression, surprisingly carried the fight to his opponent but after a grueling contest it was Thomas who got the verdict. Although Great Britain won all five boxing gold medals at the 1908 Games, Thomas was the only reigning ABA champion to succeed in winning an Olympic title. Harry Thomas turned professional in 1909 and, although he never fought for the British title, he produced some impressive performances and when he went to settle in America early in 1911 he took with him an unbeaten record. Apart from 1913, when he fought seven times in Australia, all his remaining fights were in the USA. Thomas retired from boxing in 1916 and became an American citizen. Following America’s entry into the war in 1917 he served in the US Navy. He had six brothers, all of who also served in the war with the British forces, his eldest brother, Bill, winning the DCM.

As a 20-year-old in 1915 he joined the Royal Navy and served in World War I. After the war he joined the Glasgow Police where he served as a sergeant. MacDonald was known throughout the city as Bonnie Archie but, despite his seemingly friendly nickname, he was a magnificent figure of a man and was feared by the criminals of the City. After he was recruited in 1931 for a crack new team of Untouchables formed by the new Chief Constable Sir Percy Sillitoe, he and his colleagues became the scourge of the Glasgow underworld. It was during his time in the force that Archie would have spent time in one of the Glasgow police gymnasia to develop his freestyle wrestling skills in what was then called ‘catch-as-catch-can’ wrestling. After the Great War he quickly became Scottish champion and was selected to compete in the 1920 Olympic Games in Antwerp but lost his only bout to the much heavier Swede Ernst Nilsson. In Paris four years later Archie won the bronze medal without winning a single bout. He was defeated twice and then a series of walkovers led to him being placed third and in that medal-winning position. Archie turned to boxing and in 1928 was the Scottish police heavyweight champion. He retired from the police shortly before the Second World War and took up the post as the Customs Officer at Kyle of Lochalsh on the north-west coast of Scotland. He retired in 1960 and returned to his family home at Sleat on the Island of Skye.",

13434,Lance Armstrong,Male,18 September 1971,178.0,75, United States,USA,"Lance Armstrong has known the highest highs and the lowest lows that an athlete can experience. Armstrong was raised by a single mother after his father left them when he was a small child. He started out in sports as a swimmer, and then became a top junior triathlete in the US, but turned to cycling exclusively because triathlon was not an Olympic sport in the 1980s. Armstrong made the 1992 US Olympic team, and was considered one of the favorites in the road race, but missed a late break, and finished only 14th. Shortly after Barcelona, Armstrong turned professional. He had some success early on, winning the 1993 World Championship road race, but was not a factor for general classification in the grand tours because of his lack of climbing ability, partly because he was heavier than most top climbers. From 1993-96 he raced the Tour de France four times, winning two stages, but finishing the race only once, that in 1995 when he placed 36th. After the 1996 season, where he had not raced well at the Olympics or the Tour, he sought treatment for a medical condition, which turned out to be testicular cancer. Armstrong’s testicular cancer was very advanced when it was found, and had spread widely throughout his body. He underwent chemotherapy, as well as brain surgery to decompress several metastatic lesions. His survival was in doubt, and he was given no chance to return to the professional peloton. But he returned to racing in the 1998 season, initially with very poor results, and he considered quitting the sport. However, he was encouraged by a late-season fourth-place finish at the Vuelta à España. He increased his training after that race, and focused his efforts on the Tour. But when he entered the 1999 Tour de France for the US Postal team, he was not favored, although he had won the Dauphiné-Libéré earlier in the year. At the Tour he took the lead after the stage eight time trial, however, the next day was a mountain stage to Sestrières, and it was thought he would wear the yellow jersey for but a single day. But the near the top of climb, Armstrong was with the leaders Alex Zülle and Richard Virenque, when he stood on his pedals and dropped them dramatically on the way to the summit. He kept the yellow jersey and would wear it all the way to Paris for his seeming first victory in the Tour de France. Over the next few years Armstrong became stronger and stronger and, continuing to focus mostly on the Tour, initially winning the race for seven consecutive years, though the victories would later be declared void. After the 2005 Tour, Armstrong retired, running twice in the New York City Marathon, and also ran the 2008 Boston Marathon. But he came back to competitive cycling in 2009 and rode the Tour again in 2009-10, placing third in 2009, but was back in the pack in 2010. He then announced another retirement from cycling. After his cancer diagnosis, Armstrong started the Livestrong Foundation, which devotes its efforts to fund-raising for cancer research. He worked tirelessly on behalf of the foundation, and in the fight against cancer. His career was not without controversy, however, as he was accused numerous times of using drugs, including by several former teammates, but he never tested positive for a proscribed substance. His major one-day wins, prior to his doping revelations, included the 1993 World Championship road race and the 1996 Flèche Wallone. In shorter stage races, Armstrong also won the 2001 Tour de Suisse, the 2004 Tour of Georgia, Dauphiné Libéré in 1999 and 2002-03, and the Midi-Libre in 2002. In 2013 Armstrong admitted that he had systematically doped throughout his professional career, after revelations by several of his former teammates. He was sanctioned by the US Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) and his Tour victories were removed, along with his Olympic results in 1996 and 2000, and his other titles. His admissions were done on national television in the United States and he went from one of the nation’s top sporting heroes to a reviled, ridiculed, and embarrassed ex-athlete. It was revealed, and he admitted, that he had not only systematically doped, but lied about it frequently, and in addition, berated, bullied, and belittled his accusers, also suing several of them in court. He won most of those suits at first, but several of the defendants later returned counter-suits, seeking to redeem their damages, and inflict further financial penalties on Armstrong.","Listed in Doping Irregularities at the Olympics (2000 Sydney – ITT (3) Retroactively stripped of all his results from 1998 to 2005 for a multitude of violations.

Following racial riots in Harlem, it was decided to build suitable and affordable housing for the city’s African- Americans. The Harlem River Houses represent the first example of federally subsidized public housing and have since become a landmark. In 1903 he married his first wife Helen and had five children. The family moved to a river house in Southampton. Tragically his wife died in 1932 and he re-married in 1934 to Eleanor McMillen, founder of major interior design company.

Although he took violin and theory lessons while he was still at school, he began to study natural science in Lausanne. In 1887, he decided to pursue a musical career, while studying in Berlin and Paris. His main teachers were French composer Jules Massenet and Belgian violinist Martin Marsick. In addition to Massenet, he was particularly influenced by French composers Camille Saint-Saëns and César Franck. From 1893-95 he was the second maestro at the Concerts d’Harcourt, while in 1907 he conducted the orchestra of the Opéra Comique at Paris. Later he held courses at the conservatory in Genève and acted as musical correspondent in Paris for the German newspaper “Berliner Tagblatt”. In 1905 and 1927, Doret wrote the music for the Fête des Vignerons. His 1990 catalogue lists more than 400 compositions including cantatas, oratorios, stage and chamber music. He was appointed Officer of the Legion of Honor. Like his teacher Jules Massenet Doret was a traditional composer and despised the new trends in music in the early 20th century. Like the French composer and Olympian Max d’Ollone, he attended the 1906 Consultative Conference for the Arts, Literature and Sports convened by Pierre de Coubertin. At the time of his participation in Stockholm in 1912, he wrote mainly stage works. In 1924 and 1928 he was a member of the jury for the music competitions.",

109684,Shani Davis,Male,13 August 1982,188.0,86, United States,USA,"Shani Davis started roller skating as a child, then turned to speed skating, but was unusual as he competed in both short-track and long-track competition. In 1999, he made the US speed skating team in both disciplines. Davis is also unusual as the first world-class speed skater of African-American heritage. In long track, Davis competed at the World Junior Championships in 2000-02, winning the 1,500 metre race in 2002. He attempted to make the US Winter Olympic team in 2002 in both disciplines, with his best chance figured to be in short-track. But he failed in that attempt, although there was some controversy in the final qualifying race, the 1,000. Davis won the race, which seemingly qualified him for the team but it was rumored that Apollo Anton Ohno, who was dominant among US short-trackers, and who was friendly with Davis, had thrown the race, allowing Davis to qualify for the Olympic team. Eventually Davis made the team but withdrew to compete in the World Junior Long-Track Championships. Between 2002 and 2006, Davis concentrated on long-track and became one of the best skaters in the world. But he continued to compete in short-track winning a gold medal at the 2005 World Championships in the relay. In 2004 Davis was second at the World Allround Championship to US skater Chad Hedrick, but Davis then won that title in 2005 and 2006, and set a samalog world record of 149.359 in January 2005. Going into the Torino Winter Olympics, Hedrick and Davis were considered possibles for gold medals at every distance from 1,000 to 10,000 metres, with Davis better at the shorter distances. Davis won his gold medal in the 1,000, and a silver in the 1,500, but there was controversy in the team pursuit when Davis withdrew to concentrate on his individual 1,000 metre race. Without him, the US team struggled and placed only sixth. After Torino, Shani Davis improved, topping the Adelskalender in 2007 and was still atop that list approaching the Vancouver 2010 Winter Olympics. In 2009 he won the World Sprint Championship, making him only the second skater, including Eric Heiden, to win both the World Sprint and World Allround Championships. He was favored in Vancouver in the 1,000 and 1,500 metres. Although he defended his title in the 1,000, he was upset in the 1,500 and settled for a silver medal.

72564,Mikio Oda,Male,30 March 1905,167.0,65, Japan,JPN,"An extraordinary jumping talent, excelling in both horizontal and vertical jumps, Mikio Oda was Japan’s first Olympic champion. He won the triple jump at the 1928 Olympics by jumping 15.21 metres in the qualifying round. When the gold medals were awarded at the end of the Olympics, Oda had already travelled to a meet in Paris, and his medal was collected by Yoshiyuki Tsuruta, a swimmer who won Japan’s second Olympic title. Oda’s winning distance was commemorated at the Opening Ceremony of the 1964 Tokyo Olympics, when the Olympic flag was hoisted on a pole of 15.21 metres high. Apart from his three Olympic appearances, Oda also won international titles at the Far East Games. He won the triple jump four times (1923, 1925, 1927, 1930), but also medalled in the long jump (gold: 1923, 1927; silver: 1930), the pole vault (silver: 1930), and the high jump (bronze: 1923). On 27 October 1931, Oda bettered the world record in the triple jump with 15.58 m, which was improved by compatriot Chuhei Nanbu within a year. After the war, Oda became a track & field official. Among other positions he held, he was a member of the Japanese Olympic Committee, the technical committee of the IAAF and team leader of the Japanese athletics team at the 1952 Olympics and 1951 and 1954 Asian Games. Oda’s name lives on in the Mikio Oda Memorial International Amateur Athletic Games, an annual sports event in Hiroshima, which was established by Oda himself in 1967. He received the Medal with Purple Ribbon in 1959 and was made an Honorary Citizen of Tokyo, his hometown of Kaita, and of Hiroshima Prefecture. Oda started his athletic career as a runner and soccer player at what is now Hiroshima Kokutaiji High School. In 1922, he set two Japanese records (1.73 in the high jump and 6.29 in the long jump) in the trials for the 1923 Far Eastern Games. In 1923 he joined the Teachers’ Training Center of the Hiroshima Higher Normal School. In 1925, Oda received a scholarship to attend Waseda Senior High School and joined the university’s athletics section. He also competed in the decathlon in the trials for the 7th Far Eastern Games and set a national record in the 4x100 m relay. After graduating from high school, he entered the Faculty of Commerce of Waseda University. While he pursued his own sporting career, he also coached juniors such as Shuhei Nishida. After winning Japan’s first ever gold medal at the Amsterdam Olympics, he was appointed captain of the Waseda racing team. For Waseda, Oda gathered five consecutive titles at Japanese Championships in the triple jump (1925-29), two in the decathlon (1925, 1927), one in the long jump (1926), and three as a member of the university’s 4x100 m relay team. Oda started his professional career at the Asahi Shimbun newspaper in 1931 and also joined the Osaka Asahi Shimbun Sports Club, setting his only world record in the same year. After injuring his foot in Taiwan, he placed only 12th in the triple jump at the Los Angeles Olympics but also served as coach and captain of the track & field team. Hampered by the injury, Oda finished his active career with a second place in the high jump at the 1934 Japan Athletics Championships. The outbreak of World War II and the return of the Tokyo Olympic Games hosting rights stopped his successful coaching career. Just months after the Japanese surrender, Oda organized the first track & field meeting in Japan and was instrumental in restoring the Japan Association of Athletics Federations (JAAF). Beginning in 1949, he travelled to the United States and Europe to learn about the latest developments in athletics and to establish ties with people and organizations. In 1958, the Asian Games took place in Tokyo and Oda was the last runner of the torch relay and lit the flame in the cauldron. One year later, he was entrusted with the task to strengthen athletics in Japan in view of the upcoming Tokyo Olympics. His provisions proved to be fruitful and Kokichi Tsuburaya restored the Japanese tradition by winning the bronze medal in the marathon. After the Olympics, Oda was appointed a professor at his alma mater, the Waseda University.

The Louisiana born Griffin arrived at Barcelona as the outstanding favourite for the gold medal and comfortably won his first round bout. In his second fight he faced Spain’s Rafael Lozano and fell victim to one of the most controversial decisions of the Barcelona Games, Although each of the five judges ruled that Griffin had landed more scoring punches than his opponent the scoring system required three of the judges to push the scoring button within a second of each other for the score to count. Whilst the judges agreed on Lozano’s punches Griffin was not so lucky and lost a decision by six points to five. He turned professional late in 1992. his only loss in his first fifteen fights came by injury but on stepping up to world level he suffered a number of defeats which included an attempt on the world light-flyweight title that ended in a crushing defeat.

Injuries he sustained during his final Olympic appearance forced him to retire after the tournament. Stoffel’s sole major international medal came in the vault at the 1955 European Championships, where he took home bronze. He was also fifth overall at the 1950 World Championships. He competed at four World and six European Championships. Stoffel won sixteen consecutive national championships, from 1949 through 1964, which led him to be twice elected Luxembourg’s Sportsperson of the Year (in 1957 and 1960) and to be selected to carry the country’s flag at the Games in 1964. By career, he worked as a coach for both his club and the national team (1965-72). In 2008 he became a Chevalier in the Order of Merit of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg.

He earned his first two World Cup podium finishes in 1989, as well as a silver medal in the combined at that year’s World Championships, where he was also fourth in the slalom. He returned to the Olympics in 1992, competing in all five disciplines, but did not win a medal; he came closest in the Super G, where he was fourth.

Over the course of his career, he earned 26 World Cup podium finishes between 1988 and 2000, seven of which were victories (thrice in the combined, twice in the Super G, and once each in the slalom and giant slalom). During his athletic career he worked on his family’s farm, but he later became involved in various entrepreneurial adventures. Tragedy struck in 2012 when he accidentally killed a child with a riding mower, but a Swiss court found him not liable because he had told the children several times not to play in the area while he was mowing.

He later taught at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts in Philadelphia. Chapin’s scenes of sports and country life were influenced by European art. He eventually settled in New York and New Jersey. His son, James Forbes Chapin (1919-2009), was a well-known jazz drummer from the 1940s to the 1960s, and his grandson Harry Chapin Foster (1942-81), better known as Harry Chapin, became a well-known songwriter and folk singer (Cat’s in the Cradle) and died in a car crash at the age of 38. None were related to artist Francis Chapin, who took part in the same event in 1932. The Negro Boxer was painted by James Chapin in 1927, like all three entries in oil on canvas. The painting was 86 x 76 cm in size and was on loan from businessman Merle H. Collins (1878-1943) and the Cedar Rapids Art Association in 1932. Unlike this painting, the other two ran in the competition. A Prize Fighter and His Manager of 1930 was sized 53 x 48 cm. The painting showed a sharp contrast between the fighter and his manager, reinforcing the fighter’s vulnerability and precarious future. The attribution of Batter Up, depicting a scene from a baseball game, is unclear. Submitted in 1932, the work was mentioned several times in newspapers and exhibition catalogs over the next two decades. The 1946 U.S. copyright catalog listed a large oil painting (102 x 150 cm) by Chapin with this title, said to have been painted in 1940. This painting is possibly identical to the one from 1932.",

By 1932 she had tied the Olympic record in the 100 metres and was selected to represent Canada at that year’s Summer Olympics. At the Games Strike made it to the finals of the 100 m and held the lead through most of the race, until she was overtaken by Poland’s Stanisława Walasiewicz in the final few metres, although both officially finished in a world record time of 11.9 seconds. Strike then won a second silver medal in the 4x100 metre relay, alongside Mildred Fizzell, Mary Frizzell, and Lillian Palmer. In a precursor to the Velma Springstead Trophy, she was named Canada’s top female athlete by the Women’s Amateur Athletic Federation of Canada. The following year Strike founded the Mercury Athletic Club in Montreal, began training for the 1934 British Empire Games, and came in second, behind golfer Ada MacKenzie, in the first-ever Canadian Press vote for Canada’s female athlete of the year, which would eventually become the Bobbie Rosenfeld Award. She made Canada’s delegation to the British Empire Games and added two more silver medals to her collection in the 100 yards (behind Eileen Hiscock of England) and the 110-220-110 yards relay (with Aileen Meagher and the non-Olympian Audrey Dearnley). She retired from active competition in 1935 and was inducted into the Canadian Olympic Hall of Fame in 1964 and Canada’s Sports Hall of Fame in 1972. In 1981, after an autopsy revealed that Walasiewicz displayed traits of gynandromorphism, or mixed internal sexual organs, there were suggestions that Walasiewicz should be considered disqualified from the 100 metres and Strike awarded the gold medal, but this did not occur.

84549,"Fon, Marqués de Portago",Male,11 October 1928,183.0,70, Spain,ESP,"Fon de Portago was born in London, on 11 October 1928, to a wealthy aristocratic father. His mother was the widow of the equally wealthy American Olympic polo player Frank Mackey and when she died in 1980, de Portago would have inherited a fortune that was estimated at $500 million at the time of his own death. While his father engaged in the Spanish Civil War, Alfonso spent much of his early life in London but later lived in the French city of Biarritz. Playboy Alfonso de Portago excelled in many sports. Besides being a good swimmer, polo player and fencer, he was a very good steeplechaser (on horse), winning the French title and participating in the Grand National at Aintree on two occasions. He achieved his biggest successes, however, in auto racing. He got interested in the sport through his American friend Edmond Nelson, who he had met as an elevator operator in the New York Plaza Hotel. His first race was the Carrera Panamericana of 1953, which he entered together with Luigi Chinetti (ITA) in a Ferrari 375. They did not complete the race, but it was the start of de Portago’s racing career. The following year, he took part in several sports car races, including the 12 hours of Sebring, and the 24 hours of Le Mans. His success in sports car races, driving Ferraris, earned him the attention of the Ferrari team, and he was signed for the team for the 1956 Formula 1 season. Before his first race in 1956 (the 12 hours of Sebring), De Portago engaged in a different sport, although it also involved steering. Together with three of his cousins – Vicente Sartorius, Gonzalo Taboada and Luis Muñoz – he formed the very first Spanish Olympic bobsleigh team to take part in the Winter Olympics held in Cortina d’Ampezzo. With the Sartorius, the Marquis de Mariño as his brakeman, De Portago steered the two-man bob to a fourth place finish, just 0.16 seconds from the bronze, and clocked the second-best time in the third run. The four-man bobsleigh ended up in ninth position. De Portago drove his first Formula 1 World Championship race at the French GP, and scored his first points in the next race at Silverstone, although it was Peter Collins (GBR) who took over de Portago’s car halfway through the race and drove it to a second place-finish. He failed to finish his other Grand Prix races that season, but scored a few victories in minor races. He again scored points in the first race of the 1957 season, although he had to share them again, this time with Froilán González (ARG). A week before the Monaco GP, Alfonso de Portago entered the Mille Miglia, with his friend Nelson, in a Ferrari 335S. At a straightaway near the town of Giudizzolo, one of their tires blew, and their car swerved into the audience, killing at least 10 spectators, injuring many more, and killing de Portago and Nelson. This accident also meant the end of the Mille Miglia race. Portago was also known for his winning ways with women, first marrying model Carroll McDaniel. They separated and he began an affair with another model, Dorian Leigh, sister of the first super-model Suzy Parker. At the time of his death, however, he was having another affair with Linda Christian, the ex-wife of actor Tyrone Power. On the day of his final race, at Mille Miglia, she ran out to kiss him prior to the race, which was captured by many of the paparazzi present, and which became known as “The Kiss of Death.”","Cousin of Vicente, Marqués Sartorius Listed in Olympians Who Participated in the Grand National Steeplechase as a Jockey, Trainer or Horse Owner (Rode as a jockey in 1950 and 1952) Listed in Olympians Who Participated in 24 Hours of Le Mans Races (2 races - 1954 (DNF) with Maserati, 1956 (DNF) with Ferrari) Listed in Olympians Who Participated in Formula One Races (5 races - 4 points (1956-1957) with Ferrari) Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the World Bob & Skeleton Championships (FIBT/IBSF) (0–0–1 1957 St. Moritz bronze: Two-man) Listed in Olympian Members of the Nobility (XVII Marqués (Marquis) de Portago, Marqués (Marquis) de Moratalla, XIII Conde (Count) de La Mejorada, Conde (Count) de Pernia, Duque (Duke) de Alagón, Grande de España) Listed in Olympians Who Died in Motor Vehicle Accidents (Boat/Car/Motorcycle/Train) (Died while racing in the Mille Miglia.)"
