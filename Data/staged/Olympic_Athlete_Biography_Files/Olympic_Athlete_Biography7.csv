In 1923 he and Erik Tegner lost in the final of the World Covered Court Championships in Barcelona. Rovsing’s father died in 1910, leaving him a fortune which he invested wisely, which left him ample resources to devote to his tennis. In 1917, however, his career was derailed when the Danish Tennis Association banned him for homosexuality. This ban stayed in effect until 1921, when it was eased, but in 1923 the Danish Association again excluded him from tournaments. Over the next few years, Rovsing fought this in courts, but in 1928 the Danish High Court upheld the ruling to exclude him from tournaments. This began the cause that occupied the rest of his life. Rovsing wrote, lectured, traveled, and did all he could to speak out on gay rights, especially to allow homosexuals to compete in sports. He used his fortune to support this cause. In the 1950s he wrote for gay journals. In 1955 Rovsing was arrested for having sex with a minor under 18-years-old. He was detained but eventually convicted on some of the charges, with Rovsing given a suspended sentence of 30 days in jail. Rovsing spent his last seven years in a nursing home and died in 1977.

The design no longer followed the model of a 19th century city park in order to provide room for the numerous new inhabitants of this part of Rotterdam and to adapt the park to the existing landscape.

He received a degree in law from the University of Sydney and worked briefly as a lawyer in Australia before attending Harvard Business School. After receiving his MBA he worked in Switzerland, Australia, and London before settling in the United States as a senior executive with Salomon Brothers. In 1980 he became a US citizen, and began his own investment firm, James D. Wolfensohn, Inc., which included among its partners Paul Volcker, former chairman of the US Federal Reserve Bank. In 1995, President Bill Clinton nominated Wolfensohn to become President of the World Bank, and he assumed that post on 1 July 1995. The bank’s board of executive directors unanimously supported him for a second five-year term in 2000, and he became only the third person to serve two terms in that position. After leaving the World Bank he formed Wolfensohn & Company, LLC, a private investment firm and advisory group that provided consulting advice to governments and large corporations. He also became chairman of the International Advisory Board of Citigroup. He also served one year as special envoy for Gaza Disengagement for the Quartet in the Middle East, a post to which he was named by US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice. In 2005, James Wolfensohn also founded the Wolfensohn Center for Development at the Brookings Institution, a Washington-based think tank. He has received numerous honors. He was an honorary trustee of the Brookings Institution, trustee and former chairman of the board for the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton, chairman emeritus of the Carnegie Hall, and of the John F. Kennedy for the Performing Arts in Washington, and was a member of the Council on Foreign Relations.

He then attended Washington State University, where he played freshman football and sprinted on the track team, winning eight Pacific Coast Northern Division titles. He was selected to represent Canada at the 1936 Berlin Olympics, but had to rely on financial help from the British Columbia Track and Field Association. At the Games, he was eliminated in round one of the 100 metres, and placed fifth in the 200 metres and the 4x100 metres relay, in the latter alongside Sam Richardson, Bruce Humber, and Howie McPhee.

She had brought a grace to the sport, which stemmed from her being a ballet dancer since the age of two. She was the daughter of Major William Jepson-Turner, who served as an officer in the Boer and Great Wars, and one of her great-grandfathers was responsible for building the early railways in Argentina in the mid-19th century. Belita’s mother was the daughter of one of King Edward VII’s physicians who made Belita take up ice skating to strengthen her legs, and her mother signed her up to skate at the Westminster Ice Rink in London. The young Belita was duly selected for the Berlin Games and was 12y-112d at the time, one of the youngest ever British Olympians. Despite falling twice during her routine, she showed the character of a mature skater and carried on unperturbed, eventually finishing 16th. Shortly after the Olympics, Belita finished third in the British Women’s Figure Skating Championship, after an exquisite free skating routine. The following year she finished seventh in the World Championships at Earl’s Court, London, after another most graceful performance, which was handicapped after she fell and touched the ice with both hands, which cost her dearly. Before the end of 1937 Belita had quit competitive skating to turn professional under the name Maria Belita, and one of her first paid performances was in the Rhapsody on Ice at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, which opened on her 14th birthday. She also appeared with the legendary Alicia Markova. Following an accident, she went to the United States with her mother to receive treatment in California, before joining the New York Ballet Company, and toured the US for two years in the Ice Capades spectacular before being offered a Hollywood contract to go into the world of movies. After appearing in some low budget films, she first topped the bill in the 1944 movie “Lady, Let’s Dance”. After the War Belita returned to England and staged her own spectacular shows, including a water show with fellow Olympian Johnny Weismuller. By now she had dropped the Maria from her name and was known simply as “Belita”. She continued her movie career, working alongside the likes of Clark Gable and Gene Kelly, and toured with the Charles Laughton reparatory company in the US and Europe. Having retired from skating in 1956, she came out of acting retirement for one last film in 1963. Belita was twice married, firstly to American actor Joel McGinnis Riordan (stage name Joel McGinnis), after which she used the name Belita McGinnis for a while. They were divorced in 1956, and in 1967 she married the Irish actor James Kenny (stage name James Berwick), but it would appear she did not use the name Berwick. Belita and James ran Crabtree Gardens, a London garden centre, from 1967 to 1983. Following his death in 2000 she went to live in France, where she died just before Christmas 2005.",Listed in Olympians Who Acted in Movies (Notably alongside Clark Gable in Never Let Me Go.)

After the Olympics, Anderson entered the US Army where he served as an infantry officer in 1956-57, before entering the University of Minnesota Law School, from which he received an LL.B. in 1960. From then until 1970 he had a busy law practice in Minnesota, but he also became active in politics. In 1962 he was elected to the Minnesota Senate, and served until 1970. On 3 November 1970, Anderson was elected governor of Minnesota by a comfortable margin. He was re-elected governor in 1974 in a landslide victory. While in office, he expressed his concern for the environment and the family farmer by his support for new laws. He also signed into law several bills concerning judicial reform, and bills reforming existing laws on alcohol and drug use. With the election of Walter Mondale as US Vice-President in 1976, Governor Anderson resigned to replace Mondale in the United States Senate. He served in the Senate until 29 December 1978, when he returned to the practice of law in Minnesota. Anderson had appointed himself to Mondale’s Senate seat, which angered the Minnesota populace, led to his defeat at the polls in 1978, and ended his political career. He attempted a comeback in 1984 but did not come close in Democratic primaries for governor. Anderson later practiced law briefly and had several business ventures.","Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the World Ice Hockey Championships (0–1–0 1956 Cortina d’Ampezzo (Olympics) silver) Listed in Olympians Who Were Members of National Legislatures (Member of US Senate, Minnesota 1976-78 (Democrat))"

He created small and large sculptures and since 1906 numerous medals. In 1905 van Gosen was appointed as a professor at the Breslau Art Academy, while from 1908-32 he headed the Künstlerbund Silesia, which he founded. In 1919 he was made a member of the Prussian Academy of Arts. After the closure of the Breslau Academy, van Gosen did freelance work in Wrocław until his death. His works were mainly monuments, statues and busts, and also medals. Theodor von Gosens’s early work is still influenced by Art Nouveau. Many of his works are attributed to the arts & crafts, which he tried to overcome. In 1921 he created a Beethoven monument for Mexico City. His son Markus (1913-2004) also became an artist, studied at the München Art Academy, and worked as a glass artist and muralist at Chiemsee. His father was buried there on the Fraueninsel island. The winner’s medal of the Deutsche Kampfspiele in Breslau 1930 is made of bronze and has a diameter of 90 mm with a weight of about 129 g. At the Munich Art Exhibition in 1927, von Gosen exhibited numerous medals, possibly including the design of the Olympic medal of 1928.

Sedykh first competed internationally at the 1975 Universiade where he won a bronze medal. At the 1976 Olympics and still virtually unknown he surprised the world by winning a gold medal. In 1978, he won the European title, repeating that victory in 1982 and 1986. Sedykh went into the 1980 Olympics as the favorite for hammer gold, after having thrown two world records (80.38 and 80.64) in the spring of 1980. He did not go to the Olympics as the record holder because Sergey Litvinov had bettered the world record of 81.66 two months before the Olympics, but in the Olympic final Sedykh threw a world record 81.80 in the first round to win his second Olympic gold. At the 1983 World Championships, Litvinov finally beat Sedykh, who had to settle for a silver medal, but the Soviet boycott of the 1984 Olympics probably cost Sedykh a third Olympic gold, because a month before the Olympics, Sedykh became the first hammer thrower to break the 85 m barrier, setting a world record of 86.34, more than eight metres better than the winning throw made by Juha Tiainen at the 1984 Olympics. In 1986, Sedykh won the Goodwill Games and set his last two world records (86.66 and 86.74), and the latter, as of May 2020, still stood as the world record. He missed the 1987 World Championships due to injury, but was back at the 1988 Olympics, where Litvinov again defeated him, as he had to settle for silver. In 1991 Sedykh finally won the World Championship. He was also the Soviet hammer champion in 1976, 1978 and 1980. Sedykh retired from sports after the fall of Soviet Union and moved to Paris, and worked as a hammer throwing coach in France and United States. Sedykh first married the sprinter Lyudmila Kondratyeva and later shot putter Nataliya Lisovskaya, with whom he has a daughter Alexia, who won the hammer throw at the 2010 Youth Olympics.

After another bronze medal at the 1988 World Championships, Thomas retired from amateur skating. Unlike most skaters who pursue a professional career, Debi Thomas returned to school to become a doctor, skating only a bit professionally to pay for her studies.

At the München Olympics in 1972 he was eliminated in the heats of the 110 hurdles, suffering from a bout of nephritis. He later studied sports and became a graduate sports teacher. Berkes had an unusual career with many bizarre stories about it. In 1980 he won the Egyptian pole vault title in Cairo, where he had visited the National Championships by chance and was asked to participate as a track and field athlete. In 1971 he set an Indian all-comers record in the 110 hurdles at the Indian All-Comers Championships. The event was held on a lawn ground, with the athletes digging starting holes with a spade, as had been common prior to the 1940s. The starter was a Sikh, who shot with a real gun. Berkes asked him after the race whether he had shot with live ammunition, after which the Sikh showed him by blasting a hole into the ground next to him, creating a large crater, from which a stone flew up and struck the Berkes on the lower leg, causing a bleeding wound.

Four years later in Mexico he achieved the same individual placing and won a team bronze medal alongside Bill Roycroft and Wayne Roycroft. This proved to be his last Olympic appearance although he continued to compete for many years and eventually returned to his ranching roots in the sport of cutting, an American cousin of campdrafting.

Educated at Eton and then Oxford University, he was commissioned into the 12th Lancers in 1922. They would become one of the pioneering cavalry regiments that become mechanised, and Carr was at the fore of this move to armoured divisions, which he led successfully in the Western Desert and North African campaigns during World War II. He served with distinction and was awarded the Distinguished Service Order (DSO) in 1941, and obtained a bar for it the following year. Carr was also made a Commander, Royal Victorian Order (CVO). He was eventually promoted to brigadier and was regarded as a courageous and outstanding leader. Carr returned to England in 1943 and became commandant at the Sandhurst Military College before spending two years in the south-west Pacific as brigadier to British staff in the region. He retired from the Army in 1946, and in 1970 was appointed lieutenant of the Queen’s Bodyguard of the Yeoman of the Guard and was also a deputy lieutenant for Norfolk. One of Carr’s great passions was hunting, and on 27 January 1982 he died of a heart attack while riding with the hounds in Suffolk.

She recovered by the time of the 1949 Austrian Championships and tied Resi Hammerer for first in the slalom, also coming in second behind her in the combined and downhill.

She started rowing at age 17 and had graduated to a place on the national junior squad barely eight months after she first picked up an oar. A year later she was part of a crew that crossed the line in second at the World Junior Championship (although they were then disqualified) and in 2001 she was granted her senior international début. Barring 2003, when she rowed as part of a double sculls partnership with Debbie Flood, she raced every World or Olympic championship as part of the quadruple sculls. The crew reached World finals in 2001 and 2002, but it was only in the Olympic year of 2004 that they made their breakthrough and won the silver medal at the Athens Olympics. The quartet went one better by winning World Championship gold in 2005 but this was to be Romero’s swansong in the sport as a serious back injury and lack of motivation caused her to leave rowing in early 2006. However she still wished to continue as a sportswoman and was able to transfer her strengths as a rower to track cycling. Romero started to train as a pursuit cyclist in spring 2006 and was national champion by the end of the year. She rapidly improved and by the time of the 2007 World Championship had become proficient enough to reach the final of the individual pursuit. Her second appearance at the World Championships came on her home track in Manchester five months before the Beijing Olympics where Romero was to win the individual pursuit gold medal and break the world record on her way to victory as part of the team pursuit. Her performances in the individual pursuit in Beijing were of the highest standard and she defeated teammate Wendy Houvenaghel to claim a historic gold medal victory. Her plan was then to take a year off before returning to the track in an attempt to defend her Olympic title but circumstances conspired against her. The individual pursuit was removed from the Olympic programme by the IOC and Romero decided to switch to road cycling with an eye to competing in the road time trial, This did not prove successful and in late 2011 she announced that she would not be seeking a place at the London Olympics. Romero decided that she would switch to competing in Ironman triathlon events from 2012 onwards.",

He was recruited to his hometown Al Ittihad Alexandria Club, the most popular in Egypt outside of Cairo, in 1944, and in 1948 helped them capture the Egypt Cup, in addition to being the Egyptian Premier League’s top scorer (a distinction he shared with El-Sayed El-Dhizui). He was also selected to be a part of Egypt’s football delegation to that year’s Summer Olympic Games, but did not participate in any of the matches. He was also given an opportunity to represent Egypt at the 1952 edition, but ultimately did not take part. He did, however, have his share of international successes, helping his country win the first edition of football at the Pan Arab Games in 1953 and the inaugural Africa Cup in 1957. He was also the top scorer at the 1957 tournament with five goals scored, one of which built upon a goal scored by Raafat Attia to defeat host nation Sudan in the semifinals, while the rest provided a 4-0 shutout of Ethiopia in the finals. Ad-Diba retired from active competition in 1958, after his club was relegated to the Egyptian Second Division, and became an international football referee. Among the major tournaments he presided over were the 1968 African Cup of Nations (most notably, the final), the 1972 Gulf Cup of Nations, and the 1976 Summer Olympics. Outside of sports, his career was listed as a water manager and a journalist. In 2007 he was named by the Confederation of African Football as one of the 200 greatest African footballers of all time.","Listed in Olympians Who Participated in the 1956 Olympic Football Qualification Campaign (2 App. - 2 goals - 180 min. played: ETH 4:1 (a), ETH 5:2 (h))"

In 1980 he could not compete due to the US-led boycott by the Western countries. Behr earned team gold in 1976, and team silvers in 1984 and 1988. Additionally, he won silver in 1984 in the individual foil event. He won three gold, four silvers and two bronzes at the World Championships, all with the West German foil teams, adding a 1987 silver in the individual event. In 1973 and 1985 Behr won the West German nationals in the individual foil and, in all, he won 10 team golds with his home club FC Tauberbischofsheim. Behr was awarded the Silver Bay Leaf, Germany’s highest sports award, for his successes. At the 1982 Worlds in Roma his match with Volodymyr Smyrnov (Soviet Union), the reigning World Champion, made international news, when a fatal accident happened. Behr’s blade broke and critically injured Smirnov, entering his skull, and Smirnov fell into a coma and died nine days later. This event led to increased safety measures in fencing in the following years. Among other things, the shatter-proof blade and more stable safety vests were introduced. Behr tried several times over the years to contact the widow Emma Smirnova, without receiving an answer. In 2016, the filmmaker Michael Dittrich managed to establish this contact, and he filmed the documentation of Matthias Behr for the Südwestrundfunk Dreams and Trauma of a Foil Fencer. On 13 September 2017, Behr and Emma Smirnova appeared together on Markus Lanz’s famous talk show and discussed the tragic events of 1982. By profession, Behr became manager of the college of the Regional Olympic Center at Tauberbischofsheim. He also became successor of coaching legend Emil Beck as team lead of the West German Fencing National Team for a brief stint.","Husband of Zita Funkenhauser Brother of Reinhold Behr Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the World Fencing Championships (3–4–2 1973 Göteborg silver: foil team; 1977 Buenos Aires gold: foil team; 1979 Melbourne bronze: foil team; 1981 Clermont-Ferrand bronze: foil team; 1983 Wien gold: foil team; 1985 Barcelona silver: foil team; 1986 Sofia silver: foil team; 1987 Lausanne gold: foil team, silver: foil)"

Kaiser of the host club. Taylor joined the Olympic Amateur Wrestling Club the following year, and was beaten by the eventual champion Henry Oberholzer in the featherweight semi-final at the annual German Gymnastic Society Championships. In 1912, Taylor lost to Alec Fournier in the final of Northampton Institute Open, but this led to a call-up to the Great Britain squad for the upcoming Olympics. Although Taylor was predominantly a catch-as-catch-can wrestler (freestyle), all events in Stockholm were in the Greco-Roman style and, despite studying this form of wrestling in advance of the Games to give himself a better chance, Taylor was beaten in his two contests by Swedish opponents. Taylor enjoyed his greatest successes after his Olympic appearance and just a month after the Stockholm Games was beaten by Percy Cockings in the National Amateur Wrestling Association’s (NAWA) English Championship featherweight final. Before the year was out, however, Taylor had collected probably the biggest prize of his career when he won the German Gymnastic Society title. He settled in Australia in early 1913 where he became a longtime physical culture instructor at the YMCA, Knox College, and Church of England Grammar School in Sydney for several decades. Taylor also represented Australia in wrestling at the 1919 Inter Allied Games in Paris, and also became active in boxing shortly after serving during World War I. He also became involved with the Australian Jockey Club, teaching physical education at the AJC Apprentices’ School and managing the jockeys’ room at several race tracks in the Sydney area.

Kennedy won the Huntington Prize in 1941 from the National Association of Women Artists, and the Amelia Peabody Prize in 1948. Both figurative and stylized, her sculptures seek the inner essence of her subjects, tending to feature distorted proportions and natural forms imbued with emotion.

The new style, which Horine had adopted of necessity, was effectively the forerunner of the western roll technique. When Horine was a freshman at Stanford in 1910, his coach ordered him to abandon his new technique and adopt a more traditional style. Initially this paid dividends as, in 1911, Horine jumped 6-4 (1.93) to equal the 24-year-old collegiate record. But in his junior year, Horine reverted, against his coach’s wishes, to his roll technique and the results were startling. First he pushed up the collegiate record to 6-4¾ (1.95), then he broke the world record with 6-6⅛ (1.985), and a few weeks later, he became the first man to jump two meters, clearing 6-7 (2.00). Horine could not maintain this early season form and managed only a bronze at the Olympics. But his world record stayed intact until 1914 and, in 1915, Horine won his only AAU title in the high jump. Horine also competed in the 1912 Olympic Baseball demonstration event. Personal Best: HJ – 6-7 (2.007) (1912).",

921816,Brenda Putnam,Female,3 June 1890,,, United States,USA,"Brenda Putnam was a noted American sculptor and author. Born into a well-connected family, she was the daughter of Librarian of Congress George Herbert Putnam (1861-1955) and granddaughter of book publisher George Palmer Putnam (1814-1872). In her Brenda Putnam Papers she emphasized the significance of her collection by providing not only brief annotations for various items, but often detailed reminiscences of her personal and professional life, thus establishing a context in which to view both her papers as well as her artistic career. Brenda Putnam began her education at the Boston Museum School in 1905, continuing her studies at the Art Students League and the Corcoran School of Art in Washington, D.C. She then established a studio in New York City in 1920 together with Anna Hyatt Huntington. After a period of success in a detailed, conventional representational style from that time until around 1925 with portraits, animals and cherubs on garden fountains, she became dissatisfied with her work. She traveled to Firenze, Italy to recharge her inspiration at the source of great Renaissance sculpture. She also wished to pursue her interest in the more modern simplicity of the emerging Art Deco style, combined with timeless sculptural values, epitomized by the work of Libero Andreotti. The work and ideas of Cubist sculptor Alexander Archipenko also influenced her. After an accident at work in the early 1940s, in which she suffered severe arm injuries, Putnam concentrated on small formats and medals that were closely related to Art Deco. In 1939 she wrote the book The Sculptor’s Way, which is still considered a classical work on sculpturing. Brenda Putnam was also a classical pianist and performed with the well-known Edith Rubel Trio. None of the submitted works of art could be clearly assigned. Thematically similar works are, for instance, Spear Dancer or Nude Male.",

Selwin Calverley’s 153-tonner Brynhild took the line honors but Cecil Quentin’s 96-ton Cicely won on time adjustment. Born in Waterford City, Ireland, Cecil Quentin’s family moved to a farm at Old Court, near Kilmeaden, County Waterford, when he was still very young. In around 1860 the Quentin family left Ireland for Gloucestershire, England. As a friend and one-time business partner of Cecil Rhodes, Quentin was, in his early days, one of the country’s most prominent financiers. He started out as a civil engineer by profession but later became a company director, and lived at Milland, Liphook, Hampshire. As a yacht owner his most notable triumph came when his yachts “Merrythought” and “Cicely” (an identically named successor to his Olympic yacht) raced to numerous victories over the German Emperor’s yacht, “Meteor III” around the turn of the 20th century whilst under the captaincy of Jesse Cranfield. It is theoretically possible that Cranfield may have been the skipper of the boat during the Olympics although Quentin was definitely in Le Havre at the time of the 1900 Olympics.

Privalova made her international début at the 1991 World Championships, winning silver as a member of the Soviet 4×100 relay team. At the 1992 Olympics, she repeated the relay silver and added a bronze in the 100. At the 1993 World Championships, Privalova won her only World title, in the 4×100 m relay and also won silver in the 4×400 relay and bronze in the 200 metres and at the 1995 World Championships, she won silver in the 200 and bronze in the 100.

At the end of the 1990s, Privalova felt that the 2000 Olympics were ter last chance to win an Olympic gold, but she did not think she could win gold in the sprints, as Marion Jones seemed unbeatable at that time and she also did not see her 400 chances as very good, because of Cathy Freeman and Marie-José Pérec, although the latter would retire before the 2000 Olympics. So Privalova concentrated on the intermediate hurdles, an event she had not done before, but one with less competition. And at the 2000 Olympics, running only her sixth race in the 400 hurdles, she surprised by winning the Olympic title, beating the defending champion Deon Hemmings.

After winning four successive Wimbledon singles titles, Reggie faced an agonizing decision in the 1901 Challenge Round. He was again in poor health and his doctor had forbidden him to play but as Laurie had been beaten in an earlier round, Reggie felt that if the Wimbledon title was to leave the family it should not be by default. Against all advice, he decided to play and after winning his first set and leading 5-2 in the second he simply did not have the strength left to copy with the relentless baseline game of Arthur “Wentworth” Gore who sent on to win by three sets to one. Despite this warning, the Doherty’s did not end their career as major championship contenders until five years later in 1906. Seeking their ninth successive Wimbledon doubles title, they came up against the Gloucestershire pair, Sidney Smith and Frank Riesel, in the final. After taking an early lead, Reggie and Laurie were too fail to maintain their challenge and their mother, who had watched the match in tears, mad her sons promise to never overtax their strength again. Laurie immediately turned to golf but Reggie continued to play in selected major events.

He played for Olympique in 1920-21. One problem with the 1920 Olympics is that French rugby does not recognize them as a full international and they don’t collect the stats on the event, so for many years Grenet was unknown, even his full name. Technically the 1920 French team was a “French XV” rather than “France.” However, details of his name have recently been found by French rugby historians at http://finalesrugby.fr/personnes/grenet-armand. In World War I Grenet served as a lieutenant in the 115th Infantry Regiment and the 29th Battalion of Foot Hunters, and received the Croix de Guerre in April 1916 for rescuing several men despite his own injuries. He was decorated with the Legion d’Honneur on 30 June 1921 in a ceremony at Les Invalides. Grenet studied at business school, obtaining assistance from executives at the Banque de France, for whom he worked. In September 1921 he was asked to carry out end-of-month checks on rue Croix-des-Petits-Champs in Paris, after which his superiors noticed 400 missing banknotes, and found that Grenet had vanished with 400,000 francs. Surprising considering his past service, Grenet was found to have been addicted to cocaine, which had caused him to be removed from the Olympique Club earlier in 1921. He was eventually found in a hotel in Bruxelles, hiding under the name Armand Thierry, and was arrested on 6 December 1921. Only 15,000 francs were still in possession although he led inspectors to the site in the Versailles Park where he had buried much of the money pots. Belgium extradited Grenet to France and he was eventually sentenced to one year in prison for the robbery. In December 1922 Armand Grenet married Marguerite Marie Henrietter Faudot. He eventually became a sales representative and lived until 1972.","Listed in Olympians Who Were Sent to Prison (Spent one year in prison for stealing 400,000 francs from his work)"

His best Olympic result was a seventh place at 5,000 metres at the 1928 Olympic Winter Games. At the time he was ill and had to withdraw from further participation in St. Moritz. Staksrud was Norwegian Champion in 1932 and 1934, European Champion in 1934 and 1937 and World Champion in 1930, 1935 and 1937. He died under tragic circumstances in November 1940. His death caused much speculation, since some of his family members were involved with the Germans, who were then occupying Norway, but apparently his death was an accident. Walking in the dark at night, he fell down a cliff and into Gjersjøen Lake. His head hit a stone and he drowned, never regaining consciousness, with his body found the next day. His elder brother Paul Staksrud, also a speed skater in his youth, was found shot to death early in 1945.

Harry Wright was the player-manager of the Cincinnati Red Stockings and included on the team was his younger brother, George, who drew the then-record salary of $1,400 for the season. As the popularity of pro baseball increased, George Wright was to earn much more than this and prospered sufficiently to send his son, Beals, to Harvard. Beals Wright was to become one of the leading players in the early days of lawn tennis in America, but surprisingly he never won his letter at Harvard. He was America’s first Olympic lawn tennis champion, winning the singles and doubles (with Edgar Leonard) in 1904. These two Olympics titles came relatively early in his career although three years previously he had been runner-up in the U.S. singles. Beals Wright was destined to be runner-up on four other occasions, but in 1905 he took the national title by beating Holcombe Ward, a fellow Harvardian. Wright and Ward won the doubles for three straight years (1904-1906) and in 1910, at the age of 30, the left-handed Wright became the first American to reach the final of the All-Comer’s singles at Wimbledon, where he lost to the New Zealander, Tony Wilding, who went on to win the Challenge Round. Wright was a three-time singles champion at the Canadian Championships (1903-04). Apart from these successes, Wright will also be remembered for his contribution to the Davis Cup squad. He was on the team in 1905, 1907, 1908, and 1911 and although the U.S. reached the Challenge Round in three of those years, they never succeeded in winning the Cup. They lost by only three matches to two in 1908 against Australasia in Melbourne, and Wright’s magnificent victories over Tony Wilding and Norman Brooks put the U.S. within an ace of winning the tie. In his later years, Wright maintained his keen interest in the sport and served a term as president of the USLTA.",

89648,Pelle Lindbergh,Male,24 May 1959,174.0,71, Sweden,SWE,"Pelle Lindbergh is considered one of the best ever Swedish goaltenders. Lindbergh had a very successful junior career with Hammarby IF and the national junior team. He won silver at the 1978 and bronze at the 1979 World Junior Championships and was named as the best goalie and was selected to the all-star team in 1978. He won gold at the 1977 and silver at the 1976 European Junior Championships and was named as the best goalie at both of these tournaments. In 1979, Lindbergh made a successful transfer to the senior level and began playing with AIK. He was soon selected to the Swedish national team and, as a back-up goalie for Sune Ödling, won bronze at the 1979 World Championships, which also doubled as a bronze at the European Championships. But at the 1980 Winter Olympics, Lindbergh was the top Swedish goalie and owns the distinction of being the goaltender on the only team that did not lose to the gold-medal-winning United States at the 1980 Olympics, as Sweden and the USA played to a 2–2 tie. After being drafted by the Philadelphia Flyers in the 1979 NHL Entry Draft, Lindbergh started his North American career after the Winter Olympics by playing 1½ seasons for the Flyers’ AHL affiliate Maine Mariners. He was selected as an AHL First Team All-Star in 1981 and that year won the Hap Holmes Memorial Award as the goaltender with the lowest goals against average, Red Garrett Memorial Award as the rookie-of-the-year and the Les Cunningham Award as the regular season MVP. After joining the Flyers in 1982, Lindbergh was selected to the NHL All-Rookie Team in 1983 and played in the 1983 NHL All-Star game. In 1983, he played at the Worlds, finishing fourth, and earned another bronze at the Europeans. Lindbergh led the NHL with 40 victories during the 1984-85 season and won the Vezina Trophy as the NHL’s best goalie, becoming the first European goaltender to win that award. That same year, he was also selected as an NHL First Team All-Star and played at the 1985 NHL All-Star game. After having established himself as one of the world’s top goalies, Lindbergh started the 1985-86 season with six victories in eight games with the Flyers. But in the early morning hours of 10 November 1985, Lindbergh lost control of his customized Porsche 930 Turbo and struck a wall in front of a Somerdale, New Jersey elementary school, critically injuring himself and severely injuring his two passengers. Although declared brain-dead a few hours later, he was kept on life support until his father arrived from Sweden late the next day and his parents gave their permission to terminate treatment. He died on 11 November after a five-hour operation to harvest his heart and other organs for transplant. At the time of the accident he had just left the Coliseum, the former practice center for the Flyers, where he was attending a team party, and he was found to be intoxicated at the time of the accident. After his death, Lindbergh topped the fan voting for the 1986 NHL All-Star Game and it is the only time that a player was chosen posthumously for an NHL all-star team. Since 1994, the Flyers give a Pelle Lindbergh Trophy to the most improved player on the team, voted by team members.","Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the European Ice Hockey Championships (0–0–2 1979 Moskva bronze; 1983 Düsseldorf, Dortmund, and München bronze) Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the World Ice Hockey Championships (0–0–1 1979 Moskva bronze) Listed in Olympians Who Died in Motor Vehicle Accidents (Boat/Car/Motorcycle/Train) (Died from injuries sustained in a car crash.)"

Mason was awarded the Distinguished Conduct Medal for “gallantry and ability” through his actions during an event on 2 March 1915, in which he “made a reconnaissance of the enemy’s position near Zillebeke, under a heavy fire, and obtained information of great value”. Following the war, Mason served at the Army Physical Training School at Aldershot as a physical training instructor where he was also an active swimmer and wrestler in Army competitions. It was during this time that he was selected as a member of the 1920 Great Britain wrestling squad to compete at the Antwerpen Olympics in the heavyweight freestyle category. Unfortunately, he lasted just 6:41 of his opening bout against the American bronze medalist Fred Meyer. Mason retired from the military in 1930 and joined the staff at Heswall Nautical Training School at Heswall as a physical training instructor, working until his retirement in 1954 at age 65.

He got a job as an illustrator of postcards and booklets for children. At the age of seventeen he joined the studio of the then famous painter Giovanni Guarlotti. When he was 30 years of age he met his future wife Pinetta Colonna, also a painter of note. They became a famous artists’ couple in Turin. Together with some friends he founded the “Group Armando Spadini”, named after an artist, who died in 1925 at the age of only 42. While Turin was a center of the Second Futurism, Gamero offered a return to the Italian classical art. During the 1930s he was an acknowledged painter and was teaching students from the Italian aristocracy during spells in the alpine town of Courmayeur. In addition to successful presentations at Milano, Bologna and Nice he participated in the Berlin Olympics, the Quadriennale in Roma and the Biennale in Venizia. During World War II Gamero had to face difficulties and restrictions. He experimented with a monochrome technique, using a tincture that he prepared himself. After the war he moved to Paris for two years, and then travelled to Switzerland and Norway. He could work almost until his death; his deteriorated health forced him to inactivity only in the last months of life. His topics were, amongst others, the industrial landscapes of Turin and snow-covered sceneries, but also still lives. Many of his many muted pictures are expressions of pain, death and mystery. Although the submitted works from 1934 are listed in the catalog as Ludi ginnici in palestra (Gymnastic Games in the Gym) and Ludi ginnici sulla neve (Gymnastic Games in the Snow), respectively, the artist himself titled the latter Raduno invernale (Winter Gathering) for the latter.

68770,Tessa Sanderson,Female,14 March 1956,168.0,70, Great Britain,GBR,"A few months after Tessa Sanderson was born, her father went to England in search of work. When her mother joined him a year later, Tessa stayed in Jamaica where she was raised by her grandmother. In the spring of 1965, however, the nine-year-old Tessa was reunited with her parents, although her joy was tempered by the unattractive contrast between her tropical island home and the bleak industrial Midlands where Tessa’s parents had settled. After some promising performances in schools competition, Tessa Sanderson joined the Wolverhampton & Bilston AC where, in addition to her obvious potential as a javelin thrower, she showed great promise as a pentathlete. In 1975 she won the first of her eight British javelin titles and the following year she improved the UK record three times before finishing tenth at the Montréal Olympic Games. In 1977, Tessa improved her personal best in the javelin by exactly 10 metres and moved into second place on the all-time list; she then confirmed her position in 1978 by taking the Commonwealth title and finishing second at the European Championships. Her ambitions received a severe setback when she failed to qualify for the final at the 1980 Moscow Olympics, but four years later she took the gold medal in Los Angeles to become the first British woman to win a throwing event at the Olympics. Although injury had prevented her from competing in the European and Commonwealth meets in 1982, she did win the Commonwealth title in 1986. But at the 1988 Olympics she was again handicapped by injury and did not qualify for the final. This was not to be her final Olympic appearance as she returned in 1992, where she narrowly missed a medal, and again at the age of 40 in Atlanta. As of 2011, she is the only British woman to compete at six Olympic Games. After winning her third Commonwealth gold in 1990, she won her eighth WAAA javelin title and earned a place on the team for the European Championships. Surprisingly, this was the first time she had competed in the European Championships since winning a silver medal in 1978, but in Split in 1990 she finished back in 12th place. During her career, Tessa Sanderson set ten UK javelin records, of which five were also Commonwealth bests, and in 1981 she twice posted new UK and Commonwealth records for the heptathlon. After her retirement from competition she founded the Tessa Sanderson Foundation and Academy, a charity which attempts to educate youngsters through sport, and also served as a vice-chair of Sport England. She is also a member of the board of the Olympic Park Legacy Company.

68652,June Foulds-Paul,Female,13 June 1934,170.0,63, Great Britain,GBR,"June Foulds was brought up by her grandparents under the illusion they were her real parents. Her birth-mother died when Foulds was eight, and she was led to believe that this woman was her older sister. She only found out the truth three years later when her grandmother also died. Now being raised by her grandfather, he was keen for her to have an interest other than hanging around with other kids on the streets, and so she joined the Spartan Ladies Athletics Club at the age of 15. That was in 1949, and the following year she was the WAAA 100 metres champion. She retained the title in 1951 and won it a third time in 1956 when she was also the 220 yards champion. Foulds made the first of 15 international appearance in her inaugural competitive year, 1950, when she anchored the sprint relay team that won the gold medal at the European Championships in Belgium. She also won the individual 100 metres bronze medal. Foulds won a sprint relay bronze at the 1952 Helsinki Olympics and shortly afterwards married Olympic fencer Raymond Paul. She gave up running for a while and pursued a career in the media and both she and Paul became well-known celebrities, and she even hosted a television programme. After returning to the track, Foulds-Paul as she was then known, added a sprint relay silver at the 1956 Melbourne Olympics and in 1958, won another relay gold at the British Empire and Commonwealth Games in Cardiff. However, her career ended a month later after she pulled an Achilles tendon during that year’s Europeans in Sweden. She retired and had two more children with Paul before their marriage ended and she then married pop singer Ronnie Carroll, in another high-profile wedding. As he came to the end of his pop career, Carroll was offered a job running a hotel in Madagascar but that fell through, and the couple decided to go to the Caribbean island of Grenada along with her five children (one of them being the three-time Olympic fencer Steven Paul), where they ran a beach nightclub, Sadly it failed, and they were declared bankrupt in 1974. Foulds returned to England and with another marriage over, was looking for a way of supporting her family, so she took a stall on the newly opened Camden Lock market in London. After realising there was not a food stall on the market, she opened one and this led to her opening up other food outlets around London under the style of “Mother Huffs”. Her food stall played a pivotal role in the development of the Camden Lock market. Her third husband, albeit for a brief time, was Eric Reynolds, one of the founders of the market.

He exhibited as a teenager and then studied in Stockholm and Paris. In the ensuing years longer stays in France followed. After his return to Sweden, he became known for pioneering stage sets for the Stockholm Opera, also creating more stage sets for the operas in Paris and Copenhagen. The 1920s he spent continuously in Paris again, before becoming professor at the Stockholm School of Art, eventually founding a painting school. Grünewald was a highly productive painter as well as a writer and public speaker. During his lifetime he was one of the most controversial Swedish artists, who was provocative in his colorful, expressionistic images, and was confrontational and quick-witted. The press criticized him constantly as an imitator of Matisse, but the audience loved him. In 1946, he and his second wife Märta Grundell were killed in a plane crash near Oslo. Although there are few other paintings whose works are so numerous on the art market, there is none titled Swimmer After the Bath. Possibly it is one of the many beach scenes Grünewald painted in Skandinavia as well as in various Mediterranean countries.

Still, in 1957 he was voted by his teammates the Donald Angier Trophy given to the Harvard hockey player who shows the greatest improvement over the course of a season. After graduation Owen took a job with a company doing classified research into high altitude balloons and was recruited to play for the US national hockey team. Owen played hockey for Team USA for two more years, during which time he made the 1960 Olympic team. Owen eventually attended Stanford Business School, obtaining an M.B.A. in 1964 but in the middle of his studies he suffered a severe mental breakdown. He was diagnosed as suffering from schizophrenia and spent three years as an in-patient at the Menninger Clinic in Kansas at the end of the sixties. He recovered sufficiently to become a professor of business at Washburn University in Topeka, Kansas in 1973 but periodic schizophrenic episodes would haunt him for the rest of his life. Owen died in tragic and mysterious circumstances in 2007. His body was found in the burnt out wreck of his car in a field outside Topeka. Forensic reports determined that the car’s catalytic converter had set fire to dry grass and that had caused the car to burn ferociously. Although the death was determined accidental, fiends and relatives had reported Owen’s behaviour in the last few days of his life as somewhat erratic.",Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the World Ice Hockey Championships (1–0–0 1960 Squaw Valley (Olympics) gold)

Her stepfather was Louis De Ridder, a multisport Winter Olympian who competed in ice hockey, speed skating, and bobsleigh. Lannoy began figure skating at an early age alongside her sister Francine at the Cercle des Patineurs de Bruxelles, winning junior championship titles in 1937 and 1938. She began competing as a pair with clubmate Pierre Baugniet in 1940; they later went on to dominate the Belgian pair skating scene in the post-war years, winning four straight national championship titles from 1944 to 1947. They also won the first international figure skating tournament after World War II, the 1947 European Championships at Davos and captured the World title weeks later. The following year, they won both the Olympic and World title, and became Belgium’s first Winter Olympic Champions before ending their career. In the following years, Lannoy performed in skating shows in France and England before marrying a fellow Scottish figure skater, Jim Macaulay, in 1953. In that same year, she sadly suffered a personal tragedy when her mother Simone was killed in Germany after being thrown from a moving train. The couple immigrated to Canada in the mid-1950s with their two children, attracted by the potential of the Canadian figure skating scene. Settling in Kingston, Ontario, Lannoy and Macaulay became active in the Canadian figure skating circles as coaches, owing their services to several clubs across the country in several provinces, including in British Columbia, Ontario and Québec.

He was little-known outside of Auckland when he went to the Rome Olympics in 1960 but he became an instant national celebrity when he won the 800 metres, an hour before training partner Murray Halberg also won Olympic gold in the 5,000 metres. Both were coached by Arthur Lydiard. Two years later, Snell set a world mile record in Wanganui and a week later set new world marks in Christchurch for the 800 metres and 880 yards. Later the same year, he won the mile and 880 yards at the British Empire and Commonwealth Games in Perth, but his team was eliminated in the heats of the 4×440 yards relay. In 1964, he successfully defended his Olympic 800 metres title and won the 1500 metres as well. In November 1964, he set world records for the 1000 metres and the mile and then retired from track in 1965. He was twice voted Athlete of the Year by Track & Field News and in January 1970, was chosen as their Athlete of the Decade for the 1960s. Snell moved to live in the United States in the 70s where he gained a doctorate in exercise physiology at Washington State University. He was able to do that by using money he had made in winning the “Superstars,” a made-for-TV event in the US pitting top athletes from various sports against each other in an all-around type competition. He became director of the Human Performance Centre at the University of Texas Southwestern in 1990. In 2000 Snell was voted New Zealand’s Sports Champion of the 20th Century.

Four years later he defended his title in Chamonix only narrowly defeating his main rival Willy Böckl, helped by a big lead in the compulsory figures. In 1928 he won the gold medal for a third consecutive time, the only male figure skater to win three consecutive gold medals. At his last Winter Olympics in 1932, he collided on the ice with a photographer and was runner-up behind another Austrian, Karl Schäfer. He is the only skater to win medals at four Olympic Games. Grafström competed at his first World Championships in 1914, placing seventh, and won the first title after World War I in his home town of Stockholm. Due to occupational constraints, he only took part in two more World Championships, 1924 in Manchester and 1929 in London, taking the world title on both occasions. He never competed at the European Championships, but was also a three-time Swedish Champion. In 1917 he won the Nordic Games and in 1920 the Nordic Championships. Grafström was one of the best skaters ever in compulsory figures. He invented the Grafström-spin and the flying sit spin and was the first skater to perform the Axel-Paulsen jump steadily. He was considered a particularly elegant skater with an enormous feeling for music. He later coached Sonja Henie. Grafström studied architecture at the Berlin Technical University, graduating in 1918 and subsequently worked as an interior designer in London in the early 1920s. From 1925 until his death he lived and worked as an architect in the German town of Potsdam, doing his training on the Bornstedt Lake, when it was frozen over, or in nearby Berlin on the artificial skating rink in the Volkspark (urban park) Friedrichshain. In 1929 Grafström was awarded the Svenska-Dagbladet gold medal. He was a collector of graphics, paintings and sculptures related to skating and was also a writer, painter and graphic artist himself. In 1938 he married Cécile, née von Mendelssohn Bartholdy, the daughter of the banker Otto von Mendelssohn Bartholdy and great-granddaughter of the composer Felix Mendelssohn-Bartholdy. Only two months later he died at the age of 44 from blood poisoning and was buried in the Bornstedt cemetery, but his widow continued his collection, and today it is part of the World Figure Skating Museum in Colorado Springs. In 1976 he was introduced into the Skating Hall of Fame. Potsdam named a street in Grafström’s honor.",Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the World Figure Skating Championships (3–0–0 1922 Stockholm gold: singles; 1924 Manchester gold: singles; 1929 London gold: singles)

He and his teammates, Eugène Van Roosbroeck and Léon De Lathouwer, did not realize there was a team competition in the cycling road race and left London without receiving their medals. It was not until many years later that Van Roosbroeck found there was a team gold medal, and petitioned the IOC to award them the medals. He and Wouters received their gold medals in 2010, although Wouters was too ill to attend the ceremony. De Lathouwer had died by then and never received a gold medal for the event. Wouters was 1948 Belgian amateur road champion and in 1948 won the Ronde van Midden-Nederland. He turned professional in 1951 and had a short career, which ended when his arm was shattered in an accident. Wouters rode professionally for the Alcyon-Dunlop team.

His first international medal came at the 1959 European Championships, when he claimed bronze in the bantamweight category. For well over a decade, Földi would be a fixture on international podiums. His first title came in the 1962 European Championships, held in front of a home crowd in Budapest. He added four more European overall titles (1963-featherweight, 1968, 1970, 1971), while also winning five golds in the individual disciplines of press, snatch and clean & jerk. After three silver medals at the World Championships, Földi first became the world’s best in 1965. His greatest triumph came in 1972 when he won the Olympic gold medal (which doubled as World Championships) after earning a silver medal in 1964 and 1968 (in which he had only lost the gold on body weight). To boot, Földi won the press and the clean & jerk, registering an overall world record - one of his twenty records between 1961 and 1972. After this victory, Földi continued to compete, but with less success. In 1976, he did become the first weightlifter to compete in five Olympics, finishing in fifth place. A year later, an injury ended a career in which he collected 13 Hungarian national titles. Földi, who worked as a locksmith, was honored with induction into the International Weightlifting Federation Hall of Fame in 1993, and in 2009 his home town Tatabánya renamed a local sports hall in his honor.",Father-in-law of Attila Buda

He finally settled in Ontario, playing for the Belleville McFarlands of the Eastern Ontario Hockey League from 1956 through 1960.

His skills at the tournament, where Canada won a gold medal, were so impressive that he was invited by the Kitchener-Waterloo Dutchmen to join them in playing for Canada at the 1960 Winter Olympics.

McCormack had a successful pro career in which he held every available title short of the world championships. The peak of the career came in 1961 when he defeated Harko Kokmeijer of the Netherlands to win the European Middleweight Championships.

Two years later, at the 1984 Summer Olympics, he captured gold in the 200m and silver in the 100m and the 4x100m medley.

He was nearly as successful at the 1987 Pan American Championships, capturing gold in the 100m and bronze in the 200m, and participated at the 1988 Summer Olympics, where he won another silver at the 4x100m medley, but dropped to fourth in the 100m.

The two men routinely worked together at the Antwerp Zoo, and Bugatti taught Collin the importance of working from close observation of live animal models. Like his mentor, Collin chose to depict animals alone or in small groups, focusing on their day-to-day activities. His work also concentrated on the overall form and movement of the animal, rather than attempting to recreate a detailed anatomical model.

In 1964 (Tokyo), she reached the 100 metres semi-final and in 1968 (Mexico City), despite being injured, she twice set the Canadian 100 metres national record with her personal best of 11.3 seconds at altitude. Piotrowski made her big international breakthrough by becoming a two-time Commonwealth Games medalist at Kingston in 1966 (100 yards silver, 220 yards bronze) and two-time 1967 Pan American Games medalist at Winnipeg, where she was the women’s team captain (4 x 100 metres relay silver, 100 metres bronze). At the Canadian Championships, Piotrowski captured national titles in the 100 metres (1964, 1967-69) and 200 metres (1967, 1969). In a meet in Los Angeles in 1967, Piotrowski won silver medals in the 100 and 200 metres defeating three of the greatest runners in the world at the time – Wyomia Tyus, Barbara Ferrell, and Jennifer Lamy. Known for her awkward yet powerful running style, Piotrowski’s athletic career was hampered with injuries, forcing her to retire from the sport in 1973, yet remaining a fitness advocate. Born in Lithuania in 1941, Piotrowski’s parents Ona Maciulyte and Jonas Macijauskas and siblings fled Soviet occupation when she was three-years-old, first living for three years in a displaced-persons camp in Kessel, Germany. The family was sponsored by an uncle to immigrate to Canada, arriving in Halifax in 1948 aboard the ocean liner Aquitania. They settled in Port Coquitlam, British Columbia, after travelling across the country by train, and started a poultry farm. Raised on the farm, Piotrowkski joined the Moody High School track team but did not make her national début until the age of 22, when she was a member of the Canadian record-setting 4 x 110 yards relay team in a meet at 1963 in Vancouver. At the time she was coaching track at the elementary school where she was teaching. Nicknamed “Irene the Dream” and the “hustling housewife” by male sportswriters, her husband at the time, Heinz (a University Club bartender), was her inexperienced coach who learned his skills by reading manuals. Piotrowski studied education at the University of British Columbia, where she played basketball and was part of the cheer squad. Life after track included being married twice, running a jewellery store, moving to Los Angeles, being active in the Church of Scientology, and promoting health and fitness (which led to a photo shoot in an Iron Man Magazine with Arnold Schwarzenegger). She was inducted into the British Columbia Sports Hall of Fame in 1993. Piotrowski died of pancreatic cancer in 2020 at the age of 79.","Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the Summer Pan American Games (0–1–1 1967 Winnipeg ATH silver: 4×100 m relay, bronze: 100 m) Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the British Empire/Commonwealth Games (0–1–1 1966 Kingston ATH silver: 100 yards, bronze: 220 yards)"

This remains a Central African Republic record as of 2015, as does her marathon time of 3:28.41, set in June 1994. Gloum’s next stop was the 1996 Summer Olympics, where a bureaucratic error allowed her to take part, yet not have her results recorded officially. An incorrect qualifying time on her entry sheet cleared her to compete as having passed the A-level IAAF standard when, in reality, no athletes from her nation had met any standards and thus the Central African Republic could enter only one female athlete. Since Denise Ouabangui had competed earlier in the 400 m, this made Gloum ineligible. Yet because this was not communicated to the NOC, Gloum showed up for the race and was permitted to run, even though she was not on the start list. Her exact time was not recorded, but was just over three and a half hours, which would have placed her behind the last official finisher, Marie Benito of Guam. Nevertheless, the official results of the day listed her (as well as Valentina Enachi, a Moldovan athlete who was also the victim of a bureaucratic mistake) as an unofficial competitor and the Olympic report does not mention her at all. Gloum continued to compete through the 1990s and was entered in the 1997 IAAF World Cross Country Championships senior women’s race, but did not start. Her final major competition was the women’s marathon at the 1999 All-Africa Games, but once again she did not start the event.

Their sporting links were further re-enforced by the fact that they were the great-great niece and nephew of 19th century cricketer John Wisden, founder of the famous Wisden Cricket Almanac. It was soon after the ice rink opened near their Brighton home, where their parents ran a sports shop called “Wisdens”, that the siblings took to the ice, and both showed individual skills, with John winning the British junior title in 1947 (having been runner-up the previous year), and Jennifer finishing third in the girls’ event. It was as a pair, however, that they gained their greatest success and, under the guidance of Gladys Hogg at the Queen’s Ice Club in London, they won six consecutive British Pairs titles 1948-53. They competed in their first major international event at the 1947 European Championships, finishing sixth, and the following year made their début at the World Championships. They won their only world title in 1953, having finished second in 1950 and third in 1951 and 1952. When they won at Davos in 1953, they were the first British winners of the title since Phyllis and James Johnson in 1912. They were also European champions in 1953, after two previous thirds (1950 and 1951), and a second in 1952. After their double triumph in 1953, they turned professional in July that year, and Jennifer won the British Open women’s title in 1955 and 1956. They appeared in ice shows worldwide and during one tour of South Africa, Jennifer suffered a heart attack and gave up serious skating to become a skating teacher.

He started his career as a 14-year-old with Bradford St. James’s in 1902 before joining the famous Bradford All Saints club shortly afterwards. He was the Bradford individual champion in 1904 and, in the following two years, was runner-up in the Northern Counties Gymnastics Championship. He made his England international début in 1907 and the following year was third in the English Individual Championship on “home soil” at Bradford. Hanson was the all-round individual Yorkshire champion in seven successive years from 1908-14. During that period, he also helped Bradford All Saints to win the Yorkshire team title on many occasions, and in 1911 led them to the final of the Adams Shield in the British Team Championship, where they lost to Birmingham Athletic Association. During his reign as Yorkshire champion, Hanson appeared in the 1908 and 1912 Olympics, and in the later won a team bronze medal and was the highest placed Briton with 12th place in the individual competition.

In 1911, Mishima started with athletics and took part in the trials for the Stockholm Olympics held at the Haneda Stadium, although he was originally only invited to act as a member of the jury. He actually placed first in the 100, 400, and 800 metre and finished second in the 200. Due to budget constraints, only marathon runner Shizo Kanakuri and Mishima were selected, with Mishima chosen because he was able to contribute substantially to his travel expenses. During the following months, he was coached by the secretary of the US Embassy. Mishima was chosen as the flag bearer at the Opening Ceremony. With his complete lack of international experience, a leg injury, and without any coaching he failed to advance out of the heats in both the 100 and 200. Disappointed, he gave up the right to advance to the semifinals in the 400 m. He left Stockholm before the Closing Ceremony, returning to Japan via Germany, where he bought sports equipment that was not available in his home country. In 1913, Mishima graduated from the Tokyo Imperial University and joined the Yokohama Seikin Bank, where his brother worked.

In 1943, he left the bank to become head accountant at the Imperial Silkworm Warehouse Co., Ltd. After graduation, Mishima continued his involvement in sports and sport administration.

While in the United States, Ofri was noticed by the New York University (NYU) basketball coaches and accepted a scholarship to play basketball there.

After unsuccessfully teaming up with Aleksandr Ruchkin, her coach’s son, Berezhnaya teamed up with Latvian Oļegs Šļahovs and they skated together more than five years. The partnership went well at first, but soon Šļahovs started to become physically and verbally abusive and showed the first signs of mental instability that later put him in a mental hospital. Due to Šļahovs’ conflicting nature, the pair also trained without a coach for most of their career. Despite that, they finished eighth at the 1994 Olympic Winter Games, were seventh at both the 1994 and 1995 World Championships and fifth at the 1995 European Championships. They also won the 1995 Trophée de France. But on 9 January 1996, Berezhnaya was seriously injured when Šļahovs’ blade sliced into her skull while the pair were practicing a side-by-side camel spin. Two surgical operations were performed to remove bone fragments from her brain and the accident caused partial paralysis on her right side, and doctors were unsure if she would walk again. She also briefly lost the ability to speak. But Berezhnaya made an unusually quick recovery, being nursed by Anton Sikharulidze, with whom she had became romantically involved a year earlier. Berezhnaya and Sikharulidze started training together in November 1996 and soon rose to be one of the top pairs in the World. They won Olympic gold in 2002 and silver in 1998. They were also World Champions in 1998 and 1999, taking silver in 2001. They also won European titles in 1998 and 2001 and a European Championships bronze in 1997. The pair initially won the 2000 European Championships, but were later stripped of their medals after Berezhnaya tested positive for pseudoephedrine. She had taken cold medication approved by a doctor but had failed to inform the ISU as required and as a result they were disqualified from sports for three months from the date of the test. The pair also missed the World Championships that year as a result of the disqualification. After the 2002 Winter Olympics, Berezhnaya and Sikharulidze retired from competition and from 2002-06 toured together with Stars on Ice. Berezhnaya married a formed British figure skater Steven Cousins in 2007 and later appeared on numerous Russian ice TV-shows like Star Ice, Ice Age, Kings on Ice and Ice Heart.

The following year, he competed in the 2-man Star Class at the Berlin Olympics with William Welply. They held third place for much of the first half of the regatta but slipped to fourth place overall. Grogono only took up sailing while convalescing after acute mastoiditis spread to his elbow and he could hardly straighten it. Before the Olympics, he sailed for the London Hospital, where he held a position as surgeon, before leaving to go into private practice with his father. At the outbreak of World War II, his elbow prevented Grogono signing up for active service. Because he had an Italian-sounding surname, however, and drove a German car, people believed that he was an immigrant refusing to fight, so he changed his surname to Keith. Then, in 1944, he legally changed his name to Keith Leslie Keith by deed poll. In the winter months, Grogono enjoyed figure skating and skiing, but his first love always remained sailing and, after moving to Sussex, he joined the Littlehampton Sailing Club but, as they would not allow women or children into the club, he resigned to form the Arun Yacht Club in 1956. He was the club’s first commodore, and later president, while wife Molly was on the committee. He continued to race in the Ajax Class, with some of his children and grandchildren as crew members.",Granduncle of David Grogono

Despite his robotic walk, Zucchi went on to not only become the best Italian slalom water skier of all-time, but one of the world’s finest in the 1970s. Zucchi’s active career stretched from 1965-79, with two seasons out of the sport, in 1973-74 and 1977-78. Throughout his career he won countless domestic titles and his collection of international trophies was second-to-none amongst European slalom skiers. He began to ski on Lake Maggiore at the age of 10 and a year later was an Italian schools champion. At 15 he won the first of his 25 Italian titles in slalom and tricks. He won 12 slalom titles in succession, and also won jumping and combined titles. At the 1968 European Championships at Bedford, England, Zucchi won gold in the slalom and combined. This started a long run of European successes that saw him win 12 titles including four consecutive combined championships (1968-71). He also won six slalom titles (1968, 1970-72, 1976 and 1979) plus the tricks title in 1969, and jumping in 1971. At the World Championships Zucchi won the slalom at the village of Thorpe in Surrey, England, in 1975. He won a World bronze in 1979. At the 1972 Olympics, where water skiing was a demonstration sport, Zucchi won the slalom gold medal, the event at which he was particularly dominant at that time. Following his second temporary retirement from competition in 1977, Zucchi graduated with a law degree. He became an active member of the Italian Water Ski Federation, serving on technical and competition committees from 1977-92, and was also vice-president. From 1992-2004, he was president of the Italian Federation of Water Ski and Wakeboard (FISW). In 1995 Zucchi was inducted into the Water Ski Hall of Fame. From 1970 he managed a water ski school at Lake Mergozzo (Novara), and from 1991 promoted the sport among disabled skiers.

This information still appears in many sources. Most likely, she was born in 1895 in Liepaja, Latvia to Jewish parents and grew up in Estonia. There, she first met various artists and exhibited her first sculptures. Gordine studied from 1917-22 first in Tallinn and later in Paris. She was fascinated by East Asian art at an early age and became well-known in 1926 with the bust of a Chinese person. She set up a studio in Boulogne-Billancourt near Paris. During the following years, she exhibited successfully in Paris and London. As part of a multi-year trip to Southeast Asia starting in 1929, Gordine also opened a studio in Singapore and created four sculptures for the town house there. By marrying her first husband, medical officer Dr. George Herbert Garlick, she was automatically awarded British citizenship. She left Singapore and her husband in 1935. After her marriage to diplomat and professor of Russian culture Gilbert Richard Hare (1907-66) in the following year, she moved to London where she was introduced to London’s higher society, and whose members became her exemplars. In 1949 she became a member of the Royal Society of British Sculptors. The manor that was built for Dora and Richard Hare according to their own designs, called Dorich House, was turned into a museum. Two of her siblings, Nicholas and Anna, were murdered in Tallinn in 1941 by the Nazis. Gordine’s work was influenced by Frenchman Aristide Maillol and by Asian art. In addition to typical ethnic heads, she created portraits come of academics, actors, dancers and members of the high society. The bronze figure Atalanta sized 40 x 44 x 29 cm was created 1946-47 and is kept in the Dorich House. Several casts were made in the 1950s. The sculpture symbolizes the Greek myth of the virgin huntress Atalanta.",

68857,Roger Bannister,Male,23 March 1929,187.0,70, Great Britain,GBR,"At 6.03 pm on 6 May 1954, six runners set off in the mile race during the annual Oxford University versus the AAA race at the University’s Iffley Road track. A little over seven minutes later, with Roger Bannister collapsed into the arms of his fellow Olympian, the Reverend Nick Stacey, the trackside announcer, Norris McWhirter, of Guinness Book of Records fame, announced to the crowd: “The result of event number six, the one mile, winner R. G. Bannister of Exeter and Merton Colleges, in a time which will be a new English record, a new track record, a new British Empire Commonwealth record, a European record, a world record - in three…” The rest of the time could not be heard above the cheering and applause of the crowd, who had witnessed the breaking of the one mile four-minute barrier. McWhirter eventually read out the remainder of the time which was: “Three minutes, 59.4 seconds.” An hour before the race, the weather was so bad that a record attempt was inconceivable, but the rain stopped, and the wind died down as Bannister decided to go ahead with the record attempt. Joining him in the line-up were Chris Chataway, who would finish runner-up to Bannister, Chris Brasher and Tom Hulatt, (who finished third), all from the AAA, while Alan Gordon and the American George Dole ran for the University team. Chataway and Brasher acted as pacemen for Bannister, who had tactically worked out how he was going to attack the record – and he did that to perfection. With a touch of irony, when Bannister was an Oxford undergraduate, he helped lay the cinder track at Iffley Road. It was a record that Bannister, the Australian John Landy and American Wes Santee had all been chasing, but it was the British doctor who carved his own piece of track history on that day at Oxford, as he broke Sweden’s Gunder Hägg’s near nine-year-old world record by two seconds. The tea-time news was interrupted by the BBC, and a re-run of the race was played non-stop throughout the evening, it was that memorable. Had Bannister won a gold medal at the 1952 Olympics, however, he may not have attempted the world record because, by his own admission, he probably would have retired after the Helsinki Games had he done so. Born at Harrow, north London, Bannister’s father hailed from a run-down cotton town near Burnley, Lancashire, before obtaining a post in the Civil Service in London. Roger was evacuated to Bath during World War II and attended the City of Bath Boys’ School. On returning to London, he attended University College School, Hampstead, where he played rugby, rowed, and showed his superiority as a runner. He sat the University entrance examination at the age of 16, and won a medical scholarship at Exeter College, and later Merton College, Oxford. He took a BA in physiology before moving to St Marys’ Hospital, London to finish his clinical studies Bannister started running seriously at Iffley Road in 1946 when, as an undergraduate, he won the Oxford University Freshman’s Mile in seven seconds under five minutes. He was considered for the 1948 London Olympics, but felt he wasn’t ready to compete at such a level at that time. He won the 800 metres bronze medal at the 1950 European Championships, however, and in 1951 captured the first of four AAA titles, when he won the mile. He won the 880 yards in 1952 and the mile again in 1953 and 1954. In between he could only finish fourth in the 1500 metres at the 1952 Olympics. Despite being the favourite to win gold at Helsinki, Bannister had done very little training leading up to the Games, but still felt he had the burst of power in his legs to put in his famous final burst to clinch gold. That was until the organisers re-scheduled the event, which meant a heat, semi-final and final on consecutive days, which proved too much for him. Despite being in a good position going into the last bend in the final, Bannister’s legs would just not go, and he finished fourth. Bannister held his historic world mile record for just 46 days, before John Landy reduced it to 3:57.9 at Turku, Finland on 21 June 1954. The two men then met in the mile at the British Empire & Commonwealth Games just over six weeks later, in a race that had several billings, including the “Mile of the Century”. Landy led with 50 yards to go until Bannister overtook on the outside, while the Australian looked over his shoulder on the inside, and Bannister went on to win the race in which both men beat the four-minute barrier for the second time in their careers. Bannister returned to Europe and competed in the European Championships at Berne a few weeks later, and won the 1500 metres to become the first Briton to win the Commonwealth-European double in the same year. Despite Britain’s wealth of middle-distance runners over the years, only one other man, Steve Cram (1982 and 1986) had emulated this feat at the time of Bannister’s death in 2018. Victory in Berne was to be Roger Bannister’s last race, as he could not devote time to training and competitive running due to him being a qualified doctor. He obtained his medical degree in 1955, when he was awarded the CBE, and also published his first book The First Four Minutes. Bannister was soon established in his profession as a consultant physician before he started training in neurology after completing his two years National Service in 1959. He became one of the Britain’s leading neurologists, After a 12-month scholarship to Harvard University, Bannister returned to London and was appointed consultant neurologist at the Western Ophthalmic and St Mary’s hospitals. He remained there until 1985. During which time he became a fellow of the Royal College of Physicians. Between 1985 and his retirement in 1993, he was master of Pembroke College, Oxford. With his vast knowledge of neurology, Bannister was involved with many leading publications on the subject, including editing Autonomic Failure: A Textbook of Clinical Disorders of the Autonomic Nervous System, the textbook Clinical Neurology for many years, and was also the editor of Brain’s Disease of the Nervous System for several editions. Despite his commitment to medicine, Bannister still found time to stay involved with sport. He became the first chairman of the Sports Council in 1971 and, during his tenure, led a crusade on drug-testing for anabolic steroids. He was also involved in the Sport for All campaign, and was president of the International Council for Sport and Physical Recreation (1976-83). He also managed to write articles for the Sunday Times and the American magazine Sports Illustrated. Following a car accident in 1974, Bannister broke an ankle which made walking uncomfortable for the rest of his life, and in an interview in 2014 he revealed that he had been suffering from Parkinson’s Disease since 2011 during which he said: “I have seen, and looked after, patients with so many neurological and other disorders that I am not surprised I have acquired an illness.” Which he said was: “A gentle irony.” Bannister was knighted for his services to sport in 1975, and was made a Companion of Honour in the 2017 New Year’s Honours. The Iffley Road track at Oxford is now rightly called the Roger Bannister running track in Bannister’s honour.

In 1908 he took orders for decoration works like the mosaic for the dining hall at the Representation House at Prague and some other fresco works. From 1911-13 he started oil painting, especially with gypsy motifs. In 1919 Obrovský became a professor at the Academy of Fine Arts in Prague and from 1935-37 was its principal. His sculptural works began only in 1923, although he was interested in this discipline since his early youth. He mainly created sport motifs, female nudes, and antique figures, which he created primarily from marble and bronze. Despite his Olympic medal in 1932, he was a member of the “French Committee against the Execution of the Olympic Games at Berlin 1936” and refused to participate. The bronze The Javelin Thrower (Vrhač oštěpu) was created at the end of 1923. Today, the medal-winning statue Odysseus stands in the garden of the Sternberg Palace in Praha (Prague). The version sent to the Los Angeles Olympics was 90 cm high, its life-size copy 212 cm. The idea for the work emerged immediately after the First World War. However, the sculpture was not completed until 1932. The actual title was Vraždící Odysseus (Murdering Odysseus). It represents the Greek hero fighting against the suitors on his return to Ithaka. To emphasize the sport motif, it was supposed to be submitted as a Javelin Thrower. Eventually, it was simply called Odysseus in the catalog. Volleyball appears in Czech sources as Girl Plays Volleyball (Dívka hrající volejbal). It is probably the bronze figure Girl with Ball (Dívka s míčem). The 50 cm high statuette Victory (Vítěz) was created in 1923. However, there is another statue dated 1933 with the title Vítězi! representing the goddess of victory that was actually to be shown in Berlin, but Obrovský refused to take part. The entry Runner (Běžec) could well be the bronze statue Runner after the Start (Běžec po startu).",

Markin captured his second gold in the 4×400 relay when he outran the East German Volker Beck on the anchor leg.

Illness ruled out a naval career and instead he pursued a career in the boat building industry and also built up a reputation as one if the best young dinghy sailors in the country. With the advent of World War Two he joined the Naval Reserve and would go on to command a naval gunboat patrolling the English Channel. He eventually reached the rank of Lieutenant Commander. At the end of the war he went to work for Fairey Marine and one of the projects he was involved in was that of bringing the Firefly dinghy into full production. The Firefly was to become an Olympic boat in 1948 and Currey, with expert knowledge of both boat and local water conditions, was considered a strong contender for the Olympic title but he was not picked for the British team as a more experienced sailor was favoured by the national selection committee. Both Currey and the company he worked for were pioneers of the new Finn dinghy in the early fifties and he was selected to compete at the Helsinki Olympics where he placed second behind the legendary Paul Elvstrøm but ahead of the boat’s designer Rickard Sarby. Currey’s career brought him success in a wide variety of dinghies over a period of forty years and also encompassed some powerboat racing. An accomplished dinghy builder and designer he became managing director of the Fairey Marine Company in the sixties and was one of those responsible for overhauling the rules of Finn class racing during that decade.

He began serious involvement in athletics as a pole vaulter at the age of 15 and soon graduated to the decathlon, in addition to his involvement in rugby (league and union), Australian rules football, swimming, tennis, hockey, and water polo. After breaking the Australian record for the decathlon in 1946 by almost 1000 points, he captured medals in state and national championships in multiple track and field events on the road to being selected for the 1948 Games, as a national championship for decathlon had failed to resume following World War II. Although he placed out of the podium in London, he did manage to set a new Australian record with a score of 6739 by contemporary standards (6334 today). Following the 1949 Australian national championships, where he picked up one gold and two bronze medals, Mullins fame as a basketball star began to grow. He was a member of three championship-winning squads in his home nation before travelling to North America and attending Washington State University on a track scholarship, where he received a bachelor’s and a master’s degree in physical education in 1953 and 1954 respectively. During these years he was both an athlete and basketball player for the school and, in 1955, he joined the University of British Columbia as a staff member and coach in the School of Physical Education. He continued his role as a player by joining a senior league and helped represent Canada at the 1959 World Basketball Tournament in Chile. After his playing days were over Mullins earned his doctorate in education in 1961 and, in 1963, became the head coach of UBC’s basketball team.

He first worked as a riding instructor at a Vermont summer camp, but then in 1990 set up his own business in New Jersey teaching lessons, training and showing young horses, and selling horses. Some of his most notable successes in his career were when he was part of the 2001 Irish gold medal team at the European Championships in Holland, was eighth individually at the 2002 World Equestrian Games in Jerez, Spain and joint fourth in the 2004 Athens Olympics. Initially he finished joint fifth at the 2004 Olympics on Carling King, and the Olympic gold medalist was Ireland’s Cian O’Connor – but his horse Waterford Crystal failed a drug test taken during the Olympics, and subsequently lost his Olympic title.

85476,Ole Ellefsæter,Male,15 February 1939,183.0,79, Norway,NOR,"Ole Ellefsæter grew up in Ringsaker, a municipality neighboring the town of Hamar. In 1958, at the age of 19 he was Norwegian junior champion in 10 km cross country. He was Norwegian senior champion three times, 15 km in 1964 and 50 km in 1965 and 1967. His international breakthrough as a cross country skier came at the 1964 Olympic Winter Games, placing 8th in the 50 km race. In the 1966 World Championships in Oslo he was a member of the gold medal winning relay team, won a silver medal in 15 km and placed fourth in the 50 km race. In 1967 he had a great season as a 50 km skier, winning both the Norwegian Championships and the big international competitions in Holmenkollen and Lahti. His two gold medals in the 1968 Olympics were therefore unsurprising. In 1971 he was the first Norwegian skier to win the famous Vasaloppet in Sweden, being persuaded to compete by his Swedish friend Bjarne Andersson, who was second in the race. He finished his Olympic career by placing 10th in 50 km at the 1972 Winter Olympics, aged 33. Ellefsæter was also an excellent track athlete, winning six Norwegian championships in the 3000 m steeplechase in a row from 1960-65. In 1962, he almost created a sensation in a national dual match against Yugoslavia at Bislett Stadium in Oslo, winning the 3000 m steeplechase in 8:43.8, only 1.4 seconds behind Olympic bronze medalist Ernst Larsen’s Norwegian record and only 13 seconds behind the world record. He was selected for the 1962 European Athletic Championships, but was unable to qualify for the final. Ole Ellefsæter also had success as a singer. His single “Huldreslåtten” from 1966 became a national hit and sold over 25,000 copies. In the summer of 1968 he had another hit with “Alle kluter til”, the text focusing on the recent Norwegian Olympic success in Grenoble. He published two LP-records, “Viser og gamle takter” (1967) and “I godt lag” (1969), lyrics mostly written by his neighbor, the author Guttorm P. Haugen (1911-). Ole Ellefsæter worked several years as a lumberjack, and later studied to be a forestry technician. He got his nickname “Uteligger” (Homeless) from his skiing teammates after a long training session in the forests around his home. He was taken by surprise by the darkness, and was forced to stay the night in the forest with no shelter. For his accomplishments in cross-country skiing and athletics, Ellefsæter received the Egebergs Ærespris in 1965. In 1967 he was awarded The Holmenkollen Medal. A statue of him is raised in Brumunddal, the center of his home municipality of Ringsaker.","Listed in Olympians Who Were Awarded the Holmenkollmedaljen (1967) Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the World Nordic Ski Championships (3–1–0 1966 Oslo CCS gold: 4×10 km relay, silver: 15 km; 1968 Grenoble (Olympics) CCS gold: 50 km and 4×10 km relay) Listed in Olympians Who Won the Vasaloppet (1971 (5-12:56) first Norwegian winner) Listed in Olympians Who Were Awarded Egebergs Ærespris (1965 - cross country skiing and athletics)"

In 1940 Konsmo became Norwegian junior champion after a close duel with Yngvar Karlsen, who 12 years later became a member of the Norwegian Olympic speed skating team at the Oslo Games. During World War II Konsmo skated a few “illegal” races – organized secretly by the home front. In 1942 he skated the 10K in 18:00.9, an all time PB. In 1946, Konsmo placed fifth at the Norwegian Championships, his best ever, and placed sixth in the unofficial European Championships. After coming second and fourth at 1,500 m in two important competitions in early January 1948, he was selected for the St. Moritz Olympics. In a selection race over 1,500 m two days before the opening of the Olympic speed skating competitions, Konsmo was paired with Hjalmar Andersen. Both skated PBs, Andersen recording 2:19.9 and Konsmo 2:20.0. It was decided that Andersen should skate the 10K in the Games, and Konsmo the 1,500 m. Konsmo ended 10th, but Andersen did not finish his 10K under very bad conditions, although his Olympic glory would come four years later. In 1952 Konsmo tried to qualify for another Olympic start, but did not succeed. He had a very long skating career, skating his best 500 m at age 35 in 1958 (43.8), and at age 66 he skated 48.4 in the 500 m, his last season as a skater. His younger brother by six years, Roald Konsmo, was also a decent speed skater, with PBs of 43.7 and 2:22.1, winning the 500 m at the 1948 junior championships and placing third and second in the 500 at the 1949 and 1950 Norwegian Championships, which made him a candidate for the 1952 Olympic team. Together the two brothers owned a construction firm, Brødrene Konsmo, which specialized in housing construction in the Oslo area. Gunnar’s son Øystein Konsmo (born 1952) placed 14th in the 1978 World Sprint Championships after placing fourth at the national sprint championships the same season.

25279,Harry Sharratt,Male,16 December 1929,,, Great Britain,GBR,"Harry Sharratt refused to turn professional because the money he made as a teacher of mathematics combined with the expenses received playing for a top amateur club was more than he could expect to earn as a full-time footballer. A goalkeeper with Bishop Auckland FC at a time when they dominated English amateur football, he won three successive FA Amateur Cup winners medals between 1955 and 1957 and played six times for the English national amateur team. A colourful and eccentric personality, when he was told that he been named by a magazine as the fourth best goalkeeper in the world, he asked “What’s so special about the other three?” He would ask for sweets and cigarettes from the crowd (although he refused to smoke the cigarettes until the match had ended) and on snowy days would have snowball fights with supporters. Sharratt is probably the only man in football history to be cautioned for building a snowman on the goal line, “It was a good one as well” he was quoted as saying. Bishop Auckland was so dominant in their league that he was able to entertain the crowd with such tricks as playing an entire half with only one boot or if the team were winning easily he would throw the ball to an opponent just to wake up his defenders. On one memorable occasion Bishop Auckland were 12-0 ahead in a cup tie when Bob Hardisty, the captain, told them to “go easy” on their opponents. Sharratt rested himself against the goalpost and failed to move as their opponents quickly scored four goals. Hardisty came over to Sharratt and said “Not that bloody easy, Harry! not that easy!”. When asked about his behaviour he said “It’s only a game. I do it because I want to enjoy it.” Sharratt also played briefly for Blackpool, Oldham Athletic and Nottingham Forest.",

He finally achieved success at the 1966 Nordic Ski World Championships, where he took bronze in the Nordic combined. He then entered the 1968 Winter Olympics as a favourite alongside West Germany’s Franz Keller, the 1966 silver medalist (the 1966 gold medalist, Georg Thoma, had retired). In the Nordic combined event, Keller won the ski jumping portion, while Kälin was victorious in the 15 km, but the latter’s poor score in the jumping cost him the gold. Nonetheless Kälin’s silver was the first Olympic Nordic combined medal won by Switzerland. He also finished 5th in the 4x10 km relay and 23rd in the 50 km at these Games. Kälin’s Olympic career, however, was not yet over. At the 1972 edition, after placing 7th in the 30 km and 17th in the 15 km, he joined Albert Giger, Edi Hauser, and Fredel Kälin to win a bronze medal in the 4x10 km relay, Switzerland’s first Olympic medal in the cross-country skiing relay.

His interest in coins was piqued in the 1870s and 1880s as a child, when he saw the design of several new coins. In 1880 he was severely injured when a shotgun blast accidentally hit him in the left leg, leaving him with difficulty walking due to that leg being 4-6 inches shorter than the right leg, and requiring use of a cane for the rest of his life. To overcome this disability he took up swimming for exercise. Adams joined up with the Bath Beach Swimming Club and later swam for the Human Fish Club and the New York Athletic Club. He won the Metropolitan AAU Championship for plunging from 1902-05. After the 1904 Olympics, Adams began writing a column on hobbies, especially coin and stamp collecting, for New York newspapers. He also began publishing articles in The Numismatist. He later became the editor and publisher of this magazine. He also worked in the newspaper trade early in his life as a compositor. Adams became prominent in the American Numismatic Association (ANA), serving on the Board of Governors. He declined election as a vice-president, which would have led to his becoming president. He also served on the Membership Committee of the New York Numismatic Club in 1910, and was a member of the Pacific Coast Numismatic Society, and the Chicago Numismatic Society. In addition to his journal articles, Adams later wrote several books on coin collecting. In 1969 the ANA named Edgar Adams to its Hall of Fame.","Listed in Olympians With a Disability (Severely injured when, as a child, a shotgun blast accidentally hit him in the left leg, leaving him with difficulty walking due to that leg being 4-6 inches shorter than the right leg.)"

As a rider and trainer he had a reputation across Europe. He was appointed lieutenant colonel in 1939 and retired in 1943. As a professional soldier, he was an excellent rider. In 1925 he became a Hungarian champion in show jumping. He competed in the 1928 Olympics in both show jumping and military. In the latter event he fell in cross country riding but continued to ride. He was taken to hospital with a concussion, but he was still involved in the next day’s show jumping part. One of his jumps was judged illegal and he was disqualified. Cseh was a farmer from 1949 onward, although he asked for a return to the army without success. The generally excepted story is that during World War 2 Cseh was the commandant of the Dawidowa concentration camp where his fellow Olympian Attila Petschauer was a prisoner. Petschauer was singled out by Cseh for particularly sadistic treatment. In winter he had to fetch water for the kitchen barefoot or had to sleep naked on trees with water poured over him as well as being beaten with a wire whip so severely that his spine was exposed. More recent research from Hungarian military archives has cast a little doubt on the exact details of the story as records state that Peschauer died during an outbreak of typhus that spread through the camp - rather than being tortured to death. In 1944/45 he participated in the resistance movement. The Nazis locked him up and deported him to the West.",

He joined the Cuban national team in 1943 and had many years of international experience prior to his selection for the delegation to the 1948 London Olympics. There, Cuba was eliminated in the round robin and placed 13th overall in the classification round. García-Ordóñez was chosen to carry the national flag during the Opening Ceremony. García-Ordóñez competed at the 1951 Pan American Games, where he took home a bronze medal with the national squad. A player for the Vedado Tennis Club, he won national championships with that team in 1956 and 1957, in addition to a junior title in 1943, and retired from active competition that same year. In addition to basketball and swimming (in which he held two premiere league records), he also rowed, competed in shot put, and played pelota, squash, and golf. He later had a career as an attorney in Cuba, but was exiled to the United States and built a second career with the Plough, Inc. company. His brother, Carlos, also played basketball and was a member of the Cuban team at the 1952 Helsinki Olympics.",Brother of Carlos García-Ordóñez

After the Melbourne Games Rose enrolled at the University of Southern California and at the 1960 Olympics, he retained his 400 metres title, won silver in the 1,500 metres, and a bronze in the relay. His total of six Olympic medals would surely have been greater but for the fact that he was not selected for the 1964 Games as he refused to return from California for the Australian Championships, the qualifying meet. Earlier in the year Rose had set world records for 880 yards and 1,500 metres and would certainly have been a medal contender in Tokyo. During his career he set 15 world records, 9 in individual events, with two at 400 metres, one at 800 metres, and two at 1,500 metres, over currently recognized events. His international career ended at the 1962 British Empire and Commonwealth Games, when he won four gold medals, in the 400 and 1,500 freestyles, and two in relay events. Rose continued to enjoy competitive swimming long after his Olympic career was over and in 1981 he won the World Masters title in faster times than he recorded at the 1956 Games. A vegan, Rose was often called The Seaweed Streak for what was then an unusual diet. He settled in the United States where he worked in movies and the television industry and managing a company which sold nutritional supplements, but he eventually returned to live in his native Australia.

The bronze medallist at the 1977 World Junior Championships, Van der Duim debuted with the seniors in 1978. He competed in all five distances at the 1980 Olympics, his best finish being fourth in the 5000 m. It was quite a surprise when he became World Champion a week later in his hometown of Heerenveen, becoming the first man to beat Eric Heiden in an international championship since 1976. However, it was later revealed by the ice master that he had manipulated the ice breaks in Van der Duim’s favor. The following season, he was in pole position to win the European Championships, but fell during the final distance. Unwilling to talk to the press, he declared he had slipped because of “bird droppings”, a phrase that stuck with the public. At the World Championships that same year, Van der Duim again made the news in a less desirable way: he finished his 5,000 m race one lap too soon. He only realized this after shouting from the audience and his coach, and still managed to finish ninth. A fall in the 1,500 m ruined his chances to retain his title. He made up for the 1981 season the following year, finishing third in the European Championships and winning his second World title. In 1983, after winning his first European title, Van der Duim was briefly suspended from the Dutch skating team after appearing on TV while wearing clothing from a different sponsor than that of the Dutch federation. His appearance at the World Championships was also notable, but not because of his performances, but because of his suit. After the example of cycling, he wore a “rainbow suit” as the reigning World Champion. He closed the season on a high, taking the bronze in the World Sprints. In spite of a second European title, the 1984 season was disappointing, mainly because he failed to win a medal at the Winter Olympics in Sarajevo. After the 1985 season, Van der Duim quit long-track skating and switched to marathon skating. He was fairly successful in marathon, placing eighth in the 1986 Elfstedentocht, and winning the Dutch championships on natural ice. On 28 November 1986 Van der Duim broke the unofficial 1-hour World Record with 39,492.8 m during the opening of the new indoor rink in Heerenveen. On 6 February 1987 he became involved in a car crash in which one person was killed, and his injuries forced him to quit skating.

Following his older brother Laurence, who was also a good polo player, Walter went to Cambridge University and graduated in 1894 with a 2nd Class law degree. As a polo player, he represented the United States at the 1900 Westchester Cup. Due to his wealth, McCreery was able to indulge his love of equestrian sports, which included polo and foxhunting. He often played on a polo team of Cambridge graduates called the Old Cantabs, which was unbeaten for two years and won the Champion Cup at Hurlingham in 1900. He won the coveted Bledisloe Warwickshire Cup on three occasions, with Old Cantabs in 1899, Stockton House in 1903 and Friz Hill in 1904. Two of McCreery’s sons, Richard and Walter, Jr., both became top American polo players in the 1920s, with Walter, Jr. a force on the California polo scene. Richard entered the military and became commander-in-chief of the British of the Rhône. The book The Last Great Cavalryman: The Life of General Sir Richard McCreery was about him, Both brothers served in the 12th Royal Lancers Division in World War I. Another son, Robert, a member of the 17th Royal Lancers, was killed by the IRA (Irish Republican Army) in the Ballyturn Ambush in May 1921. His youngest son, dramatist John Buchanan McCreery, was killed when he fell in front of a train at Euston Station, London in 1931. In 1909 Walter McCreery went through a difficult time. He became violent and abusive and lunacy proceedings were issued against him in England. He escaped to Belgium and then to Los Angeles where, in 1912, after his family’s concerns for him, he was put under restraint and declared to be an incompetent person, Both the English and LA orders were eventually lifted. Although McCreery was a US national all his life, at the 1900 Paris Olympics he played for BLO Polo Club, Rugby, a British polo club.",

In his late teens, he came to Brazzaville, the then capital of the French colony, to finish his education and it was there that he started boxing. Around 1960, M’Bouroukounda went to France to study art, and also continued to box, and was able to win regional titles in the Paris area. When he returned to the now independent Gabon, he settled in Libreville before returning to Europe in 1972 to become Gabon’s first ever Olympic competitor, when he participated in the Munich Games. He remained his country’s only Olympic competitor for the next twelve years, as Gabon did not compete again until the 1984 Games. Soon after the 1972 Olympics, M’Bouroukounda finished his active career, but stayed involved in boxing as a coach, and also served as president of the Gabonese Boxing Federation from 1975-78 and again in 1985. Besides boxing he worked as an art teacher in Libreville up to his retirement. Unfortunately he became blind, and also lost his memory in later years.

The forward, sometimes called “The Great White Hope”, was considered one the greatest pure shooters ever. He suffered from back injuries in the later years of his career, but despite this, was named to the legendary American “Dream Team” that played at the Barcelona Olympics. While Bird’s playing time was limited, the Americans easily took the gold. Following the Olympics, Bird retired from the sport, assuming an assistant coaching position with the Celtics.

82399,Raisa Smetanina,Female,29 February 1952,162.0,53, Soviet Union  Unified Team,URS,"Over a long career that encompassed five Olympics, Raisa Smetanina compiled one of the greatest records of any female cross-country skier. She grew up in an area near the Ural Mountains called Komi, where she learned to ski in the frigid winters. A decided loner, she grew up as an only child, and remained single throughout her long career, focusing almost exclusively on her skiing. She began skiing in 1967 and was first named to the Soviet national team in 1972. Smetanina first came to international attention at the 1974 World Championships, where she finished third in the 5 km and helped the Soviet relay team to win the gold. This led to her greatest Olympic performance at Innsbruck in 1976. She competed in three events, medaling in all three, with a silver at 5 km, and golds in the 10 km and the relay race. Smetanina competed at the Olympic Winter Games in 1976, 1980, 1984, 1988, and 1992, retiring after the Albertville Olympics. During that time, she won 10 Olympic medals, including four gold. Two of the gold medals came in 1976, and she added another individual gold in the 1980 5 km. Smetanina’s Olympic career ended when she helped the Unified Team women’s relay team to a gold medal at the 1992 Winter Olympics. Her gold medal in the relay came only 12 days before her 40th birthday, making her the oldest female gold medalist in Olympic Winter history. Although, it could be argued that Smetanina celebrated only her 10th birthday after Albertville, because of her birth date of 29 February. Raisa Smetanina also won 13 medals at the World Championships. Of these three were gold medals, including relay titles with the Soviet Union team in 1974 and 1985. Her only individual world title came in the 20 km race in 1982. Smetanina won the World Cup in 1980-81 and silvers at the World Cup in 1978-79 and 1983-84. She also won the 5 km and 10 km at the Holmenkollen Ski Festival and her third Holmenkollen victory came in 5 km in 1979. In 1979 she was awarded also the Holmenkollen medal. In addition to her international triumphs, Smetanina was 21 times Soviet champion and was named an Emeritus Master of Sport of the USSR.

60999,Ella Maillart,Female,20 February 1903,,, Switzerland,SUI,"Ella Maillart was a Swiss travel writer photographer and sportswoman. Maillart was born in 1903 Genève to a wealthy Swiss fur trader and a Danish mother. As a child Maillart read multiple adventure books and enjoyed browsing through maps. Along with her best friend, she took an interest in sailing on Lake Genève. When they were 20, they both sailed from Cannes to Corsica before heading on to Sardinia, Sicily, and Greece. Maillart then competed at the 1924 Paris Olympics in sailing. At the same time Maillart was also captain of the Swiss field hockey team. After the Olympics Maillart participated in the World Championships in Alpine skiing from 1930 to 1934. In the 1930s Maillart began travelling, going to the Caucasus Mountains with some Russian students, returning via Crimea and crossing the Black Sea. The journey was the subject of Maillart’s first book. Maillart’s travels continued with journeys across the Tian Shan mountains of Central Asia and across deserts to avoid Russian checkpoints. After a meeting with British writer Peter Fleming, she asked him the question “How do I get into the Soviet Republic in South China?”. During 1935 the pair of them travelled across China from east to west, a journey that took seven months. Maillart’s next adventure was in 1937 when she returned to Asia, travelling to Afghanistan, Iran, and Turkey. While in Lebanon Maillart wrote another book about her latest travels, which became a bestseller. Two years later Maillart travelled from Genève to Kabul by car accompanied by Swiss writer Annemarie Schwarzenbach. When they arrived in Kabul their trip was curtailed by the outbreak of World War II. Maillart then travelled to Tiruvannamalai in the south of India, spending the duration of the war there before returning to Europe in 1945. In India Maillart wrote another book of her adventures with her cat as her companion. In 1951 Maillart made her first trip to Nepal. She would visit the country more than 40 times up to 1987, where she worked as a guide for tourists. During her lifetime Maillart wrote almost a dozen books about her travels and bequeathed more than 16,000 photographs to the Musée de l’Élysée in Lausanne.",

When he was in the military he was planning to watch a 400 metre race among soldiers, but the colonel forced him to run, and Ferrario immediately proved his worth. Ferrario stood out for the first time at the 1920 Italian Championships in Roma when, at 21, he finished second in the 1,500 metres behind the better known Ernesto Ambrosini. In June 1921 he looked good in a race in Praha, finishing in third place with 4:11.2 behind Vaclav Vohralik, fourth the year before at the Olympics, and the Frenchman André Audinet. In 1922 the Italian best over the 1,500 distance was again Ambrosini with Ferrario second at the Nationals in Busto Arsizio, beaten by Ferruccio Bruni. Ferrario’s best year was 1923. He ran four times below the Italian record, and on 6 June in Paris beat Emilio Lunghi’s mark set at the 1908 London Olympics. On 11 July in København he set the Italian record for 2,000 metres (5:37.0), then in Berlin he defeated Otto Peltzer, and finally in Wien (Vienna) in September he was beaten by six metres by the Swiss Willy Scharer, who would win silver at the 1924 Paris Olympics. Internationally Ferrario won three caps but failed to survive the heats in Paris. Ferrario won three consecutive Italian titles at 1,500 m (1923-25), always with the team shirt of Milano’s Gruppo Sportivo Officine Meccaniche.

69100,Eric Hall,Male,15 September 1932,183.0,64, Great Britain,GBR,"Eric Hall attended the Tiffin Grammar School, Kingston, where he participated in both cross-country and cricket, but with little success. His eventual career as a race walker stemmed from regular family weekend rambles and he soon found he was timing himself on walks from his home to his grandmother’s house. This came to the attention of his father, and he suggested he joined some of his colleagues at London Transport, who were keen competitive walkers. Eventually, Hall joined Belgrave Harriers as a 16-year-old in November 1948, having been bitten by the competitiveness of athletics, thanks to that year’s London Olympics. That would be the start of a 73-year relationship with the Harriers. Shortly after leaving school, Hall passed the Civil Service entrance examination and he joined the Customs and Excise Office. Allen won the first of nine Surrey County Road Walking titles (at two, seven, and ten miles) in 1955. That same year Stan Vickers also joined the Belgrave club, and was emerging as a great walking prospect, and the pair motivated each other and brought out the best of each other and Hall finished third in the 1955 National Road Walking 20 Miles Championship. After finishing second to Don Thompson in the National 50km in 1956, Hall was selected for that distance in Melbourne. Unfortunately, the Olympic race was run in very hot and humid conditions which did not suit the British walkers, and Thompson ended up in hospital for three days. The year after the Olympics, Hall won the National 20 miles title by beating George Chaplin (Coventry Godiva Harriers), and Albert Johnson (Sheffield United Harriers) into second and third place respectively. After making his international début for Great Britain against Switzerland at Lugano in 1959, a second Olympic appearance followed for Hall at Roma in 1960 and, while conditions this time were again warm, they suited the British contingent better than at Melbourne four years earlier. In the 20 km, Hall finished 10th while his friend Vickers won bronze, and this time Thompson ended up with gold in the 50 km race. Despite his career nearing its end, largely because his job took him away from London, Hall still took part in the 50 km trials for the 1964 Tokyo Olympics but missed out on selection after finishing fifth. Despite his job taking him around the country, Hall still supported Belgrave Harriers and walked in veteran events whenever he could. A life member since 1957, Hall was made president of the Club in 1999. Over the years he obtained many degrees after studying at the Open University. He served as treasurer of the British Olympians Society and had a large collection of athletics memorabilia. Personal Bests: 20kmW – 1-33:37 (1959); 50kmW – 4-31:41 (1956).",

Sailing out of Liverpool, their ships traded with Spanish colonies, and the United States. Rupert, who served as a lieutenant-colonel in the Army in the years shortly after World War II, went on to become a very good skier and was, in 1954 and 1956, the captain of the British Ski Team, although he did not compete in the Cortina d’Ampezzo Olympics. His best year was probably 1952, when he won the Scottish Ski Club’s Kandahar Cup in the Cairngorms. He also finished fifth overall in the British Championships, third in the combined and downhill at the Lowlanders’ Championship, and competed at the Olympic Games. De Larringa never won a British title but finished third in the slalom at St. Moritz in 1953. He tried his hand at motor sport in the 1950s, taking part in his Allard in sprints and hill climbs, and was a winner of the famous Shelsley Walsh International Hill Climb. De Larrinaga, who served as a director of the family shipping business, later lived on the Isle of Man, and in 1994 the island honored him by producing a postage stamp bearing his portrait, in commemoration of the centenary of the IOC. Two ships in the Larrinaga fleet bore the name Rupert de Larrinaga. The first, built in 1930, was torpedoed during World War II.

After the Olympics, Ojanperä won the C-1 1,000 m title, adding C-1 10K and relay silvers at the 1953 Nordic Championships.

Vonn competed at four Winter Olympics, missing the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics because of a knee ligament injury. She won three Olympic medals with a gold in the 2010 downhill, and bronzes in the 2018 downhill and 2010 Super-G. Vonn was dominant on the World Cup circuit, and finished her career with 82 World Cup victories, the most ever by a woman (later surpassed by Mikaela Shiffrin), and second at the time only to Sweden’s Ingemar Stenmark. She was one of only six women (at the time) to win World Cup races in all five disciplines – downhill, Super-G, giant slalom, slalom, and combined. Overall, Vonn had 137 World Cup podiums. She won eight World Cup season titles in the downhill (2008-13, 2015-16), five titles in the Super-G (2009-12, 2015), and three consecutive titles in the combined from 2010-12. Vonn was a four-time winner of the overall World Cup title, in 2008-10 and 2012. Her 20 World Cup crystal globes surpassed Stenmark, who had won 19 season titles. Vonn won eight medals at the World Championships, with gold medals in downhill and Super-G in 2009. She added silvers in both events in 2007 and another silver in the 2011 downhill. She won lone bronze medals at the 2013, 2015, and 2017 Worlds, in Super-G in 2013 and downhill in 2015 and 2017. Vonn achieved all this despite multiple knee injuries during her career that required several reconstructive surgeries. Notably, this likely caused her Olympic record to be less than her dominance in other events as she was often recovering from surgery or missing the 2014 Games. Vonn was married to US ski team member Thomas Vonn, although they later divorced. She later had well-publicized celebrity relationships with Tiger Woods and hockey player P. K. Subban.

He was educated at Cardinal Vaughan Memorial School and studied at the University of London already playing in the midfield of the University team. Later he joined Casuals FC London to become club captain, leading them to victory in the 1936 FA Amateur Cup final. Parallel to his time with Casuals he had guest appearances for various other teams like Southend United (1931-33), Fulham FC (1933-34) and FC Arsenal (since May 1935). He played 10 games for England’s Amateur Team and captained the British team at the 1936 Olympic football tournament. There, he played both games against China and Poland as Centre half, scoring two goals against Poland even though he never scored a goal in his games for Arsenal’s first eleven. In 1936 he earned a full international cap for England playing Belgium. Joy went on the England amateur tour of New Zealand, Australia and Ceylon (now Sri Lanka) in 1937. Disregarding the unofficial wartime games, he was the last amateur player to officially represent England. He was still registered as a Casuals player and is recorded in the England history books as playing for them at the time, not Arsenal.

48581,Ezio Selva,Male,20 March 1902,,, Italy,ITA,"Ezio Selva was an Italian powerboat ace and wire manufacturer who was among the greatest in his field, with Mario Verga, during the 1950s. Selva began his sporting career with diving: at 20 he was the Italian platform champion, at 25 he won bronze in the 10 meters platform event at the 1927 Bologna European Championships (finishing by behind the Germans Hans Luber, gold, and Ewald Riebschläger, silver) and in 1928 he participated at the Olympic Games in Amsterdam. He made his début in motorboating in 1950, winning the Milano-Abbiategrasso at a record average of 117.300 km/hr. In the inboard motorboat 2800 C. inches Selva dominated the early 50s in Europe, winning three Italian titles and three European titles in the same years (1951-52, 1954). In Milano, in 1951, Selva set a class record with 168.260 km/hr while in Campione d’Italia and, on Lake Lugano the following year, set the record of the 800-Kilogram class to 194.736 km/hr. He earned another record - that APBA on the mile of the 800-Kg class - by winning his first American race in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, the Governor’s Cup of 1955, at an average of 228.145 km/hr, equal to 141.767 miles. He was thus admitted to the 100-mile club, reserved in the United States for those who manage to reach this hourly average. For two consecutive years (1956-57) he won the world title of the 800-kilogram inboard, and in 1957 he also won the European title of the 500-Kilogram inboard and the Italian title of the 2500 C. inches inboard. Selva decided that the Orange Bowl Regatta’s Grand Prix in Miami Beach, where he was riding his boat Moschettiere, would be the last race of his career, but the 55-year-old Italian was killed while in command, in an accident 500 meters from the finish, on 29 December 1957. In the second heat of this event his power boat flipped at 100 miles an hour and he was crushed near the judges’ stand and in full view of 10,000 spectators, and his 20-year-old son Luciano, who was attending the race. HIs red Alfa-Romeo powered hydro suddenly nosed skyward and danced briefly on its stern, then dove forward, rolled on its side and knifed bow-first into choppy Biscayne Bay. Luciano plunged off a seawall to swim to his father’s aid. A Miami beach fireman jumped off a boat and recovered Selva’s floating body.

Nelson attended high school at The Lovett School in Atlanta and then went to Dartmouth College where he threw the shot and played football. In 1993 he was the first freshman to play football for Dartmouth as that was the first year the Ivy League allowed freshman to play varsity football. Nelson won the 1997 NCAA title in the shot put. Internationally Nelson appeared at six consecutive World Championships from 2003-11, winning the title in 2005 and getting silver medals in 2003 and 2007. He also won the 2001 Goodwill Games, the 2005 World Athletics Final, and the 1994 World Junior Championships. At the 2004 Olympics the shot put competition was held at Ancient Olympia. Nelson and Ukraine’s Yuriy Bilonog tied with the best mark of 21.16 metres. Nelson had only one fair throw, although he had a long foul on his sixth that he protested vociferously. Because Bilonog had other fair throws, he won the gold medal initially on tie breaker rules. In 2012 when WADA was re-testing samples from earlier Olympics, Bilonog’s sample came back positive for an oxandrolone metabolite, an anabolic steroid, and he was disqualified. After appeals, the disqualification became official in May 2013 and Nelson later received his gold medal at a food court in the Atlanta airport – nine years after the competition ended. Nelson and his family settled in Houston where they helped raise over $12 million for pediatric cancer research and treatment. In 2020 they returned to his roots when he was named the athletic director at The Lovett School.

He later became one of the great distance runners of all-time, especially measured against the clock, but one who struggled to win on the biggest stages. Between 1963-68 Clarke set 17 world records, over distances ranging from 2 miles to the one-hour race. In 1965, he was at his best, setting 11 world records that year alone. His most famous record occurred on 14 July 1965 at Bislett Stadium in Oslo, when Clarke recorded 27:39.4 (27:39.89) for 10,000 metres, breaking his own listed record of 28:15.6, shattering the previous best by over 36 seconds. At the Commonwealth Games Clarke won four silver medals, in the 1962 3-miles, the 1966 3- and 6-mile races, and the 1970 10,000 metres. Favored for golds at the 1964 Olympics in the distances, he came away only with a bronze in the 1964 10,000 metres. At Mexico City in 1968, Clarke ran himself to exhaustion in the thin air of the Mexican capital, and lay prostrate on the track at the end of the 10,000, after finishing sixth. After the 1968 Olympics, Clarke visited Czechoslovakia to meet his predecessor as the world’s greatest distance runner, Emil Zátopek. When he left for Australia, Zatopek gave him a present to be opened only on the plane, and it was one of his gold medals, with a note saying, “Because you deserve it”. Clarke later became mayor of Gold Coast, Queensland in 2004, serving until 2012, when he resigned to run in the Queensland state elections, but he was badly beaten in that election. Clarke was made a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in 1966. In 2013 he was appointed an Officer of the Order of Australia (AO) on the Queens Birthday Honours List.

921015,Yoshikazu Uchida,Male,23 February 1885,,, Japan,JPN,"Japanese architect and structural engineer Yoshikazu Uchida studied at the Department of Architecture of the Tokyo Imperial University, graduating in 1907. He became university lecturer in 1911, after working for the real estate division of Mitsubishi for some years. In 1921, he was appointed a professor and in 1935 became president of the Architectural Institute of Japan. Uchida was named University president in 1943. After World War II, he was a member of a cultural heritage protection committee and recipient of the Order of Culture in 1972. At the beginning of his academic career, knowledge of steel and reinforced concrete structures came to Japan. In his country, he was a pioneer in research on materials, which enhanced water protection and isolation from seismic ground movement and allowed the building of modern urban architectural foundations. Moreover, he was involved in the implementation of a new city planning law that brought major improvements regarding the containment of city fires. Later, he also campaigned for the protection of the cultural heritage. Uchida is best remembered for the buildings he designed on the University of Tokyo campus, which he rebuilt after the Great Kanto earthquake in 1923. He developed the general layout for the reconstruction of the campus of Tokyo University and was also the designer of the Yasuda Auditorium and Library with the row of Gingko trees. With the assistance of younger colleagues and students in the Department of Architecture, Uchida designed some 30 buildings in a distinctive style known as “Uchida Gothic.” The massive towers and pointed arches of this style recall the Gothic revival architecture of universities in the United States and Europe, but its overall abstract quality also suggested an Expressionist influence. The pool, whose plans were exhibited at the Berlin art competitions in 1936, is located in the basement of The Second Dining Hall, which was designed by Uchida and completed in 1934 and is still in use today. In the next year, the University of Tokyo archery field, his second submitted design, was constructed with a Japanese-style hall in the Ikutokuen Park. Uchida was also a member of the organizing committee for the art competitions of the planned 1940 Olympic Games in Tokyo.",

After podium spots in the 1973 and 1974 European Championships, Van Helden lived up to his potential in 1976. That year, he broke two World Records (1,500 m and 5,000 m), won three Olympic bronze medals, placed third at the World Allround Championships, fourth at the World Sprint Championships (after two 1,000 m wins), won the Dutch Allround title, and became number one on the Adelskalender, the all-time combined points ranking. Despite this, Van Helden was rather disappointed with his Olympic results, citing unfortunate draws and weather circumstances. The following years, Van Helden struggled making the Dutch team and after failing to qualify for the 1980 Games, he decided to skate for France, having gained citizenship following his marriage to Marie-France Vives. As a Frenchman, he qualified for the 1984 and 1988 Olympics, and his fourth place in the Sarajevo 1,500 m was the best result by a Dutch-born skater at these Olympics. He didn’t approach his former results, but had occasional successes, winning the 1,500 m at the 1984 European Championships and taking a bronze in the 10,000 m at his final World Championships in 1988. With the 1992 Winter Olympics held in France, Van Helden attempted a comeback at age 43.

With the CAA he held the position of right winger for the team that dominated the league for three consecutive years. In July 1930 Cao was suspended following allegations of professionalism. Due to public pressure, however, the suspension was lifted in February 1931. In 1932 he went to Surabaya to support the development of football in the Dutch East Indies. Due to the lack of capable players, he was called back to Hong Kong, but had to retire due to illness until 1934. After his comeback he was transferred to the SCAA, where he played with some interruptions until the end of the 1930s. Cao was selected for the national team for the first time for the 1927 Far Eastern Games, when he was only 16 years old.
