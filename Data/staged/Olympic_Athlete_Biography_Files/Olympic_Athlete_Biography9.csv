It brought him to the 1996 Atlanta Olympics as a gold medal favorite but he lost there in the semi-finals to the Kazakh Vasily Zhirov and settled for a bronze medal. Shortly after the Olympics, Tarver turned pro and had his first professional fight in February 1997, knocking out Joaquin García in the second round. This was a prelude to an almost 20-year career in which he won light-heavyweight and cruiserweight world titles under multiple organizations, including the WBA, WBC, IBF, and The Ring magazine titles, in addition to the IBO light heavyweight and cruiserweight titles. In 2003 and 2004 Tarver fought several well-publicized bouts with former Olympian Roy Jones, Jr., losing the first fight by majority decision for the WBC light-heavyweight belt, but winning the re-match in a second-round knockout, to regain the WBC title and annex the WBA light-heavyweight crown. In 2005, Tarver won the rubber match by unanimous decision. In 2004-05 Tarver also had two bally-hooed fights against IBF light-heavyweight champion Glen Johnson, although Johnson had been recently stripped of that title. Tarver lost by split decision in December 2004, but came back six months later to avenge that loss. Tarver’s other big bouts included a loss to Bernard Hopkins in June 2006, and two heavily promoted fights in 2008-09 in which Tarver lost both times to Chad Dawson. Tarver was, by then, in the twilight of his career. Tarver fought through 2011, although he had sporadic absences from the ring in the later 2000s, finishing with a professional record of 31 wins (22 by KO), 6 losses, and 1 draw. Even while still fighting Tarver starred in the Rocky Balboa movie as Mason “The Line” Dixon. Near the end of his career, he had two controversial episodes of positive drug tests. After retiring Tarver spent some time as a boxing commentator for the US Showtime network on television.",Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the Summer Pan American Games (1–0–0 1995 Mar del Plata BOX gold: light-heavyweight -81 kg) Listed in Olympic Boxers Who Won a Professional World Championship (Olympics - 1996 Light-Heavyweight (Bronze); Professional World Champion - IBF Light-Heavyweight (2003-2003); IBF Light-Heavyweight (2008-2008); WBA Light-Heavyweight (2004-2004); WBC Light-Heavyweight (2003-2003); WBC Light-Heavyweight (2004-2004).)

She had previously played with Team Quebec at the 1999 Canada Winter Games, winning a silver medal, but did not make the Canadian Women’s National Team as a starter until 2005.

He was denied a chance for an unprecedented third Olympic title by the Eastern Bloc boycott of the 1984 Summer Olympics.

68934,Guy Butler,Male,25 August 1899,188.0,80, Great Britain,GBR,"Guy Butler enjoyed a distinguished Harrovian and sporting pedigree. His grandfather had been Headmaster of the school at the age of 26 and his father, also a Harrovian, won a cricket and athletics blue at Cambridge and was the English rackets champion in 1889. After winning three events at the 1917 Public School sports, Guy Butler left Harrow and spent a year at the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, before entering Trinity College, Cambridge. In 1919 he won the AAA 440 yards title at his first attempt and although he was to establish himself as Britain’s leading quarter-miler, surprisingly he never won this event again. After dead-heating with Bevil Rudd in the 1920 Oxford vs. Cambridge match, Butler finished second to the South African in both the AAA Championships and Olympic final, but he won an Olympic gold medal as anchor man on the relay team. Between 1920 and the 1924 Olympic Games, Butler won the 440 yards against Oxford in 1921 and 1922 and finished second at the 1922 and 1923 AAA Championships. Although a muscle injury forced him to use standing starts, he was in fine form at the 1924 Olympics. After setting a European record of 48.0 seconds in the semi-final of the 400 metres he was third in the final and won a second bronze medal in the relay. Following a mediocre 1925 season, Butler reported to form in 1925. He was enjoying excellent training facilities as a teacher at Lancing College and after equaling the world 300 yard record of 30.6 seconds in June, he then won the AAA 220 yards title. In 1928 he became the first British track & field athlete to compete in three Olympic Games but after failing to reach the semi-finals of the 200 metres in Amsterdam he tired at the end of the season. Guy Butler was unlucky in that he was perhaps never quite at his best in Olympic years but with one gold, one silver, and two bronze medals he was one of the most successful of all British Olympic athletes. After his retirement, Butler coached some notable athletes and made a significant contribution to the techniques of filming them in action. He was also one of the advisors on the design of the White City Stadium and served as the athletics correspondent of the Morning Post until it was merged with the Daily Telegraph in 1937.

He qualified to represent Canada in the coxless pairs, but lost his partner, Donald Pretty, when Pretty was transferred to the coxed eights to replace George Hungerford, who had come down with mononucleosis. Despite Hungerford never having competed in the pairs, he joined Jackson and trained hard, hoping to make an impact at the 1964 Games. Their first race together was the opening round of the Olympics and they managed not only to qualify, but to do so in the fastest time. In the final they defeated favorites Steven Blaisse and Ernst Veenemans of the Netherlands to win the gold medal, Canada’s only one of the tournament. For their achievement they were jointly awarded the Lou Marsh Trophy as the nation’s top athletes of the year.

He later received a scholarship allowing him to enroll in the Tokyo Higher Normal School in 1910. The following year, Kanaguri participated in the marathon trials for the Stockholm Olympics, setting what was claimed a world best of 2-32:45 over a distance of 25 miles (= 40.225 km). Together with sprinter Yahiko Mishima, he qualified to become the first Japanese Olympian. Kanakuri had a difficult 18-day long trip to reach Stockholm for the 1912 Olympics. After travelling by ship and Trans-Siberian-Railway he had to rest for five days to be able to run the marathon. After 30 km of the Olympic marathon, suffering from the heat, he stopped at a house and asked the residents for a glass of water. The residents gave him water, and he lay down on a couch and fell asleep, awakening the next morning. Ashamed of his actions, he at first refused to return to Japan. In 1967 he returned to Stockholm at the age of 76 and finished his marathon run. Therefore, he has the “slowest” finishing time ever in an Olympic marathon with 54 years, 8 months, 6 days, 32 minutes and 20.3 seconds, a record surely not to be broken. After returning to Japan, he started to adapt his training methods, including high-altitude training and what he called “heat resistance practice”. He also encouraged other youngsters to start long-distance running and shared with them his experiences. Two years after the Stockholm Olympics, he improved his time for the 25 miles to 2-19:20.3. This made him one of the favorites for the 1916 Berlin Olympics, which had to be canceled due to the outbreak of World War I. He went on to take part in the 1920 and 1924 Olympics. At Antwerpen, while he was still well up in the field close to the 40 km mark, he eventually hurt his legs and finished 16th. In Paris, he abandoned the race at approximately 32 km. From 1917 on, he also entered long-distance walking and running relays, including the first prestigious Tokyo-Hakone Round-Trip College Ekiden Race (Hakone Ekiden). He also contributed greatly to the technical development of running shoes in Japan. Working as a teacher at various schools, he promoted women’s physical education, organizing the first women’s tennis tournament and forming the Kanto Women’s Sports Federation. In the 1930s, Kanakuri further pursued his activities to promote the marathon and was involved in preparing the first Olympic Games in Japan, which eventually had to be returned. In 1945, he returned to his hometown Tamana to spent the rest of his life there. There, he became the first chairman of the Kumamoto Athletic Association and the Kumamoto Prefectural Chairman of Education and organized international marathons in Japan. He remained physically active until an old age and was called the “Father of Marathon in Japan”. Personal Best: Mar – 2-36:09 (1924).",

Anti-Semitism and politics in his home country, however, limited his opportunities to compete internationally so, in 1965, he moved to Israel and began competing for their national team. His first appearance for them came at the 1965 Maccabiah Games, where he took bronze in the rifle three positions and prone events.

He was regarded by many as one of the most significant modern Japanese artists of the 20th century. His art work consisted of oil and ink paintings, prints, ceramics and calligraphy. Munakata aspired to become an oil painter after seeing a Van Gogh sunflower painting on a magazine cover. He later organized a “Western-style” painting group with three former middle-school classmates from Aomori. Munakata first gained international acclaim through his woodcut prints. Munakata was born into a poor blacksmith’s family and, therefore, had only a basic education. In 1924, he moved to Tokyo in order to become a professional painter. Due to lack of money he had to take humble jobs and his works were rejected by the official Bunten Exhibition. When he was finally accepted in 1928 his main interest had switched from oil painting to woodcutting and printing. He learned the technique from Sosaku Hanga printmaker Hiratsuka Unichi and was immediately successful. His prints were accepted for the Shun’yō-kai as well as for the Kokugakai Exhibitions. In 1935, he became associated with the Japanese Mingei (folk art) movement. During a visit to Kyoto, Munakata was significantly influenced by Buddhist religious art. During the bombing of Tokyo in May 1945, his house and most of his woodblocks were destroyed and subsequently he was evacuated to Fukumitsu, Toyama prefecture until 1951. After World War II, Munakata continued to produce numerous woodblock prints, paintings in watercolor and oil, calligraphy, and illustrated books. He moved into a new studio in Kamakura, Kanagawa prefecture and traveled to the United States and Europe in the 1950s. He received awards in Lugano, Switzerland (1952), São Paulo, Brazil (1955) and at the Venice Biennale in 1956. At home, the Japanese government presented him with the Order of Culture in 1970.

He was a product of Jaume Ferrer’s Gimnasio Baleares and in 1948 Jim Oliver became the first Mallorcan boxer to compete at the Olympics. His Olympic career was brief, lasting less than two rounds of his only contest. He turned professional after the Games, but that new career was also brief, and without success, so he turned to wrestling and in 1951, after only one year in his new sport, he beat Jose “Iron Man” Tarres in Barcelona to become the European mid-heavyweight champion. He didn’t have the best of temperaments and in 1952 he attacked a referee which resulted in the official receiving six broken teeth. Oliver was banned from wrestling in Spain for a year but continued fighting in Europe, mostly in London and Paris. He eventually retired in 1964 and became a successful entrepreneur, businessman and aviator. He also had acting roles in movies that featured wrestling. His brother Toni was also a wrestler and was at one time the European light-heavyweight champion. In 2016 Youba Sissokho became only the second Mallorcan boxer to qualify for the Olympic Games.",

Harald Bohr and his brother were very close, throughout their lives. Early in his career, it was thought that Harald would become the more famous scientist but his career was eclipsed by that of Niels Bohr, one of the most famous physicists of the 20th century. At the University of Købnhaven, the annual award for outstanding teaching is named in Harald Bohr’s honor. Bohr worked on Dirichlet series, and applied analysis to the theory of numbers. He collaborated with Edmund Landau, to prove the Bohr-Landau theorem on the distribution of zeros of the Riemann zeta function, showing that all but an infinitesimal proportion of the zeros of the zeta function lie in a small neighborhood of the line s = 1/2. Between 1923-26 Bohr developed the theory of almost periodic functions, and developed a result on the uniform approximation to almost periodic functions by exponential functions. As a footballer he played with the Akademisk Boldklub, beginning in 1903. He played through the 1908 Olympics, and played one further international with the Danish side in 1910 against England.","Uncle of Ernest Bohr Listed in Olympians With Nobel Prizes or Related to Nobel Prize Winners (A top mathematician in his own right, Harald Bohr’s brother was Niels Bohr, the renowned physicist, who won the 1922 Nobel Prize in Physics.)"

After placing second to Randy Matson at the 1968 Olympics he was desperately unlucky not to win the gold medal at München. Woods’ final trial at the 1972 Games would almost certainly have exceeded Władysław Komar’s winning mark – albeit marginally – but the shot hit Komar’s measuring peg and Woods lost the Olympic title by a mere centimeter Woods made a third Olympic appearance in 1976 when he placed seventh. He tried for a fourth team in 1980, but placed only eleventh at the Final Trials. Woods had a career best of 72-2¾ (22.02) in 1974 which bettered the current world record, but because it was indoors at the Los Angeles Times Games, it did not receive official approval. Personal Bests: SP – 72-2¾i (22.02i) (1974); DT – 181-6 (55.32) (1968).",

He competed for the University of Iowa and briefly at West Point. Coulter made the 1924 Olympic team by finishing third at the Final Trials. He was also fourth that year at the AAU Meet. Coulter later became an insurance salesman in Pittsburgh for one year before moving back to Ohio, where he sold insurance and coached track at Case Western Reserve. Coulter had trained in ROTC (Reserve Officer Training Corps) in college and in Ohio, he served the Ohio National Guard 37th Division. The Division was called to active duty in 1940, with Coulter as division commander. He trained at Camp Shelby, Mississippi and then served in the South Pacific in 1942. After the war he continued in the Reserves as Commanding Officer of the 410th Infantry Regiment, retiring in 1965 as a colonel. In the 1950s and 60s Coulter lived in Iowa where he worked as a farmer.

921773,Richard Scheibe,Male,19 April 1879,,, Germany,GER,"German Richard Scheibe studied painting in Dresden and München, but then turned to sculpture. From 1904 he lived in Berlin, and from 1908 in a studio community with Gerhard Marcks. In 1914 he joined the Berlin Secession, known from 1916 as the Free Secession. From 1925-34 he was a professor at the Städel Art Institute in Frankfurt am Main. As a sculptor, initially he was close to Georg Kolbe and cooperated with Bauhaus artists. In 1934 Scheibe moved to the Academy of Fine Arts in Berlin and headed from 1936 the master studio for sculpture of the Academy. In the Nazi era, he received numerous awards and was exempted from military service. In 1944 Scheibe was awarded the Goethe Medal for Art and Science, and was inducted by Adolf Hitler into the “Gottbegnadeten List” (List of Divinely Gifted) of the most important visual artists. After World War II, he was reinstated as a professor at the Academy of Fine Arts. In 1953 he created the memorial for the victims of 20 July 1944 in the Bendler Block in Berlin in honor of the failed Hitler assassination. Scheibe mainly produced figurative statues and sculptures. The concrete relief Der Schwimmer (The Swimmer) created by Scheibe in the format 62.5 x 167 cm, which was originally part of a fountain design from 1923, is mounted on a wall of the Georg-Kolbe-Museum. In 1925, Scheibe used the motif again for a bronze plaque that served as the winner’s medal for a swimming festival in Frankfurt/Main. In Helsinki in 1952, Scheibe exhibited a 2.18 m high bronze figure, 24 years after his participation in 1928 with medals and reliefs. In the Official Report it is listed as a Runner. Proved by picture comparisons and contemporary sources it is actually the figure Schreitender (Strider) from 1952, a title that seems much more appropriate. In 1954 the work was acquired by the city of Köln (Cologne). It was last placed in the Rhine Park in Deutz district. From there, the sculpture was stolen in 2017 and has not yet reappeared. Casting molds apparently no longer exist. In Berlin there is a sculpture of the same name and slightly modified by Richard Scheibe, located in the Park at Karlsbad in Tiergarten. This was already created in 1935, however.",

Noel’s early love of mountains came when he spent one and a half years at school in Switzerland, and he then gained his Himalayan experience as a subaltern in the East Yorkshire Regiment, when he was based in Calcutta.

She also attended pedagogical and arts and crafts workshops, and later played a significant role in the development of professional industrial design in Poland. In 1939, she was planning to establish an “employment agency for necessary artists in the industrial sector”, but the war prevented this, and during World War II, all of her previous works were destroyed. During the German occupation, she worked as a teacher, but also provided shelter for jeopardized representatives of culture and science in Poland. After the war, she devoted herself to writing and organizing as the director of the Institute of Applied Arts, and in 1950 established the Institute of Industrial Design in Warszawa. As a vice-president and artistic director, Telakowska highly influenced the institute’s work up to the 1970s. After the 1968 Polish political crisis, she had to resign from her post and was transferred to the Studio of Environmental Artistic Inventions of the institute. Due to the increasing loss of eyesight, she was forced to retire in 1978. Telakowska’s woodcuts and paintings mainly showed landscapes. Three of her color woodcuts were selected to represent Poland in the 1936 art competitions: Camping (1934, 20 x 16.5 cm), Postój (Break, 1934, format 14 x 11.5 cm) and Sport i przyroda (Sport and Nature, also known as Kajaki, 1932). In Polish sources, instead of the latter, Przystań (Harbor) was listed in the size of 20 x 16.5 cm. An oversized copy of Kajaki today adorns the wall of an apartment building in Warszawa.

His next move took him to the north-east in 1902, when he played for Newcastle. A further move in 1906 took him back to the London area where he teamed up with the London Amateur and Barking Swimming Clubs. He won many representative honours, playing for both Surrey and Middlesex, and also represented both the North and the South. Kemp also won two England caps, both against Ireland, in 1900 and 1902. At the 1900 Paris Olympics, on the same day that he won a water polo gold medal, Kemp entered the obstacle race held in the River Seine. In this highly unusual event, competitors had to climb over a pole then scramble over one row of boats before finally swimming under another.

When he was 21-years-old Diéguez finished in third place in the 10,000 metres at the 1923 Paris International Meeting. His talents were spotted by Barcelona Football Club, who signed him to their athletics team with the aim to qualify for the 1924 Paris Olympics. In March 1924 Diéguez took part in an exhibition race during the half-time of a football match between Barcelona and Terrassa where he unofficially equalled the Spanish record in the 3,000 metres. Later the same month Diéguez ran in his first 10,000 metres race in Spain where he broke the national record. In April 1924 he went on to better his own Spanish record in a race in Zaragoza. A month later the Royal Spanish Athletic Federation named Diéguez in their provisional list of athletes for the Paris Olympics. He then won the 10,000 metres title at the Spanish Athletics Championship, again setting a national record, with the time standing until 1928. While Diéguez was a 10,000 metres specialist, it is unclear if he ran in his favoured event at the 1924 Paris Olympics. The 1924 Official Report implies that there were 43 starters, but this number is felt to be wrong, with the number likely to be somewhere between 30 and 35 runners. Some Spanish sources list Diéguez as finishing the race, while other reports do not show him as competing. He was listed as a competitor in the 5,000 metres but he did not start the race. Diéguez did run in the 3,000 metres cross-country race, however, but did not finish. The top-three individual placements counted towards the overall standings in the team cross-country results, but only two Spanish athletes completed the course. After the Olympics Diéguez opted to remain in France, living in Marseille where he married a French woman and opened a butcher’s shop in 1925. During the rest of the decade he won multiple distance races around the country, before becoming a French citizen in 1930. The same year he ran in the Ten Nations Cross Country Championship held in England, winning the bronze medal. In 1932 Diéguez won the Southeast French Cross Country Championships and the Cross Chazelle, the last known races that he competed in.

Between 1918 and 1926, Tammer won 24 Estonian track & field titles in the shot put (1918-26), hammer throw (1923-26), and discus throw (1919-21).

67078,George Fahoum,Male,4 July 1909,,, Egypt,EGY,"George Fahoum was born in Egypt but attended school in Lebanon, eventually matriculating at the American University in Beirut. There he was athletically active, particularly in tennis and track and field athletics, and set several collegiate records. He then returned to his home country and joined the national athletics team after coming in second in the 400 metres at the 1933 Egyptian Championships. His biggest international moment came at the 1936 Berlin Olympics, where he was eliminated in round one of both the 100 and 200 metres. He continued to compete for the rest of the decade and was Egyptian champion in the 100 metres in 1937 (with a national record time of 10.8 seconds) and runner-up in 1939. That same year, Fahoum married Emma Mirshak, who was also well-known in Egypt as a track athlete. He then entered into business with Emma’s father, Elias, and made millions importing heavy agricultural equipment. After the Egyptian Revolution of 1952, however, Fahoum gradually fell out of favour with the new regime.

His family name was changed early to Roda (Croatian for stork) in order to get rid of the Jewish name Rosenfeld. As a teenager, together with his sister Marie (1875-1935), he wrote novels published under the double name Roda Roda. In 1900, his first works appeared in the Simplicissimus. Roda Roda first studied law at the University of Vienna (Wien), but then served in the military for 12 years, beginning in 1893, leaving the service due to several disciplinary problems. His trademark for decades was a red tailored vest made from a red skirt lining, which he wore in almost all his numerous cabaret appearances. In World War I, Roda Roda worked as a war correspondent, but he later wrote cabaret pieces. In the Nazi dictatorship he sympathized with Carl von Ossietzky (1889-1938), which is why he emigrated to Switzerland after Hitler came to power. In 1940 Roda Roda was asked to leave the country and he moved to the US, where he died from leukemia in 1945. The novella Polo is a love story from the milieu of polo sports. It first appeared in 1939 in 17 episodes in the “Pariser Tageszeitung”, a daily edited by emigres in Paris. As a book, it first appeared in 1980.",

He won two Copa del Rey titles in 1913 and 1918 and was also a member of the Campeonato Regional del Norte (North Championship) winning team in 1918, as well as a member of three Campeonato Regional de Guipúzcoa winning teams (1920-22). At the end of 1922, during a game against FC Barcelona, he was involved in a brawl with player Salvador Martinez Surroca leading to a one-year suspension for Patricio and a fine of 500 pesetas. Since he was almost 30-years-old, he retired. At the 1920 Olympics, where he was in the line-up of the first-ever match played by the Spanish national team, Patricio played in four of the five matches and scored the winning goal against Denmark, which was also the first-ever goal for the Spanish national team. In total he earned five caps between 1920 and 1921, but the goal at the Olympics was his only one. His brother Ignacio was also a footballer. Patrico first worked as a brick mason, then owned a hardware store and also worked as a physical education teacher. He died of pneumonia in 1935 six days before his 42nd birthday. From 1953-68 the newspapers Marca and Arriba awarded the Trofeo Patricio Arabolaza to the Spanish league player who best represents the spirit of “La furia española,” a nickname the team earned during the 1920 Games.

He twice won the World Military Championships (1955-56), and also won the gold medal at the 1955 Mediterranean Games in Barcelona. The following year, at the Melbourne Olympics, he was beaten by Vladimir Stolnikov of the Soviet Union in the second round. Burruni turned professional in 1957 and had his first bout a week before his 24th birthday, relatively late for a boxer to join the paid ranks. Within 18 months, however, he had won the Italian flyweight title. He also won the European flyweight title in 1961 and, in 1965, got his first chance at a world title and took it by beating Thailand’s Pone Kingpetch, with a unanimous points decision over 15 rounds. The WBA and WBC then stripped Burruni of his title, but he travelled to Australia in December 1965 to beat Rocky Gattellari for a version of the title. Burruni would lose this title to Britain’s Walter McGowan the following year after another 15-round contest, but Burruni was 33-years-of-age at the time. Struggling to make the weight, Burruni moved up to bantamweight, and added another European crown, after beating the champion Mimoum Ben Ali in 1968. Burruni’s last fight was in April 1969, when he beat Pierre Vetroff to retain his European title. Burruni announced his retirement on 24 July 1969, having won 99 of his 109 fights, 32 by knockout. He retired to the village Santa Maria la Palma near his birthplace at Alghero, where he died in 2004.

Wallace got his start in rowing at Hamilton, Ontario’s Leander Boat Club in 1983, inspired to join the sport by compatriot Mel LaForme. His first major international tournament was the 1985 World Championships, where he placed tenth in the eights, but he improved his performance to seventh in the coxed fours and fifth in the eights at the 1986 and 1987 editions respectively. He also reached the finals of the coxed fours at the 1986 Commonwealth Games, but did not medal. After finishing sixth in the eights at the 1988 Summer Olympics, he took a year off from major international tournaments, but came back strong at the 1990 World Championships by winning silver in the eights alongside Darren Barber, Andy Crosby, Robert Marland, Terry Paul, Derek Porter, Michael Rascher, Bruce Robertson, and Brian Saunderson. He repeated the feat in 1991, with Don Telfer substituting for Saunderson, and then went on to the 1992 Summer Olympics, where the crew, with Michael Forgeron in place of Tefler, won the gold medal and set an Olympic record. Wallace retired shortly after the Games and later took up the triathlon to remain athletically active.",Husband (divorced) of Silken Laumann Brother-in-law of Danièle Laumann

He founded the North Pacific Lawn Tennis Association in 1904 and a year later won a major tennis championship in Scotland that brought him to national prominence. Several years later he captained Canada’s tennis delegation to the 1908 Summer Olympics, where he placed joint-ninth in the singles competition and, alongside James Foulkes, joint-seventh in the doubles tournament. He also helped represent Canada at the 1913 Davis Cup (then known as the International Lawn Tennis Challenge), the nation’s first appearance at the event. It was also their best showing, as they reached (and lost) the World Group final against the United States, the eventual champions, a feat that Canada has, as of 2010, been unable to match. Outside of tennis he was an attorney and also served as the private secretary of Henri-Gustave Joly de Lotbinière, the seventh lieutenant governor of Quebec, from 1900 through 1904. Powell was a lieutenant in the Canadian Army and served with the 50th Gordon Highlander before transferring to the 48th Canadian Infantry Battalion during World War I. On April 28, 1917 he was killed in action while fighting in France, while leading a platoon of 50 men during the battle of Vimy Ridge.Powell was inducted into the Canadian Tennis Hall of Fame in 1893, and into the USTA Pacific Northwest Hall of Fame in 2000.",Listed in Olympians Who Were Killed or Missing in Action or Died as a Result of War (Lieutenant in the 48th Canadian Infantry Battalion during World War I.

After this he competed often, but rarely reached the podium for major competitions prior to resurfacing in 1992, when short track speed skating was first made an official part of the Olympic program. He competed in only one event at that year’s Winter Olympics, the men’s 5,000m relay, and won silver alongside his teammates, which included his brother, at the Olympic event. He did not originally receive a medal for the Canadian victory in the event, as he skated only in the semifinal, and not the final, round, as he had been injured during the competition and was replaced by Mark Lackie. This decision was later overturned and the younger Daignault received his Olympic silver in 1994, over two years after the event. In December 2006 he joined the United States’ national speed skating program as a coach and technical advisor. He had previously held these positions with Speed Skating Canada since 2000, but left two months after his friend Guy Thibault was dismissed as head coach with the organization.",Brother of Michel Daignault Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the World Short Track Speed Skating Championships (0–2–0 1989 Solihull silver: 5000 m relay; 1990 Amsterdam silver: 5000 m relay) Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the World Short Track Speed Skating Team Championships (1–0–1 1990 Gent gold; 1991 Seoul bronze)

He lost the final on decision to Harry Spanjer, while Russell Van Horn took third place. But more than a year later, Eagan was discovered to have been fighting under an alias. This was not uncommon at the time, as many more wealthy citizens did not want to be associated with sports. Eagan’s real name was Frank Floyd, and he came from Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania. While this may not seem serious, by the rules of the AAU it was illegal to fight under an assumed name, a so-called “ringer”. In November 1905, the AAU decided that “Eagan” would be disqualified from all AAU competitions, and he would have to return his prizes. The Atlantic Association that had knowingly accepted Floyd’s application as Eagan was also expelled from the AAU. As a lightweight, he won two decisions before losing in the finals to Harry Spanjer. He was denied his chance for a rematch with Spanjer when Al Young beat him in the semi-finals of the welterweight class.",

After representing China at the 1988 Games in Seoul, she began her immigration to Canada, which she was inspired to pursue in 1983 at the Universiade in Edmonton, Alberta, where she fell in love with the city and returned in 1989, obtaining her Canadian citizenship in 1994. She soon began coaching and did not compete for 12 years, but as the 2000 Olympic Games approached, and after less than a year of training, she qualified for Team Canada at age 42. At the age of 50 in 2008, she represented Canada again, having come full circle from her beginnings in China, and where a media frenzy followed her everywhere she went during those Games. Luan, is a legend in China where she also won nine national titles and was named one of the top 50 athletes of the past 50 years (before the turn of the century). Books have been written about her, there is a movie about her life, and her name is in school textbooks in China for what she did as a 20-year old at the 1977 World Junior Championships. In her first match, the foil of a Russian snapped and stabbed through Luan’s left arm, her foil arm. The metal was removed from the resulting clean cut, and she continued fencing for 2.5 hours despite her arm turning blue from the deep bleeding. “But I had to try and finish,” she said. “China had not had a female fencer at the worlds in more than 80 years.” Luan won a silver medal and the Chinese had a new hero. Books were written about her, and a movie chronicled her life.

In 1962 Ó Gallchobhair took the position of conductor of the Abbey Theatre Ensemble, which he held until its disbandment. He also worked as a teacher of composition. In his old age he lived with his wife temporarily in Spain and Italy. Ó Gallchobhair was a prolific composer of songs, piano and chamber music, as well as an arranger of traditional Irish music. He also played himself in various orchestras and groups. During his lifetime, his music was very popular. Unlike composers such as Aloys Fleischmann or Brian Boydell, Ó Gallchobhair rejected contemporary styles and argued that even Irish art music should be based on traditional music. From 1935 Ó Gallchobhair wrote 11 ballets on folk themes, and later five light operas or operettas on Irish librettos, and became nationally known for music for Hollywood films, including The Rising of the Moon based on Irish originals and directed by John Ford (1894–1973). One of Ó Gallchobhair’s ballets was Peter Street, described as a “dance drama” like all his ballets, in fact a comic pantomime based on a book by Irish cellist, conductor and librettist Seán Delamere.

70989,Olmeus Charles,Male,16 February 1947,176.0,67, Haiti,HAI,"Haiti’s presence in athletics competitions in the 1970s aroused interest and suspicion, and the performance of Olmeus Charles at the 1976 Montréal Olympics was no exception. Believed to be a member of President “Baby Doc” Duvalier’s infamous Security Force (previously known as Tonton Macoute), that seemed to be good enough reason to get Charles a trip to Canada. Duvalier, who picked the Haiti team in 1972 and 1976, rewarded either trusted friends or members of his Army with Olympic trips. It was obvious Charles was not a runner, as his time of 42:00.11 in his heat of the 10,000 metres confirmed. It was the worst recorded time for the distance. Charles’ time was almost 14 minutes behind that of heat winner Carlos Lopes, and he finished almost eight minutes after the next-to-last man, Chris McCubbins of Canada. Charles still had nearly eight laps remaining when Lopes finished, and the rest of the day’s schedule, and TV schedule, had to be held up while Charles plodded the final six laps all alone. Sections of the crowd booed him, but many more cheered as he showed the real expression of the Olympic ideal and, as each time he passed the giant screens in the stadium, he stopped to wave to himself. When the final bell went he put on a “sprint” to the finish with a last lap of 84 seconds. Much to the delight of the organisers, Charles did not show up at the start of the marathon for which he was also entered. Personal Best: 10000 – 42:00.11 (1976).",

Hill matched strides with the great Lauri Lehtinen and Lauri Virtanen throughout the 1932 Olympic 5,000 m, and although Virtanen was dropped in the closing laps, Hill waged a great battle with Lehtinen in the home straight. In the desperation of the struggle, Lehtinen changed course as the finish approached and impeded Hill. An official protest was overruled, although the decision was not unanimous, and Hill settled for the silver medal. The uproar in the LA Coliseum over this prompted public address announcer Bill Henry to caution the crowd, “Please remember, these people are our guests!”.

After the death of his father, whom he had met for the last time at the age of 10, he made extensive travels through Europe.

In 1923 he became a senior artist at the Bing & Grøndahl porcelain manufactory. In the following years he created mainly faience, for instance for the Sèvres company. He produced at least four life-size sculptures of sporting male figures between 1921 and 1936. In 1924 he won the bronze medal with his bronze sculpture Boxer from 1922. At the time regarded as a not very aesthetic work, Gauguin allegedly owed his medal probably less to his art than to his name.

In her youth she played basketball in middle school and later, at the age of 13 in 1996, discovered athletics and sprinting thanks to professor Paolo Pecora. At the beginning of her international career, she missed the finals at the Youth Worlds 1999 in Bydgoszcz and at the Junior Worlds 2000 in Santiago, both by a few hundredths of a second. In 2002 she improved the Italian junior record in the 200 metres to 23.25, which allowed her to be 4th at the Kingston World Under-20 Championships. Calì’s career was plagued with numerous physical problems. She suffered a slipped disk in 2003, with trouble in the spine and tendinitis, and in 2004 had a motorcycle crash just prior to joining the club Fiamme Azzurre, where she experienced good results, but missed participating at the Athens Olympics. For two consecutive years (2004-05) she won both the 100 and 200 metres at the Italian national championships and in 2005 took two bronze medals at the Under-23 Europeans at Erfurt. Inactive in 2006 due to a fracture in one foot and severe back pain, she moved to Roma for training in the sport facility of her military club, after a surgical operation and a period of training with Francesco Di Mulo in Catania. There she met Giorgio Frinolli, national trainer, two-time Olympian (reserve in 1996 and participant in 2000) in the 400 metres hurdles and son of Roberto, twice Olympic finalist in the same event. In 2008, after setting her personal best in the 100 m. with 11.35 (Milano, 2 July), Calì was finally able to compete at the Olympics in the 200 m (second round) and in the 4x100 m. relay, where she failed to reach the final. A few days after Beijing, on 7 September 2008, she set a personal record in the 200 m. with 22.98, the third Italian woman in history to finish the race in under 23 seconds. Calì took two medals at the 2009 Mediterranean Games, held in Italy, and silver in the 200 m. at the national championships held in Milano and won by the Olympian Giulia Arcioni. After marriage and maternity (2012), she had a national comeback on the track in 2014 (after almost five years) in a Sicilian regional race in the 400 metres. During her international career (2002-09) she earned a total of 13 caps.

In 1960, representing what was known then as the United Arab Republic, he was joint-26th individually with Alwin Schockemöhle of Germany. The team event that year, however, was not merely an amalgamation of the individual scores, but its own separate tournament, and the national squad of Zaki, Gamal Haress, and Elwi Gazi managed to finish fourth overall, largely helped by 12 of the 18 teams failing to have all three riders complete the event.

48856,Daichi Suzuki,Male,10 March 1967,180.0,68, Japan,JPN,"At the 1988 Olympics, Japan’s Daichi Suzuki was not favored for 100 backstroke gold, that role going to Soviet Igor Polyansky, who had won both backstroke events at the 1986 World Championships, and American Dave Berkoff, the world record holder who had pioneered a new technique of swimming as far as possible underwater after the turn, often not breaking the surface until the 35-40 metre mark. This usually gave him a big lead at the turn, and was so advantageous that the other swimmers, including Suzuki, adopted the technique. Berkoff used his technique in Seoul to break the world record in the preliminaries, recording 54.51. In the Seoul final, Berkoff used the technique but only led Suzuki, who had increased his signature underwater dolphin kicks from 21 to 27, by about a body length after the turn, which was less than expected and was not enough, as Suzuki came home faster to win a surprising gold medal. As soon as the Seoul Olympics ended, Berkoff’s underwater start was banned, with the new rule requiring that backstrokers surface and begin stroking on top of the water by 10 metres, although this was later changed to 15 metres. Suzuki first competed internationally at the 1984 Olympics, reaching the B-finals of both backstrokes. He won 100 back and medley relay golds at the 1986 Asian Games, both backstroke events golds at the 1987 Summer Universiade, and a 100 backstroke silver at the 1987 Pan Pacific Championships. After graduating from Jutendo University with a physical education degree, Suzuki worked as a guest researcher at the University of Colorado from 1994-98. From 1998-2000, he was swimming coach at Harvard and from 2000-06 was swimming coach and associate professor at his alma mater Jutendo University. In 2007, Suzuki received a doctorate degree from Jutendo University and became a board member of the Japan Swimming Federation in 2009. In 2010, he was elected to the World Anti-Doping Agency’s Athlete Committee after serving as a board member of the Japan Anti-Doping Agency and a member of the Japan Olympic Committee’s Athlete Committee. From 2012-14, Suzuki was President of the Japan Swimming Federation and also served as the president of the Olympians Association of Japan. In 2015, he was elected as the head of the Japanese Sports Agency, an external bureau of the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports Science and Technology, formed in October 2015, in order to integrate the country’s sports administration, which had been dispersed among multiple ministries.

While at the University of Pittsburgh, Woodruff won the IC4A 440/880 y double for three straight years (1937-39) and in those same three years, he won the NCAA 880y. Although he was supreme in collegiate competition, Woodruff won only one AAU title when he took the 880y championship in 1937. From July 1936, when he lost a badly judged race to Charlie Beetham at the AAU, Woodruff never lost another 800 m/880 y until he retired in 1940. He was, undoubtedly one of the great unfulfilled talents of the sport; apart from his record in the two-lap event, he had such marks to his credit as a 46.8 400 m and a 4:12.8 mile.

His record would hold for nearly 17 years, until it was beaten by Michael Johnson at the Atlanta Olympics. His time is still among the top 10 fastest 200 metres as of January 2012. To his credit, Mennea also beat the low-altitude world record (19.96) the following year. At the Moscow Olympics, he was one of the favorites, even if the Americans had not boycotted the Games. Eventually, he won the gold by only a 0.02 margin, becoming the second Italian to win the 200 title after Livio Berruti in 1960. Earlier in his career, he had claimed three European sprint titles in the 100 (1978) and 200 (1974, 1978), as well as various titles in the Mediterranean Games and Universiade. After a short career break, he also medalled at the 1983 World Championships, in the 200 metres (bronze) and 4x100 relay (silver). After his active career, Mennea was active for the short-lived “I Democrati” party in Italy, and represented them in the European Parliament between 1999 and 2004. A true Italian sporting legend, Mennea was awarded the Olympic order in 1997 and inducted into the Italian Athletic Federation (FIDAl) Hall of Fame. In the 1980s he was appointed Commander of the Order of Merit of the Italian Republic, and Grand Official of the Republic In 2013. The Stadio dei Marmi in Roma was named in his honour and, on 12 September every year, Italian athletics celebrates Pietro Mennea Day, remembering the day in 1979 he set the world 200 metres record. A high-speed train also bears his name. Mennea graduated four times, in political science, law, motor/sports science, and literature, and married lawyer and journalist Manuela Olivieri in 1996. After retiring from competitive athletics, Mennea wrote many essays on sports and legal topics, and practiced as a lawyer and chartered accountant.

For nearly a decade she did not achieve significant results at an individual level, but won several medals at the Olympics and the World Championships as part of the Italian relay team including silver medals at the World Championships in 1991, 1993 and 1999 and bronze medals in 2001 and 2005. Her first individual podium in a World Cup race came in 2001, when she was second in the pre-Olympic pursuit. The following year, on the same tracks, Paruzzi won her only individual international medal, the gold in the 30km mass start classic technique at the Olympic Games in Salt Lake City. During the race one of her poles broke. Her coach was nearby, and she took his pole, although it was too long. She kept on racing and near the end of the race the coach handed her the correct size pole. At the finish line the Italian cross-country skier was second behind the Russian Larisa Lazutina, trailing by almost two minutes. But in December 2003 it was revealed that Lazutina had tested positive for darpopoietin, an erythropoietin analogue, and was disqualified from all events in Salt Lake City, which gave Paruzzi a very surprising gold medal. Her first victory in the World Cup came in 2003 in the 10 km free technique in Lahti. The following season was her best in the World Cup with three wins, nine podiums in total and first place in the overall standings at the end of the season, with second places in both specialty rankings (distance and sprint).

Before his service, he was destined to be a smith, like many generations of ancestors before him, but now he chose a military career. In the Army he also skied competitively for the first time. Although he was from Kareliya, where skiing is a traditional activity, and he had been quite athletic in his youth, Terentyev had not skied much prior to his service due to the lack of equipment. Soon Terentyev became the Army’s best cross-country skier, winning many races by large margins. In 1950 Terentyev had his first podium finish at the Soviet Championships, placng second as a member of the Central Army Sports Club 4x10 km relay team. In the following year he got his first individual podium places at the Soviet Championships, with thirds at both 18 and 30 km. In 1954 he had a clean sweep at the Soviet Championships, placing first in all three races, 18 km, 30 km and 4x10 km relay. In 1954 he also won a silver at the World Championships in Falun as a member of the Soviet 4x10 km relay team. Terentyev went to the 1956 Winter Olympics as the top Soviet cross country skier, but his results were disappointing. He finished sixth and last of the Soviets in the 30 km and won bronze in 50 km. But in the relay race, Terentyev skied an impressive first leg, and largely due to this, the Soviets won the gold medal. Although Terentyev had many podium finishes at the Soviet Championships from 1957-59, he won only one in during that time, in the relay, and he was not selected to the 1960 Winter Olympic team, but in 1958 he was a member of the Soviet relay team that won silver at the World Championships. In 1962 Terentyev won his last Soviet Championship in the 50 km. On 20 January 1963, after winning a 30 km race at the Soviet Army championships near Kavgolovo, Fyodor Terentyev collapsed after the finish and died on his way to hospital.","Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the World Nordic Ski Championships (1–2–1 1954 Falun CCS silver: 4×10 km relay; 1956 Cortina d'Ampezzo (Olympics) CCS gold: 4×10 km relay, bronze: 50 km; 1958 Lahti CCS silver: 4×10 km relay)"

He also came in fifth in the slalom. He returned to the Olympics in 1960 and, after the downhill was postponed, won the gold medal in giant slalom. Believing originally that he had come in second, he was bumped up after it was realized that the time of Pepi Stiegler of Austria had been announced incorrectly. Staub ended up finishing fifth in the downhill and was disqualified in the slalom after failing to complete the first run at these Games. Staub retired from active competition in 1961, having won nine Swiss national titles across various events. Outside of skiing, he had also been active in tennis. He took up work as a skiing instructor in Vail, Colorado, ran a sports store in his native Arosa, and developed his own style of headgear for the sport.

The third son of a lower middle-class family, his father Felice was the director of a textile factory in Olgiate Olona and Nino studied at the Liceo Classico of the Rotondi Archbishop’s College in Gorla Minore. He graduated in engineering at the Polytechnic of Milano and was also a bobsledder, proficient enough that he competed in the four-man bobsleigh at the 1948 Olympic Games in St. Moritz, where he finished the race in eleventh place, piloting the sled of Italia 2. At a very young age Rovelli set up a mechanical workshop in his hometown, which over the years specialized in the production of machine tools for industrial plants. Through this activity he entered into business relations with the chemical industry, to which he supplied pumps and mechanical systems. His early technical skills were visible in the war years, when he patented some operating machines. At the end of the conflict, in the years of the Marshall Plan, he took flight and became a classic example of the post-war self-made man; capable, innovative, but also quick to seize the opportunities of an economic and financial system in the process of rapid transformation, where resources were not lacking. A great storyteller with an exuberant character, his passion for sport led him not only to bobsleigh races, but also to go-karts and race car driving, and he participated for several years in the Mille Miglia. In 1954 he married Primarosa Battistelli, an actress from Milano with some film appearances, a promising theatrical start, and some experience on television, and together they had 4 children: Angelo, Felice, Oscar and Rita. Very connected in the 1960s-70s to political leaders in the government (such as Giulio Andreotti and Giacomo Mancini) from whom he secured significant funding (his company SIR was the third Italian chemical group, after Eni and Montedison), between 1976 and 1977 Rovelli saw his economic empire fall apart and then collapse, including shipping, textile and construction companies. In December 1977 he was accused of aggravated fraud against the country and the illegal export of capital. Practically exhausted from his main duties, convinced that he had done everything wrong, and persuaded that he was at the center of a conspiracy hatched against him by freemasonry, in 1980 Rovelli moved with his wife to Switzerland, which allowed him to escape an arrest warrant in 1981. On 30 December 1990 Rovelli died of cardiac arrest in Zürich while he was undergoing a check-up at the cantonal hospital. Years later it was ascertained that Rovelli had paid several billion lire to three well-known lawyers in Roma to bribe the judges who investigated him.",

Until 2007 her brother Niusila, who took bronze at the 2002 Commonwealth Games in the 85kg snatch category, was the star of the family, but that year Ele took gold in the +75 kg category at both the Oceanian Championships and the Pacific Games and was 11th at the World Championships. Winning the 2008 Oceanian Championships earned her a spot on Samoa’s two woman, four man delegation to that year’s Summer Olympics, where she finished fourth in the Super Heavyweight division, failing to become Samoa’s first Olympic medalist by just one kilogram. In 2016, however, Olha Korobka and Mariya Grabovetskaya, the silver and bronze medalists from Ukraine and Kazakhstan respectively, were disqualified after a retest of their samples showed the presence of banned substances, which makes it likely that Opeloge will be elevated to second place. She then came in fourth at the 2009 World Championships, after winning the Oceanians. Undeterred, Opeloge pressed forward in her quest for an Olympic medal and, in 2010, won the +75 kg class at the Oceania Championships and the Commonwealth Games, setting several records in the process and becoming only the second Samoan Commonwealth Champion in any sport. The first had been Faavae Faauliuli, who won the men’s 94 kg just one day earlier, and her brother would become the third later that day in the 105 kg division. She defended her crown at the 2011 Oceanians and Pacific Games and, after winning the 2012 Commonwealth and Oceania Championships, returned to the Olympics in London, where, after multiple doping disqualifications, she earned a silver medal, the first ever Olympic medal for Samoa in any sport. She won the 2013 and 2014 Oceanian Championships, as well as the 2014 South Pacific Championships but, at the 2014 Commonwealth Games, lost her title to Nigeria’s Mariam Usman.

Ford’s parents saw his potential as a figure skater and moved him to London to be coached by the legendary Gladys Hogg. As he lacked confidence as an individual, Hogg paired him up with Diane Towler in the ice dance, and Ford showed his true ability. The pair went on to dominate the world of ice dancing in the latter half of the 1960s, and their free dance routine to Zorba the Greek became one of the sport’s iconic dances. Having finished third with Towler at the 1964 British Figure Skating Championships, they were third again in 1965 when they went on to finish fourth in both the European and World Championships. The following year saw them start a four-year period in which they dominated ice dancing when they completed the treble of British, European and World titles each year from 1966-69. They also competed at the 1968 Grenoble Winter Olympics when ice dancing was included as an exhibition event, performed just before the Closing Ceremony. No points or medals, however, were awarded. Ford and Towler turned professional after winning the 1969 world title and won the World Professional Ice Dance Championship in their first year as paid skaters. Ford later became a successful coach and emigrated to Canada in 1970 where he coached over 20 national champions and many ice dance duos, including 1986 World Championship bronze medallists Tracy Wilson and Rob McCall. Ford also established the National Ice Dance Centre of Canada and was a co-founder of the Ford Skating School. He was a successful choreographer, and was one of the four co-inventors of the Cha-Cha Congelado, which became an International Skating Union pattern dance after its début at Richmond Hill, Ontario, in 1989. Ford also taught in the United States and produced more national champions, and also coached Australian and Japanese teams at the World Championships. Ford was awarded the MBE in 1970, and was inducted into the World Figure Skating Hall of Fame, British Skating Hall of Fame, Skate Canada Hall of Fame, and the Richmond Hill Sports Hall of Fame (Canada).

But he was the winner of the AAA steeplechase in four of the five years in which he competed in the event and his only defeat came in 1922 when he surprisingly finished back in fifth place. In 1920 he had his shoe ripped off in the second lap of the AAA race and lost some 100 yards on the leaders but still went on to win by 75 yards, establishing himself as one of the favorites for the Olympic title. Hodge was the fastest heat winner at Antwerp and his time of 10:17.4 seconds over 3000 metres represented something considerably faster than he had ever run over the “English” distance of 2 miles. Possibly, Hodge’s main concern for the final was that the race was to start at 9:00 AM and his great friend and mentor Joe Binks was unable to be at the start, because of a serious accident to his father, Hodge was well supported by other members of the British team and won the gold medal by the convincing margin of 100 metres. Hodge had a highly unusual style of hurdling, which he brought to such a fine art that he could clear the barriers carrying a tray, complete with bottle and glasses, and not spill a drop. He often demonstrated the feat on the stage and at sports meetings. Apart from his steeplechasing ability, he was an excellent performer on the flat and in the match against France in 1921 he finished third in the 1,500 metres and was the first Englishman home.

International wrestling was then scored by a demerit system, known as “bad points.” When a wrestler accumulated six bad points, they were eliminated.

Keaser wrestling with that end in mind and was beaten decisively on points.

He attained US citizenship, changed his name to John, and attended West Point, where he was on the boxing team for four years and the fencing team for two years. At West Point he was nicknamed Rudolph Vaselino because of his slicked-back hair, but he was often later known as Frenchy because of his background. Grombach made the 1924 US Olympic boxing team as an alternate, but did not compete. He later won a US Fencing Championship in team épée with the New York AC team in 1938. Grombach also became known as a historian of the Olympics, writing several books on the Games. Grombach would eventually rise to brigadier general during his military career. In 1942 he was chosen to lead a secret intelligence gathering organization that would become known as The Pond, which was to operate independently of the Office of Strategic Services (OSS), the forerunner of the CIA. The Pond operated under the cover of multinational corporations, including American Express, Chase National Bank and Philips, the Dutch-based electronic giant. Grombach directed The Pond from an office at the Steinway Hall building in New York, where he assumed the cover of a public relations consultant for Philips. The Pond operated into the mid-1950s, often as an antagonist to the CIA. Grombach was known as an informer for US Congressman Joe McCarthy, who famously intimated that the US government and intelligence agencies were infiltrated by Communists, and began a witch-hunt against them that often proved fruitless. The Pond was a virtually unknown organization until 1000s of its papers were found in locked safes and file cabinets in Culpepper, Virginia in 2001. It took until 2008 for the papers to be released after review by the CIA.",

She had one more victory in 1984 prior to the Olympics, which she entered as a slight favorite in the downhill. In Sarajevo, however, she came up short of her compatriot Michela Figini’s gold medal-winning time by 0.05 seconds and had to settle for silver, while also failing to complete the giant slalom. Nonetheless she captured the downhill World Cup title that year and followed it up with overall titles in 1986 and 1987. The latter year was arguably the best of her career, as she also won the downhill and Super G events and bronze in the giant slalom at the World Championships. At the 1988 Winter Olympics she was considered a favorite in the downhill and the Super G, but ended up fourth and sixth in those events respectively. She did, however, capture bronze medals in the giant slalom and the combined. Walliser had one more major victory, in the downhill at the 1989 World Championships, prior to her retirement in 1990. She had 72 podium finishes at the World Cup over her career, 25 of which were victories.

With only one more World Cup point finish in the next season before the 1994 Olympics Moser was chosen as a reserve, but after some very good performances in practice at Lillehammer he made the team and was chosen to compete in all three events. The bronze medal with the Austrian team was the highlight of his career and in the first World Cup event after the Games Moser made his only podium finish in an individual competition in March 1994 in Lahti with a silver. On the same day he was also a member of the Austrian team (with the same line-up as two weeks earlier at the Olympics) which won the team jumping – Moser’s only first-place finish in the World Cup.

At the latter he met his future Olympic teammates Duggie Du Preez and Dennis Shepherd while competing in the bantamweight division. Williams won several local and provincial championships, but soon realized that he would never be able to defeat Vic Toweel, a rising star in the South African boxing scene. He therefore began competing as a flyweight and it was in this division that he succeeded in making the national Olympic team. At the 1948 Summer Games he made it to the second round, but the starvation diet required to maintain his flyweight status left him too weak to defeat eventual gold medalist Pascual Pérez. Williams continued amateur boxing until 1951, when he returned to the bantamweight division and went professional. He lost or drew all four of his bouts at this level and retired from the sport by the end of the year, electing to take a job as a sales representative and holding it for over 50 years.",

She was also a fine long-distance swimmer and twice won the National Long-Distance Championship on the Thames, and was the 1923 winner of the 8km race on the Seine in Paris. She is credited with introducing the six-beat crawl stroke to England, a measure which enabled swimmers to move much faster across the water. It certainly worked for her because she held every British freestyle record, 100y to one mile. Despite being a potential winner of three gold medals at the 1924 Olympics, she announced in December 1923 that she did not wish to represent Great Britain at the forthcoming Games because: “She had been subjected to unfair criticism, unfair treatment and boycott by certain officials in the swimming world.” In 1925 James was invited by the South Africa Amateur Swimming Union to participate in a demonstration tour and a series of galas to promote swimming in South Africa and the former Rhodesia. For the next five years, she worked on cruise ships of the Cunard Line, where she met her future husband William McAllister. They married in 1930 and had one son. James was posthumously inducted into the International Swimming Hall of Fame in 2016.","Listed in Olympians Who Set a European Record in Long Course Swimming (400 m freestyle – 29 July 1921 - 2 September 1927: 6:16.6 (29 July 1921; Leeds, GBR)) Listed in Olympians Who Set a World Record in Long Course Swimming (400 m freestyle – 29 July 1921 - 4 August 1922: 6:16.6 (29 July 1921; Leeds, GBR))"

While still enrolled at Kawabata he studied French in the Athéné Français in order to go to France, which he did in 1923. There, he visited Tsuguharu-Léonard Fujita and was invited to the Salon de l’Escalier. Ebihara held an individual exhibition in New York in 1928. During his stay in France, Ebihara created a series of snowy landscapes resembling the world of a fairy tale. Also typical for his work were the use of the blue colors and frequent horse motifs. Ebihara returned to Japan in 1934 and presented his works at the Nika-kai (Second Section Association), and other independent exhibitions, but also at the Salon d’Automne in Paris. During World War II, he spent more than one year in Dalian in occupied China. After the war, he settled on Kyushu Island, where he founded his own art institute in the city of Kumamoto in April 1951. It closed in 1953 but was re-opened from 1957 until 1966. Ebihara’s works from the 1950s continued to build his world-wide reputation and won him a number of prestigious awards. In 1960, he returned to the Tokyo region and took up residence in Zushi in the Kanagawa Prefecture. At the 1964 Tokyo Olympic Games his “Rainy Day” was featured during the “Modern Japanese Art” exhibition. In January 1968 he went to Europe and stayed with his friend Fujita during the last weeks of his life. He traveled in Europe, visiting various places, but eventually died in Paris from cancer of the digestive system. His painting Skating today bears the Japanese title Sukēto, but initially Pachinājiyu (after the Italian term “Pattinaggio” for skating). It was painted during his time in Paris in the typical Ebihara blue that has become famous. It bears the number 60 and measures 130 x 97 cm. It is also possible, however, that the painting submitted in 1936 was another very similar one from the same series.",

His only medal, however, was a bronze in the 4 x 200 freestyle relay in 1920. Four years later Annison also competed as a water polo player at Paris. He was also an excellent long-distance swimmer, making the podium at the British Championships in the River Thames swims in 1921 and 1924, finishing third and second respectively behind winner Jack Hatfield on both occasions. Annison won ASA freestyle titles at every distance except five miles and was also the 1920 National Salt-Water quarter-mile champion. His first title was at the age of 18 in 1913 when he prevented Jack Hatfield winning all the freestyle titles that year, by winning the 100y. He made his England debut soon afterwards. Annison was later employed as a baths manager and in 1934 became the first manager of the new Brighton Aquatic Stadium. In 1936 he devised a 10-mile relay race that involved ten swimmers who would be a mixture of sprinters, middle- and long-distance swimmers. That same year his book Swimming, an instructional book for swimmers of all standards, was published and became part of the Pitman Games and Recreations series. Harold’s brother Reggie was also a fine swimmer and the two siblings played alongside each other in the Croydon SC water polo team.",

Born in London to Nigerian parents, he initially divided his sporting interests between athletics, basketball and American football before choosing to concentrate on the triple jump. Idowu emerged as a serious force in the event in 2000 when he finished sixth in his first Olympic Games. The 2002 Commonwealth Games saw Idowu win the silver medal behind compatriot Jonathan Edwards but his upward momentum was broken when he had to sit out 2003 due to a knee injury. After Edwards’ retirement Idowu found himself as the British #1 but he could not emulate Edwards’ Sydney Olympic victory in 2004, He did reach the final in Athens and produced a series of three long jumps but each one was adjudged a foul and he failed to make the cut for another three jumps. He continued his affinity with the Commonwealth Games when he won the triple jump at the 2006 edition in Melbourne but it was not until 2008 that he became a major player on the world scene. Idowu began his improvement by winning the European Indoor Championships and, after a series of fine performances over the summer, arrived in Beijing as one of the leading medal contenders. He led the qualifying competition and was leading the final at the half way stage before being overhauled by Nelson Evora and having to settle for the silver. By now in his 30s, Idowu continued his improved form and won the 2009 World Championships and 2010 European Championship title. The latter was won in a new personal best of 17.81 m. Although he was unable to defend his world title in 2011 he still took the silver medal in the event and remains one of the world’s top performers. Idowu had fitness issues going into the London Olympics and sadly failed to make the final 12.

922550,Kenneth MacLeod,Male,2 February 1888,,, Great Britain,GBR,"Kenneth Grant MacLeod was probably the greatest all-round Scottish sportsman ever seen. Educated at Fettes College, Edinburgh, and then Pembroke College, Cambridge, where he became a triple Blue at cricket, athletics, and rugby. He could have also won a golf Blue had he devoted more time to the sport. As a rugby player, MacLeod was a fast three-quarter or winger and played in the Varsity match four years in succession 1905-08. He also won the 100 yards in three successive years, 1906-08, and was the 1906 Scottish long jump champion. MacLeod played rugby for Scotland 10 times between 1905-08 and would have played for them earlier while still at Fettes School had his headmaster not outlawed the selection. MacLeod made his international début in the 1905 match against the All Blacks at Inverleith, when his brother Lewis played alongside him. At cricket, Kenneth MacLeod played 94 First Class matches for Cambridge University and Lancashire between 1908-14, scoring 3,458 runs, including a memorable 131 against Leicestershire at Old Trafford in 1911. As a bowler, he took 103 wickets with personal best figures of 6 for 29. The son of a wealthy tobacco importer, living in Liverpool at the turn of the 20th century, MacLeod was one of three rugby-playing siblings. Donald played for Birkenhead Park and Cheshire while fellow Scottish international Lewis was a Cambridge Blue and was captain in 1905 when Kenneth won his first rugby Blue. Lewis also played for Birkenhead Park and was club captain at the time of his untimely death during a seemingly routine appendicitis operation at the end of 1907. The two brothers played together for Cambridge in a memorable match against the touring All Blacks in 1905, when a record crowd witnessed one of the finest games of rugby seen at the University ground. Had it not been for the MacLeod brothers thwarting many New Zealand attacks, the tourists would have won by a bigger margin than 14-0. The death of Lewis affected Kenneth badly and on 4 January 1909, after his time at university, he announced his retirement from rugby and athletics. His father also felt it was time he got a job, and Kenneth secured himself a school-teaching post. MacLeod joined the Gordon Highlanders at the start of World War I and was wounded in March 1915; six months later his other rugby-playing brother Donald was killed at Ypres, when hit by a German shell while talking with three colleagues. MacLeod’s father made a vast fortune from his tobacco business and when he died in 1927 left an estate worth £255,000 – the equivalent of over £16 million in 2020.",

After the war, the family spent several years in the United States, before settling in the Netherlands when Fred is 13. With his brother, he then discovered water polo, joining AZ&PC in Amersfoort. Both quickly make it to the first team. Less than two years later, Fred is already called up for his first international match. He was also selected for the 1956 Olympics in Melbourne, but never played as the Dutch withdrew from the Games over the Soviet crushing of the Hungarian revolt. Fred would more than make up for this by competing at the 1960, 1964 and 1968 Games. At the latter Games, he also carried the flag during the opening ceremony. Van Dorp’s appearance in 1964 was the most notable, as in the preliminary round he faced his brother. Now known as Tony van Dorp, he had moved to the US in 1959 and played as a goalkeeper for that country at the 1964 and 1968 Olympics. Fred scored once against his brother, but Tony also stopped penalty shot. It was only the second time in history that brothers competed against each other at the Olympics for different nations, and the first time at the Summer Games. In total, Fred van Dorp played 151 international matches, including at the 1958, 1962 and 1966 European Championships. After his playing years, Van Dorp became a referee.

That year, when barely 17, he won the Canadian mile championship in 4:23.2 and from then on his successes were legion. Kiviat became one of the greatest indoor runners of all time and, despite his casual training methods and his inelegant bow-legged running style, he was also a record-breaker outdoors. Indoors, he won the AAU 600 y twice and the 1,000 y three times; at the outdoor championships he won the mile in 1911, 1912, and 1914. He also won the AAU cross-country title in 1913 when he led his Irish-American AC team to the team title. During his build-up for the 1912 Olympics he set three 1,500 m world records in 13 days, culminating with a mark of 3:55.8 at the Olympic Trials when he continued on to the mile post, where he was clocked in 4:15.6, which was only 0.2 seconds outside the world record. Kiviat arrived in Stockholm as the favorite for the 1,500 m title, but he was surprised by the home stretch drive of Oxford undergraduate Arnold Jackson and he took second in a photo from his teammate Norman Taber. However, Kiviat’s world record held and remained unbeaten for five more years. After seeing front line service with the army in France, he continued his athletic career until 1925. He coached track briefly but maintained a lifelong interest in the sport, officiating at major meets for more than 60 years and serving as chief press steward at the Penn Relays and many Madison Square Garden meets.

When his extraordinary speed had been noticed, he switched to sprinting and proved to be a particularly quick starter. Later, Catalon studied at the University of Santo Tomas in Manila from where he graduated in 1922. His first international success came in 1917, when he won the double (100 y and 220 y) at the Far Eastern Games in Tokyo, running 10 seconds flat in the 100 y for a new championship record. Catalon repeated this feat three times at the 1919-23 Far Eastern Games. In the 1923 edition, he improved the championship record to 22.2 in the 220 y. With a personal best of 9.8 seconds over the 100 y, Catalon was ranked sixth in the world in the same year. Elwood Brown, American leader of the Philippine Amateur Athletic Association and one of the initiators of the Far Eastern Games, arranged for the first participation of the Philippines in the 1924 Paris Olympics. Catalon was entered in the 100 and 200 m events, but eventually only fellow countryman David Nepomuceno represented the country in Paris after his victory in the local trials. After the distances were changed from yards to meters at the Far Eastern Games, Catalon continued his winning streak in the 100 m in 1925. His only defeat in individual events at five Far Eastern Games came in the 200 m when he was beaten by Nepomuceno. Nevertheless, with nine individual titles, Catalon was the most successful track and field athlete in the history of the Far Eastern Games adding additional gold medals in the 4 x 220 y relay with the Filipino team. Catalon started the 100 m finals at the last Far Eastern Games in 1934 as well as in the 1954 Asian Games, both held in Manila. He is candidate for induction into the projected Philippine Sports Hall of Fame. Catalon was immortalized, acting as the model for the iconic Glico Man in Osaka’s entertainment district, advertising Glico candies. After retiring from active sports, he became a coach and official.",

When BP wanted to move him to London, Wendon took a pay-off, and embarked on another career change, as a silver and jewellery dealer.",

Originally from Amsterdam, Van Beek liked to paint in the small nearby village of Kortenhoef, where he settled in 1911. Painter Paul Gabriël (1828-1903) was a major influence on van Beek’s early work, which later was heavily influenced by the Haagse School and, to a lesser extent, Amsterdam Impressionism. His landscapes featured mostly summer or polder views of the immediate surroundings of Kortenhoef.

In 1935, Stemmler was banned from work by the Nazis, and in 1944 she was declared undesirable for the German nationality. In 1939 the couple moved to Paris, leaving behind all of her previous work, which was then destroyed in 1942 in a bombing raid. In France, Stemmler was interned in a camp for 15 months. In 1942 the couple immigrated to Switzerland and received Swiss citizenship in 1947. She was a close friend of Willi Baumeister and his later wife Margarete Oehm (1898-1978).

Since his commander in the military was also chairman of his club, he was given the opportunity to improve his skiing abilities, and became Swedish military champion during this time. He later took a job at a sports shop in Umeå, where his rival and friend Gunnar Karlsson was also employed. Later Martin Lundström was also employed in the shop and joined the club. The three of them formed a very successful relay team and were also successful individually. With the club team he won four Swedish relay championships, including three successive titles together with Karlsson and Lundström. Ericson’s first individual Swedish Championship came in 1945, when he managed to beat Nils Karlsson over 30 km by more than a minute. The years 1947 and 1948 were his best as a skier, winning the Swedish Championship over 50 km in 1948 just before the Olympic Winter Games, where he won silver in the same event. Ericson considered his victory at the Holmenkollen ski festival over the 50 km as his best race, with stronger competition than in St. Moritz. The next few seasons he was struck by injuries and diseases including persistent throat problems. But for the 1952 Winter Olympics, he was well trained, but on the day of the race, was not able to start due to a high fever. Ericson was so disappointed that he went back home and gave away his skis and equipment, deciding to retire. Nevertheless, he competed on some occasions, including another Vasa run, but he had reduced his training after his return to Örträsk. In 1945 he received the VK-gold, a sports prize awarded by a local magazine.",Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the World Nordic Ski Championships (0–1–0 1948 St. Moritz (Olympics) CCS silver: 50 km)

Buller’s success as a fencer started in 1948 when she won the British junior title, and within two years was competing with the leading fencers of the day. In 1950, she finished third in the coveted Desprez Challenge Cup, won by Gillian Sheen. The following year Buller was runner-up to Sheen in the Desprez Cup, and at the British Ladies Foil Championship, was third behind Sheen and Mary Glen-Haig.

In October 1952 Buller married Commander Peter William Beckwith Ashmore at Shipley, Sussex, and the wedding was attended by three leading members of the Royal Family; Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II, her sister Princess Margaret, and The Queen Mother.

After the Communist Party took control of Romania, Apostol’s position became tenuous. In May 1951, he was removed from among the Army elites, as “he was wealthy and couldn’t be trusted.” In the secret information sheet produced by Lt. Ursache Ştefan on 11 September 1953, it was noted that Apostol, “was rich, of unwealthy social origin”, and that “his father has 20 hectares of arable land and his wife 11 hectares of living and two houses in Buzău” and, therefore, was untrustworthy for the new Romanian government. His war service was noted, but Ştefan concluded that “the material state of his parents and wife does not guarantee his attachment to the working class.” Apostol spent the 1950s working as a riding technician, but on 20 July 1959 his case was settled and he was sentenced by the Bucharest Military Court to 6 years in jail as he had been considered against the social order and 3 years in correctional bans, along with the total confiscation of his personal property. He was imprisoned in Jilava, Peliprava, and Grind prisons and was released from Jilava Penitentiary on 15 April 1964. Apostol was retired from the military in January 1964 and spent his remaining years in Buzău where he worked as a farmer. Some measure of reconciliation occurred after his death, in 2010, when the Săgeata Commune Council, Buzău County, named the street where he was born in Apostol’s honor.","Listed in Olympians Who Were Sent to Prison (Imprisoned for 5 years (1959-64), because he was considered against the Romanian social order.)"

79001,Jackson Scholz,Male,15 March 1897,172.0,61, United States,USA,"Jackson Scholz was the first man to reach the final of an individual sprint event at three separate Olympic Games. In 1920 he was a finalist in the 100m, in 1924 he won the 200m and was second in the 100m, and in 1928 he made the final of the 200m, narrowly missing a fourth Olympic medal. Initially Scholz was placed equal third with Helmut Körnig of Germany but the judges ruled in favor of a run-off the next day. Scholz had already left the track and begun partying and the next day he was in no shape to run, so he declined the offer. The photo of the finish subsequently showed that this was, in fact, the correct decision. Scholz, who attended Missouri, had a great competitive record and could claim victories over all the great sprinters of his era. In his 10 races with Charlie Paddock he won seven and tied another, but the 220y in 1925 was, surprisingly the only AAU title that he won. Scholz also laid claim to world records at 100y, 200m, and the 4 x 100m relay. Jackson Scholz later became well known as a writer of pulp fiction. The movie, “Chariots of Fire,” again made Scholz famous by portraying him as a leading character. Shortly after the movie, when asked how he would like to be remembered, he remarked, “ … as a winner, a successful runner, a decent writer and a gentleman. And one other thing … I was fast. I hope they remember I was fast.” Personal Bests: 100 – 10.5 (1924); 200 – 21.2y (1926).",

Balcárek and Kopp were awarded second place for the plans they submitted to the 1932 Olympic Art Competition. After Dryák´s death in 1932, the planning work was finally entrusted to Balcárek and Kopp, and the upgrade was completed between 1932-38, with the wooden structure converted to reinforced concrete and brick. The northern and southern grandstands, one of his 1948 entries, were already planned in 1937 and ultimately built in 1946-48 for the now renamed Masaryk Stadium complex and further expanded in 1975. With a surface area of more than 63,000 m² and a capacity of up to 250,000 spectators, it is considered the largest stadium ever built. Here, mainly major events of the Sokol Movement and, after World War II, the Spartakiades took place. Although parts of the stadium have now deteriorated, it is on the World Heritage list of UNESCO. The adjacent athletics stadium – the work submitted in 1932 – was built after the construction of the large stadium in 1931-35, according to the Dryák’s concept, by Balcárek and Kopp. Most interesting was the western tribune of reinforced concrete. From 1975-78, the stadium was rebuilt for the needs of the European Athletics Championships. Information about the “Project for a sports center in the city of Pisek” is not available.

Halstead won an unprecedented WAAA treble of 100 yards, 220 yards and 440 yards in 1931 and in the latter event she set a new world record of 58.2 seconds. She retained her 220 and 440 titles the following year and in retaining her quarter-mile title she broke her own world record by a further two seconds with a record that stood 22 years. For the 1932 Los Angeles Olympics, Halstead was chosen only for the sprint relay but was a member of the Great Britain team that won the bronze medal. When she returned home, 10,000 fans lined the streets of her home-town, Radcliffe, to welcome their hero home. In 1933 Halstead won the AAA quarter mile, which by then, was then the 400 metre. She won the 200 in 1934 and in 1935 she captured the 800 metres title in what was her first competitive race over the distance. Victory meant she was only the second woman after Mary Lines to win the 100-220-440-880 (800m) at the WAAA. She took her tally of national titles to 11 when she won the 400 in 1937 and 800 in 1938. In addition she won a gold medal in the 440 yards relay at the 1934 British Empire Games in London, a silver in the 660 yards relay and a bronze in the individual 220 yards She was to add two more national titles to her collection - at cross country. Three weeks after taking up the sport in 1935 she easily won the National Cross Country Championship at Morecambe, maintaining that she only entered the race to keep her Radcliffe Harriers team-mates company. Also in 1935, she won the individual race in the first ever international cross country meeting between England and Scotland, and the following year she retained her National title. Halstead was also a fine footballer in the late 1930 and was a centre-forward with the Bolton Ladies team. She was also an excellent golfer, and for many years before her death, was equally as well known in Radcliffe for the cheese stall she ran in the local market as for her running achievements. Her sister Edith was the AAA javelin champion in 1932, and a silver medalist at the 1934 Empire Games. She was later sexually re-assigned and became known as Edwin, or “Eddie”.

He was a member of several well-known clubs like Larchmont Yacht Club, the Cruising Club of America, New York Athletic Club, Essex Yacht Club, and the Island Sailing Club of Cowes, England. Despite his sailing expertise, he was better known as a sailmaker. Ratsey joined the family firm of sailmakers founded at Cowes by his great-grandfather, George Rogers Ratsey, in 1796 and were soon acknowledged as the best sailmakers in Britain. The oldest firm of sailmakers in the world, their sails were to be seen on many vessels in Lord Nelson’s fleet at the Battle of Trafalgar. After merging with fellow sailmakers Lapthorn in 1882, to establish Ratsey & Lapthorn, they soon established themselves as the best sailmakers in the world after setting up business in the United States at the Robert Jacob’s City Island boatyard in 1902. The company was involved in making sails for both defenders and challengers in the America’s Cup in the early days of the event and they designed many of the sails for Sir Thomas Lipton series of “Shamrock” challengers. Ratsey’s son Colin served his apprenticeship with the family firm and worked for them for over 50 years. He too was an Olympic medallist, winning a silver in 1932.",Father of Colin Ratsey

Nevertheless, she was once again named Canadian champion and managed to win second place at the World Championships.

It was the same year that he entered the University of Notre Dame and began a string of victories in the quarter-mile and half-mile that left him undefeated in these events at the collegiate level. He also set an indoor record of 49.3 seconds in the 440 yards, as well as several other Canadian national ones. During these four years he also acquired numerous medals at the international level. At the 1930 British Empire Games he captured the 440 yard title as well as silver in the 4x440 yard relay (with Olympians Jimmy Ball, Stan Glover, and non-Olympian Art Scott) and bronze in the 880 yard competition. At the 1932 Summer Olympics he medaled in every event that he entered, taking silver in the 800 metres and bronze in the 400 metres and the 4x400 relay. Shortly thereafter he graduated from Notre Dame and retired from active competition. Wilson then transformed his passion for athletics into a lifelong career. He quickly secured a coaching position at Loyola University Chicago and spent the next 13 years coaching swimming, basketball, cross-country, and track before being promoted to athletics director in 1945. Five years later he returned to Notre Dame, now as a track coach, and remained there until his 1972 retirement, garnering a 1957 National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) cross-country championship title in the process. He was inducted as a member of the Canadian Track (1954) and Helms Athletic Foundation Halls of Fame (1967) and was named NCAA cross country coach of the year in 1972.

This because he represented an American club at the 1904 Olympics. Between 1903 and 1906, Lenhart worked in a machine factory in Philadelphia, and had joined the local turnverein (German gymnastics club). Clubs were allowed to enter members that had signed up at least six months prior to the Olympics, which allowed Lenhart to compete for the Philadelphia Turngemeinde at the St. Louis Games. It is debatable whether his nationality should be considered as Austrian or American at the 1904 Olympics, but he is considered by the International Olympic Committee as a United States competitor, since he represented an American club. A real gymnast, Lenhart performed poorly in the athletics events that formed part of the all-around competition, but his skills on the apparatuses made up for that and won him the title, while Philadelphia won the team event. Lenhart himself was aware that he was billed as an American champion, writing about his Olympic experiences in the Austrian Sportzeitung in 1936. Lenhart, who had spent some time in Germany prior to his spell in the US, returned to Austria in 1906 and quit gymnastics two years later to work as an engineer constructing machinery.

Specializing in speed events, she débuted in international racing in 1993, winning gold in the super-G at the World Junior Championships. In the 1993-94 season she started competing in the World Cup and won her first race, the downhill in Garmisch-Partenkirchen, an event that was tragically marred by the accident that took the life of the Austrian Ulrike Maier. A few days later Kostner won two bronze medals at the 1994 Olympic Winter Games in Lillehammer, and she won back-to-back world titles in the super-G in 1996 and 1997. In the 2000-01 season she became the first Italian to win the downhill World Cup, in addition to a silver medal in the super-G at the World Championships. The following season Kostner confirmed her excellent form, winning the downhill World Cup for a second time and winning the silver medal in the same event at the 2002 Salt Lake City Winter Olympics, where she also carried the Italian flag at the Opening Ceremony. Kostner won 18 medals at the Italian Championships, seven downhill, nine in the super-G and two in the giant slalom, including 12 titles. One month before the 2006 Winter Olympics, Kostner announced her retirement from racing, devoting herself to her family and the child she was awaiting with fellow alpine skier and Olympian Werner Perathoner. During the Closing Ceremony of the 2006 Olympic Winter Games she marched into the arena in a wedding dress to extinguish the Olympic flame. She later participated in the television show “Nights on Ice.” Kostner attended a design school to become a “barrel painter,” or painting wooden carvings.

When the Fédération Equestrian Internationale (FEI) was formed in 1921, it was decided that only commissioned army officers could compete at the Olympic Games, as it was considered that only they would compete in the appropriate amateur and sporting manner. That rule still stood during the 1948 Olympics, where Sweden, who had dominated the sport since the 1912 Olympics, appeared to win the dressage team event by a wide margin. But just after the Olympics, the French secretary-general of FEI Georges Hector, discovered that Persson had been promoted from the rank of fanjunkare (roughly a sergeant-major in the US Army) to lieutenant and was demoted back to fanjunkare after the Olympics, which led the FEI to disqualify him in April 1949 and thus the team gold medals were awarded to France. In November 1949, FEI loosened the restrictions, which allowed non-commissioned officers, civilians and women to compete at future Olympics. Persson was back at the 1952 and 1956 Olympics, winning the team dressage gold both times. His best individual finish was at the 1956 Olympics, when he finished fourth. Persson was the best Swedish dressage rider of the 1950s, winning national titles in 1951-55, 1959 and 1961. By profession Persson was a remount rider, a man whose job was to prepare young horses for the military, serving with the K4 Norrland Dragoon Regiment. He retired from the Army in 1968.",

In 1909 Bailey won the first of three National sprint titles, and that same year won his first World title. Bailey won the sprint title at the World Amateur Championship four times in 1909-11 and 1913 (he did not compete in the USA in 1912). In addition, he won Europe’s leading sprint race, the Grand Prix de Paris in four successive years 1910-13. Bailey also won four British Empire Championships and six national sprint titles as well as setting several British and world short distance world records. His half-mile record of 54.4 seconds off a flying start, set in 1908, stood for over 25 years. Bailey turned professional in March 1914 but the War years intervened. However, in 1920, he won a bronze medal in the sprint at the World Championships in Belgium, and at the age of 40, he established a British sanding start half-mile record of 58 seconds, just two-fifths of a second slower than when he set he amateur record 20 years earlier. Bailey raced in the USA a lot, and won so often that the American fans would affectionately sing “Won’t you go home Bill Bailey” to him. After his racing days, Bailey organised race meetings at the famous banked circuit at Brooklands, and became coach to the Great Britain team at the 1928 Olympics.

His first contact with sports came in 1937, when he took part in a stone throwing demonstration. A few months later, during a Fascist Youth Movement meeting, he was spotted by Bovi, who took him under his wing and turned him into a discus thrower. By 1938 he represented Italy in the European Championships, coming fifth, and the following year he won the first of his 15 Italian titles. After World War II, during which he broke the world record (53.34) at the Giuriati club in Milan (in 1941), he won the first of his three consecutive European titles in 1946 and extended his world record to 54.23. In 1948, Consolini reached the zenith of his career with victory at the London Olympics, his throw of 52.78 seeing him finish a metre ahead of compatriot Giuseppe Tosi. After the Games he set his third and final world record, 55.33, at Milan Arena. He married Hanny, an Austrian fan of his, and found work at Pirelli, where he remained for the rest of his working life. He did not defend his crown in Helsinki, taking the silver behind American Sim Iness. He then competed in Melbourne (sixth) and also Roma where, at 43 years of age, he recited the Olympic Oath at the Opening Ceremony and finished 17th in the competition. Inbetween he finished sixth in the 1958 European Championships discus throw. Consolini ended his competitive career in 1960, but continued throwing recreationally until he was 52, throwing 43.94 in Milan. Five months later he died from a form of viral hepatitis.

920316,Georges Dubois,Male,18 March 1865,168.0,75, France,FRA,"Georges Dubois exhibited as a sculptor from about 1890. In 1900, he created the monument in the Jardin du Luxembourg at Paris (Quartier Latin, 6th Arrondissement) that commemorated the 50th anniversary of the death of Frédéric Chopin. It was melted down during the World War II occupation but was replaced by a copy in a retired corner near the bust of Sainte Beuve. Since Dubois could not support his family as a sculptor, the enthusiastic athlete appeared at times in the circus. Finally, he gave up sculpturing and became a fencing master, for instance as armorer at the Opéra-Comique. He was named the “Forgotten Master of Ancient Fencing”, as he studied savate and fencing since childhood and was interested in the intellectual and physical challenges of ancient fencing. Dubois wrote various treatises on this subject and other forms of self-defense. In 1906 he was one of the participants in the “Consultative Conference on Art, Literature and Sport” and was probably acquainted with Pierre de Coubertin. At the 1912 Stockholm Art Competitions he was awarded the silver medal for his work Model of the Entrance to a Modern Stadium in the category Sculpturing. The submitted work is described in detail in the Revue Olympique of July 1912. It is said to have been a kind of triumphal arch with a bas-relief. The planned dimensions were 14-15 m in height and about 16 m in width.",

25282,Bill Slater,Male,29 April 1927,,, Great Britain,GBR,"After playing in the Lancashire and District Youth League and then for Yorkshire Amateurs and Leeds University, Bill Slater joined Blackpool in 1944 but he was then called up for National Service and spent most of the next three years in Germany, occasionally turning out for Blackpool. After he was demobbed, they wanted him to turn professional but he continued with his physical education course at Leeds and remained an amateur. Following an injury to team-mate Allan Brown, Slater was given the inside-left position in the Blackpool team that lost to Newcastle United in the 1951 FA Cup Final. Bill became the third, and last, post-war amateur to play in the Cup Final after Arthur Turner of Charlton and Peter Kippax of Burnley. The next season he moved south and joined Brentford and was then selected for the Great Britain team to compete at the Helsinki Olympic Games. Bill played in Britain’s only match and scored one of their extra time goals in the 5-3 defeat by Luxembourg. After the Olympics he joined Wolverhampton Wanderers, still as an amateur as he had a teaching post at Birmingham University. He made his debut in a 6-2 win over the reigning League champions Manchester United in October 1952 but only played a few games in his first season. However he was a first team regular in the 1953-54 season as Wolves captured their first ever League title. At the end of the season the directors were keen to give him a full time contract but they compromised and he signed as a part-time professional, carrying on with his job at Birmingham University. Bill’s signing-on fee was £10. Having previously won 20 England Amateur caps, he won the first of his 12 full England caps against Wales in 1954. He subsequently lost his England place to the great Duncan Edwards and he also spent part of the 1957-58 season in Wolves’ reserves as they went on to win their second League title. Following the death of Edwards in the Munich air disaster, Slater regained his place in the England team and he played in all four of England’s matches in the 1958 World Cup in Sweden. Back home, Wolves collected their third League title in 1958-59 and in 1960 Bill won that elusive FA Cup winners’ medal when he captained the Wolves team that beat Blackburn Rovers 3-0 at Wembley. He was also honoured with the Football Writers’ Player of the Year Award in 1960 – the first Olympian to receive the award. Bill eventually moved back to Brentford in the 1963-64 season but played only five games taking his final tally of Football League appearances to 352. A wing-half, capable of playing at full-back, centre-half or inside-forward, he was never booked throughout his long career. Bill later became the Director of Physical Education at Birmingham University and in 1974 was elected on to the Sports Council. He was awarded the OBE for his services to sport in 1982 and in the 1998 Birthday Honours’ List he was honoured with a CBE. He was President of British Gymnastics at the time and his daughter Barbara was an Olympic gymnast, representing Great Britain at Montreal in 1976.

Being a better short and middle distance skater, Smuda did not benefit from the re-introduction of the 5,000 metres into women’s all-round competition in the early 1980’s. She did reach the final distance twice in the World Championships (15th in 1980) and three times at the Europeans (13th in 1983). Her four participations in the World Sprint Championships yielded two 11th places, in 1983 and 1984. Smuda was also on the Olympic team in 1980 and 1984.

Champion of Poland at the javelin in both 1934 and 1935 he recorded a throw of 73.27 in the early summer of 1936 that established him as one the favourites for Berlin. A shoulder injury incurred shortly before the Olympic Games hampered him and he could only finish 7th as a throw of 71m claimed the Olympic title. His shoulder never recovered enough for him to return to serious athletics despite an attempted comeback. He was also a national champion at gymnastics in 1934 and 1935. Conscripted into the Polish Army in 1939 Lokajski served as an infantry commander and was taken prisoner by Soviet forces during the Siege of Brest-Litovsk. He escaped from his captors and returned to his hometown of Warszawa where he ran a photographic business. He worked as a teacher in one of the illegal “underground universities” set up by the resistance before taking over his late brother’s responsibilities transporting arms and munitions. Lokajski commanded his own platoon of soldiers during the uprising, under the code name “Brok”, but he was also charged by his commanding officer to use his talents as a photographer and record the events in the streets of Warszawa and he also provided portraits of resistance fighter for use of fake documents. He died in 1944 when caught in an artillery barrage during a trip to collect photographic materials. His body was only found in 1945 after the end of the war.

He also made an appearance for Canada at the 1993 World Junior Championships during this time and took home a gold medal from the tournament, a feat that he would repeat at a higher level at the 1997 World Championships. In his final year with the Petes, 1993, he claimed the Max Kaminsky Trophy as the league’s top defenseman in addition to recognition as the top defenseman in the nation, and was drafted by the National Hockey League’s Hartford Whalers. After only two seasons, however, he was traded to the league’s St. Louis Blues, where he spent the longest portion of his career (1995-2004) and also had a considerable stint as captain (1997-2003). His experiences with the team ranged from suffering cardiac arrest on the ice during the 1998 playoffs to skating with Team Canada at the 1998 and 2002 Winter Olympics. At the former he suited up for six matches and did not reach the podium but, at the latter, he played in the same number of games and took home one of Canada’s first Olympic gold medals in ice hockey in fifty years. He also won the James Norris Memorial Trophy as top defenseman and the Hart Memorial Trophy as league MVP in 2000. After the 2004-2005 NHL lockout he was sent to the NHL’s Edmonton Oilers and he later made an appearance at the 2006 Winter Olympics scoring one goal in six games, but coming home without a medal. In 2007 during his first season with the NHL’s Anaheim Ducks, however, he won the Stanley Cup Championship with his team.

921138,Johan van Hell,Male,28 February 1889,,, Netherlands,NED,"Johan Van Hell was a Dutch visual artist and musician. Even as a young boy he knew that he wanted to combine these two art directions during his lifetime, as he stated: “I want to become an artist and a musician and I want to pursue both careers with all my strength.” There then followed periods of almost frantic painting juxtaposed with periods of mostly music making. Beginning in 1909, and throughout his life, he taught both music and art. Both of his wives shared his passion; the first one, Paulina “Pau” Wijnman (1889-1930), was a skillful artist and the second one, Caroline Lankhout (1895–1947), was a concert pianist. Both wives also shared his devotion to the socialist cause. In music he learned to play clarinet and experimented in music ranging from baroque to jazz. He often played with smaller ensembles and, in later years, he loved chamber music. He mostly painted oil portraits of friends and family members, landscapes, and views from his apartment, but some were in watercolor. From 1925 he adopted geometric approaches to show his social messages depicted in the features of the persons he painted. Poverty and hopelessness were reflected in the faces of his protagonists. During that time he also produced lithographs. The terrible years before and during WWII – as his second wife had a Jewish father – saw decreased production of his works, but after the war he again produced his captivating art. In 1952 he died after a severe kidney infection complicated by his fragile diabetes. In 2005 at Arnhem the exhibition “Van de Straat,” featuring the major work of van Hell, brought him full recognition in the Netherlands. Van Hell painted Schaatsenrijders (oil on canvas) in 1919, viewing from his house in East Amsterdam overlooking the now fully built-up Watergraafsmeer. It is a modern version of the medieval ice scenes by Hendrick Avercamp (1585–1634). The painting is in the collection of the Museum Petit Palais in Geneva.",

Every year between then and 1928, she won a Sussex title as either a junior or senior. As a 15-year-old in 1922, she won the junior and senior southern area 100 yards freestyle titles, both in record times. Tanner obtained her first ASA podium in 1923, finishing third in the 220 free. She was second in the 100 yards the following year and was a member of the British 4x100 metres freestyle silver medal-winning relay team, with Florence Barker, Connie Jeans and Grace McKenzie, at the 1924 Paris Olympics. One of the members of the winning USA team was Trudy Ederle, who Tanner accompanied on Ederle’s unsuccessful attempt at swimming the English Channel in 1925. Apart from finishing second in the ASA 440 yards and National Long-distance Championship in 1925, and the latter again in 1926, Tanner’s career suffered a decline. With another Olympics looming, however, her form picked up, earning her a second Olympic selection, and she won yet another 4x100 free relay silver medal, this time with Joyce Cooper, Cissie Stewart and Ellen King. Tanner also reached the 400 free final, finishing sixth. She followed her Olympic appearance by springing a major surprise in beating Cooper and King to win the ASA 100 yards title shortly after the Amsterdam Games, and in record time. Tanner also finished second in the ASA 220 and 440 that year. Tanner toured South Africa with a Great Britain ladies team in 1929 and re-met Dupre Murrell, who she originally met at the Paris Olympics, when he accompanied the South African men’s team. Murrell and Tanner married in South Africa in April 1930 and she continued her career as a teacher at Grahamstown. She retired from swimming in 1934 but had taken up golf in 1931, and a little over two years later won the South African East Province Championship. Tanner moved to Hong Kong in the late 1930s and worked for the Hong Kong Education Department. During the War, she enrolled as a nurse in the Auxiliary Nursing Service (ANS), and consequently missed the compulsory evacuation of women and children. She later became a Japanese prisoner-of-war, interned at the Stanley Camp in Hong Kong. She was released in 1945 and on return to England, married her second husband, lieutenant colonel Ned Curran.",

Gueldry studied at the École des Beaux Arts and later at the Académie Julian in Paris. A scholarship allowed him to travel to numerous European countries. He mainly painted oils of working class, historical and water sports scenes. In 1908 he was appointed Knight of the Legion of Honor and in 1915 became the official painter of the Museé de l’Armée in Paris. At the end of the 1930s he emigrated to Switzerland. Born into a wealthy family, like his brother Victor he was also an avid rower, a hobby that became one of his main painting subjects. Gueldry was one of the first members of the Société Nautique de la Marne. An international referee in that sport, Gueldry had several opportunities to cross the Channel towards England and participate in the famous Henley Regatta. In 1912 he took part in the paintings category in the art competitions at Stockholm.

He took an early interest in art despite his father’s urging to become a lawyer. After attending Kawabata Painting School in Tokyo, Sato studied at the Western Painting Department of School of Fine Arts beginning in 1926. In the following years he took part successfully in the Emperor and the Dai Nibu-kai Exhibitions. In 1930-34 he continued his studies at the Académie Calarossi in Paris, where he was soon accepted for the Salon d’Automne. In 1936 he was one of the founders of the Shinseisaku-ha-kyôkai (New Creation Group). He was married to singer Yoshiko Sato, but she chose to stay in Japan while he lived in Paris. During World War II, he joined the military news department, with Inokuma Genichiro, to record battles in paintings. In 1944, he was evacuated to Tsukui in Kanagawa prefecture together with several other artists. In 1952 Sato moved permanently to Paris and visited his home country only sporadically thereafter. His wife was the famous opera singer Yoshiko Sato (1903-1982), but he separated from her because she refused to accompany him to Paris. While living there, Sato also turned from a concrete to an abstract style of painting. He was in the second wave of Japanese artists painting in lyric abstraction. Sato travelled frequently to Greece, Italy, North Africa, Great Britain, and the USA. He exhibited world-wide, for instance, in 1958 at the 30th Biennale in Venice and in the following year at the 6th Japanese International Art Exhibition. Sato died at his home in Beppu from acute heart failure. In February 1949, Asahi Weekly published a graphic by Kei Sato on its cover depicting a skier. It cannot be proven whether this was his 1936 entry, however, which was a graphic, after all.",

He played in eight games and scored one goal, but a loss to the Soviet Union in the final left the team in fourth place after the tiebreaking rules were applied, although they earned World Championship bronze medals as this tournament had different tiebreaking rules. After coming home empty-handed again in 1965, the Canadians won bronze medals at the 1966 and 1967 World Championships, as well as the 1968 Winter Olympics. In the latter, MacKenzie played in seven matches and did not score any goals.

In 1961 he turned professional and joined Bologna FC, playing for them through 1967. Denmark did not allow professionals to play on their national team in that era, so that effectively ended Nielsen’s international career. After leaving Bologna FC, Nielsen played three more years, one each with Internazionale FC, SSC Napli, and Sampdoria, and then retired. Nielsen’s post-sports career was equally successful. He married well-known actress Rudi Hansen in 1963 and together they started a company importing Italian leather works to Scandanavia.

By 1982, however, he had decided to pursue cycling as a career and, one year later, he was representing Canada at the Pan American Games, finishing 4th in the sprint. The podium did not elude him at the 1984 Summer Olympics, as he captured silver behind Fredy Schmidtke of West Germany in the 1,000 metres time trial. He won his first major international title at the 1987 Pan American Games, in the 1,000m time trial, as well as a bronze medal in the sprint. He returned to the Olympics the following year, but placed 11th among 30 competitors in the 1,000m time trial and did not leave his opening heat in the sprint. Harnett had placed 6th in the sprint at the 1986 Commonwealth Games, but earned silver at the 1990 edition, a feat that he would repeat in 1994. He also won his first World Championship medal, silver in the sprint, in 1990. Although he was 4th in the event the following year, he managed to capture bronze at the 1992 Summer Olympics, behind German Jens Fiedler and Australian Gary Neiwand.

In 1936 Eisenmenger won a silver medal in the art competitions of the Olympic Games for his work Läufer vor dem Ziel (Runners at the Finishing Line). It was painted in 1936 in oil on canvas. For a selling price of RM 2,200.00, the painting was purchased by the Museum of Art and Sport in Tokyo. In 1938, the painting was reproduced in color in the Olympic Review. However, it seems to have been a copy in a slightly different style compared to the picture in the art catalog. From 1939-45 he was President of the Vienna Künstlerhaus. In this role, Eisenmenger actively espoused for Jewish artists and the salvation of their works, although himself a member of the Nazi Party. After World War II he continued to work successfully in Vienna and won, among other awards, the competition for the design of the iron curtain of the Vienna State Opera.

She won several local marathons and ran her Personal Best of 2:48:32 in 1983 at the California International Marathon in Sacramento.

She finished with a time of 2:51:35, and became Bolivia’s first women Olympic athlete. In 1985 Chávez de Wright competed for Bolivia in both the World Cup Marathon in Hiroshima, Japan and the women’s marathon at the 1987 Pan-American Games in Indianapolis, Indiana, where she finished sixth.

After World War II, he played for Harringay Racers in the National League, before joining Earl’s Court Rangers. He spent most of his time with them as a reserve, but his services were required by Brighton Tigers, Nottingham Panthers, and the newly re-formed Earl’s Court Marlboroughs in the 1949/50 season. At the 1948 Olympics, Simon kept goal in all eight of Great Britain’s matches. After a 16-year career, he retired from the sport in 1953. After the war, because of financial restrictions, it was not possible for British ice hockey teams to import good quality sticks from North America so Simon, a cabinet maker by trade, along with former player Freddie Dunkelman, came up with an idea of using laminated wood to replace traditional hickory-based sticks as made in Britain at the time. They made their sticks from a factory in Battersea, which were distributed to clubs in England, Scotland, and Europe.",

Between these two appearances he had the best mark of his career in 1927 when he jumped 26-2¼ (7.98), but the mark was not recognized as a world record, because the take-off board was one inch higher than the landing pit.

Scott was less than three-years-of-age when his father died. In fact, shortly before his death, his father told his mother, the sculptor Kathleen Scott, to make sure their son became interested in natural history, which he did and the younger Scott went on to become a champion for wildlife conservation. The godson of Peter Pan creator J. M. Barrie, Scott was educated at Oundle School and then Trinity College, Cambridge. It was while still an undergraduate that Scott was first attracted to wildfowl and wildfowling, and showed a great ability as a painter of geese and ducks. In the 1930s he also wrote several books about wildfowl. During World War II, Scott served as a lieutenant-commander with the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve and was three times mentioned in dispatches, and honoured with the DSC (Distinguished Service Cross) and Bar. Having assembled his own collection of wildfowl before the War, Scott set up the Severn Wildfowl Trust (now known as the Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust) in 1945 with probably the finest collection of wildfowl ever accumulated. Scott joined the Council of the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Reserves in 1960, and from 1963-85 was chairman of their Commission that looked after endangered species. In 1961 Scott helped found World Wildlife Fund (WWF), serving as chairman from its formation until 1982, and was responsible for the design of its famous panda logo. For more than 25 years, Peter Scott was a television personality thanks to the wildlife programme Look that he presented from his Gloucestershire home from 1955-81. It was the first nature programme on BBC television, and was an inspiration to children and adults of the era. His television work was pioneering and inspired the likes of Sir David Attenborough. Setting conservation and television aside, Scott was also a competent sportsman. He was a keen and successful yachtsman and glider. He was the national gliding champion in 1963 and was a notable dinghy sailor, winning the International 14-foot Championship for the Prince of Wales Cup three times, in 1937-38, and 1946. He also won a bronze medal at the 1936 Olympics. Scott was president of the International Yacht Racing Union (now World Sailing) from 1955-69. Scott was also a championship-standard figure skater. He was knighted in 1973, and made a Companion of Honour and a Fellow of the Royal Society, both in 1987.",Listed in Olympians and IOC Members Serving as President of an International Federation (IF) (ISAF (IYRU) president 1955-1969) Listed in Olympian Members of the Nobility (Sir)

The event was later cancelled, however, following a dispute between the organisers and the Transvaal Farmer’s Association. Both men were then invited to run in the marathon at the St. Louis Games.

Between the two World Wars he lived abroad except for a brief return to Sydney in London. The gay de Mestre changed his name during this time because of his alleged relationship with the French philosopher Joseph de Maistre. Roy de Maistre is still regarded as one of the most important Australian born painters of his era. His father Étienne was a well-known thoroughbred racehorse trainer. The title of the submitted work appears in different versions. In the art catalog as Rugby Football or Footballers; the correct title is probably The Football Match.

He returned south after completing his education and joined the Thames Rowing Club in 1908, where he enjoyed a highly successful career. Logan also enjoyed two other successful sporting careers as a boxer and member of the Richmond RUFC. Logan was in the Thames four that won the Stewards’ Challenge Cup at Henley in 1909 and 1911 and, in the latter year, Logan and Charles Rought dead-heated with Julius Beresford and Arthur Cloutte in the semi-final of the Silver Goblets. Their time was a course record 8:08, which would stand until 1934. The two crews tossed a coin to see who progressed to the final. Beresford and Cloutte won, and also went on to win the title. Compensation came the following year for Logan and Rought, as they were the victors. The duo, along with Julius Beresford, Karl Vernon and Geoffrey Carr, also made up the Thames coxed fours that won the silver medal for Great Britain at the Stockholm Olympics. Having rowed in the Grand Challenge eights for the Thames Club at Henley many times since 1908, Logan won his first eights trophy at Henley when he was in the Thames crew that won the Fawley Cup at the Victory Regatta in 1919. Two years later, Logan and Ian Fairbairn were runners-up in the Silver Goblets. In addition to his excellent rowing career, Bruce Logan was a forward for the Richmond rugby club and, as a boxer, was runner-up in the 1910 ABA heavyweight final, losing to South Africa’s Fred Storbeck when the referee stopped the fight after Logan was floored six times in the first two rounds. Having joined the London Scottish Rifle Volunteers as a cadet in 1903, Logan was commissioned into the Duke of Lancaster’s Own Yeomanry during World War I and was awarded the British War Medal and British Victory Medal. During the fighting he was in charge of the Boxing Platoon that entertained the troops by giving exhibition bouts. After the hostilities, Logan had the honour of captaining the British Army to victory in the newly inaugurated Kings Trophy boxing tournament in 1918. It was a competition open to servicemen from Great Britain, the Commonwealth (represented by teams from Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and South Africa), and the United States of America. Logan’s team won the trophy with 50 points, 11 ahead of second-placed USA. Later in life Logan, who reached the rank of colonel, worked for the Army Welfare Office and, after his competitive career as a rower and boxer, remained in contact with both sports in an administrative capacity. Having earlier worked in the insurance business he later became a director of a shipping company.",

In 1936, she won the Olympic gold, although she would have placed second by modern-day rules. Together with Dorothy Odam and Elfriede Kaun, Csák had cleared 1.60 (in two tries, compared to one for Odam) and failed at 1.62. In the tie-breaker for the medals, Csák was the only to clear 1.62, taking home the gold. Two years later, Csák would win her second international title in an even more unusual fashion. She originally placed second at the European Championships behind Germany’s Dora Ratjen, who, on the ride home after victory, was uncovered as a man (though raised as a girl) and subsequently disqualified. Csák retired from sports in 1939, having won seven consecutive Hungarian titles in the high jump (1933-39) as well as two in the long jump (1937, 1939). She later worked for the Hungarian Banknote Printing Corporation as a receptionist.

Between 1896-1902 he studied at the Prague College of Industrial Art, where he later became a professor. Later he established his own sculpting studio in Prague. Drahoňovský began as a sculptor in marble, bronze, and ceramics and turned to glass work after 1920 but, at the same time, he applied himself to fine-glass engraving. He also became known as a stone cutter of semi-precious stones in the tradition of his homeland. The glass engravings by Drahoňovský were among the most important in the country in the first half of the century. His styles went from Art Deco to Neoclassicism. The three sculptures he submitted to the Art Competitions in 1932 at Los Angeles in the Sculpture Category were also glass works. He designed two glassworks for Sokol meetings. One of them dates from 1938, the other one from 1926, and only the latter can be considered as the entry for the 1932 art competitions. There are also two similar versions of a vase or a cup with the Archer’s motif. These may be the two respective works entered.",

He also bettered the old record on five other occasions, although these marks were not recognized because of various irregularities. The highlight of the season was a jump of 24-11¾ (7.61) off a board runway at Ball’s Bridge, Dublin, on 5 August, which was subsequently recognized as the first official IAAF record. It remained on the books for 20 years and was not beaten as an Irish All-Comers record until 1968. O’Connor also won the first of six consecutive AAA long jump titles in 1901. He was also the high jump champion in 1903 and 1904, when he shared the title in a three-way tie with John Milne, and R G Murray. In the long jump at the 1906 Olympics O’Connor had trouble with his run-up, which resulted in a fierce dispute with the judges. They repeatedly called him for “no-jumping” and he finished in second place with a mark more than one foot below his best. Frustrated by this result, O’Connor turned to his secondary event, the triple jump, in search of a gold medal. On paper his fellow-Irishman Cornelius “Con” Leahy, the newly-crowned high jump champion and an excellent all-round jumper, was the favorite, but things went well for O’Connor and he finally won an Olympic gold medal. The Games did not go without controversy for O’Connor and his fellow Irish team-mates Leahy, John Daly and John McGough. All four went to the Games with the support of the Irish Athletic Association and GAA (Gaelic Athletic Association) and they believed they were representing Ireland. But when they got to Athens they were listed as representing Great Britain and Ireland. At the long jump medal ceremony O’Connor, already angry at the judging in the event, staged a protest by climbing up the flag pole and pulling down the British flag and hoisting the Irish one in its place in what is regarded as the first of many political protests in the long history of the Olympic Games. O’Connor retired at the end of the 1906 season and concentrated on his solicitor’s practice, Peter O’Connor and Sons which was still going strong in Waterford more 100 years later, but he maintained a keen interest in the sport and was one of the judges at the 1932 Olympic Games in Los Angeles. He was also a spectator at the 1936 Games and press interviews at the time revealed that his style of jumping was remarkably similar to that of Jesse Owens, the winner at the Berlin Olympics.
