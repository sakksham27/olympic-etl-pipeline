920679,Theodor Nußbaum,Male,3 July 1885,,, Germany,GER,"German garden and landscape architect Theodor Nußbaum won a bronze medal for his work Stadtplan Köln: Sportflächen im Stadtgebiet (Town Plan of Cologne – Sport Areas in Cologne) at the 1936 Berlin Olympics within the Art Competitions in the category Architecture, Designs For Town Planning. In total, he submitted eight elements of his project, one of them “hors concours”. He eventually became a municipal construction officer, as a commissioner of city planning in Köln. He first worked in Leipzig for the cemetery administration and since 1910 for the city of Köln, where he was mainly responsible for sports facilities. During World War I Nußbaum worked in Poland designing and building cemeteries, and he became a specialist for cemetery and sports complex design. In 1920 he became head of the design office of the Köln garden administrative, and in 1928 was appointed head of the municipal planning and building control office. In 1933, he applied in vain for the position of the director of the horticultural office, but was deputy head from 1940-45. After World War II he was suspended, probably because of his previous membership in the Nazi Party. Nußbaum designed several structures on the left bank of Köln next to vast meadows and a smaller boat pond, including the Adenauer and the Decksteiner ponds, used for rowing, and two other lakes beyond the Luxemburger Straße, both still existing today. At this outdoor facility he designed the Müngersdorfer Stadion used by football club 1. FC Köln and the German Sports University. His influence in the mid-1930s helping design “Maifeld,” a permanent parade ground at the Aachener Weiher, was the high point of his career. In total, he submitted eight segments of his plan, one of them “hors concours”.",

920813,Jack Yeats,Male,29 August 1871,,, Ireland,IRL,"Jack Butler Yeats was an Irish painter and author. He was the son of the painter John Butler Yeats and a brother of the poet William Butler Yeats, who won the 1923 Nobel Prize for literature. In his early years Jack Yeats worked as an illustrator for newspapers and published his first Sherlock Holmes comic in 1894, but in 1906 he moved to oil painting. At the beginning of 20th century he moved to the USA, returning to Ireland in 1910. At the end of the 1920s he had a close friendship with famous Austrian painter Oskar Kokoschka and in the 1930s began writing novels and dramas. He is widely seen as a “National Painter” for his paintings depicting Irish landscapes, horses, circus and travelling players. His style ranged from conventional landscape style to expressionism, from watercolors with limited range of colours to oil paintings, with thick coats of paint. The work Swimming awarded with silver, actually The Liffey Swim (oil on canvas, 61 x 91 cm), painted by Yeats in 1923, is today in the National Gallery of Ireland. The “Liffey Swim” is a long-distance swim in the river Liffey in Dublin and was first held in 1920. The image shows spectators in the O’Connell Bridge area and was recreated live for the 100th edition in 2019. The painter is said to have immortalized himself and his wife among the spectators. A smaller (46 x 61 cm) oil painting is Before the Start, which shows three jockeys before a race. The 1915 painting is in the National Gallery as well. The The Small Ring, also an oil painting, is part of the inventory of the Crawford Art Gallery in Cork. The 61.0 x 91.5 cm sized painting was created in 1930, probably from sketches made in 1908.","Listed in Olympians With Nobel Prizes or Related to Nobel Prize Winners (Brother of William Butler Yeats, who won the 1923 Nobel Prize in Literature.)"

He was one of the leading impressionist landscape painters of the first half of 20th century. He was also known for his golfing, equestrian, and hunting scenes. Young was born into a wealthy family and did not need to sell his paintings to survive, but was still a member of the international art community. Young was a student and award-winning artist at the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts, and later, after having worked as an art teacher, at the Académie Colarossi in Paris. Further spells in France followed until 1905. From 1917 he lived in Radnor near Philadelphia and spent the summers in Maine. His paintings won medals and were exhibited not only in shows and galleries across the United States but in places such as Buenos Aires; Amsterdam, Netherlands; Budapest, Hungary, and Santiago, Chile. In 1962, a fire destroyed his home and around 200 of his paintings. Although he tried to repaint many of them, he died only two years later. Young submitted a total of five oil paintings and three etchings. On Darby Creek was featured in the 1928 catalog. Darby Creek, a tributary of the Delaware River in Pennsylvania, is a motif that appears in several of his paintings. The works submitted in 1932 were created during invitations to hunt in the rural area west of Philadelphia. This is implied by the place names such as White Horse and Echo Valley. Huntsman and Hounds (Echo Valley) was painted starting in 1929, Brown’s Meadow in 1932 (both in oil on canvas, 63.5 x 76, 2 cm). Similar motifs showed his etchings, including The Hounds at White Horse and White Horse Blacksmith Shop from 1925/26 about 20 x 23 cm in size. These possibly served as templates for his paintings.",

He produced mainly large sculptures and reliefs. After World War II, he first devoted himself to watercolor painting but then went back to sculpture from 1950 onwards. In the 1980s and 1990s Vignoli again created sporting motifs, including bronze statues of tennis player Björn Borg and the motorcyclist Giacomo Agostini. He also created several portraits of American actors. He was involved in the planning of an architectural complex for the Art Academy of Bologna at the end of the 1950s. Vignoli had a widespread palette of art activities during his life. Vignoli was awarded the gold medal at the 1936 Berlin Olympics in the Art Competitions in the category Sculpturing, Statues, for his work Guidatore di Sulky (The Sulky Driver), which had already been presented at the Quadriennale in Milano the previous year. Although Arno Breker’s Decathlete was the heavy favorite, the jury finally decided in favor of the Sulky Driver because it was considered less aesthetic but more in line with the requirements of the regulations. Possibly they also wanted to oppose Hitler’s attempts to exert influence. After the Olympic Games, the sculpture was bought by the Japanese baron Morimura and is shown today in the Tokyo National Museum.",

She clearly touched Zhang, who later claimed she had been grabbed, but the referees missed the incident and allowed Turner to win the gold ahead of Zhang. Dissatisfied with the incident, the Chinese skater stormed away from the podium as soon as the “Star Spangled Banner” had finished - to the dislike of the IOC. The incident did eventually lead to referees being allowed to use television replays in the sport. Zhang’s other Olympic appearances weren’t particularly lucky either, finishing 4th in the 1994 1,000 m and 1988 relay (when the sport was still a demonstration event) and suffering two disqualifications with the relay team in 1992 and 1994.

Eschewing the normal route of immediate pro stardom, he instead accepted a Rhodes Scholarship to study at Oxford. While at Oxford he played occasional basketball in European leagues and found that he missed the competition of top-flight basketball. Bradley joined the New York Knicks in the middle of the 1968 amidst much media hoopla. He was basically a disappointment that first season and it was attributed to the fact that, at 6-5 (1.95) and of only average speed, he fit in at neither guard nor forward. Eventually Bradley became a star in the NBA but not of the individual variety. Never an All-Star or an outstanding one-on-one player, he became the consummate team player and helped the New York Knicks to win two NBA championships. After an 11-year pro career, all with the Knicks, he retired in 1977. Bradley’s accomplishments did not end with professional sports. He later served three terms for the state of New Jersey as a U.S. Senator from 1978-1996. In 2000, he ran unsuccessfully for the Democratic nomination as U.S. President. He has since served as a corporate consultant and investment banker.","Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the Summer Universiade (1–0–0 1965 Budapest BAS gold) Listed in Olympians Who Ran for President of the United States (POTUS) (Bradley was a US Senator for three terms from 1978-1996 for the state of New Jersey.

Fonbæk showed an early talent for long-distance running. At age 20, he ran 4:32.6 for 1,500 metres and 16:45.6 for 5,000 metres, second best in Norway that season for both distances. In 1908 he was second at the Norwegian Championships at 5,000 m and third at 1,500 m, but only the winner Nils Dahl was selected for the London Olympics in the longer distances. Fonbæk later specialized in marahon running. In 1911 he did 3-01:18 in a 40.2 km track race, and in the selection race for the Stockholm Games in Kristiania (16 June 2012), he won in a time of 2-44:30, winning by over 10 minutes. The top three, all timed under 3 hours for the 40.2 km course, were selected for the Stockholm Olympics.

Upon his demobilization in 1946, he joined Hamilton, Ontario’s Leander Boat Club and took up the sport once more. In 1948, as national champions, the team was chosen to represent Canada at that year’s Summer Olympics, where Griffiths was eliminated in the semi-finals alongside Peter Green, Robert Christmas, Alfred Stefani, Marvin Hammond, Jack Zwierewich, Bill McConnell, Ron Cameron, and Walt Robertson. Four years later, he was a member of the Leander squad that won the Canadian championships in the coxless fours. This led to his second Olympic appearance at the 1952 Games, where, with Zwierewich, Cameron, and Lloyd Montour, he was eliminated in the round one repêchage.

69250,Mike Lindsay,Male,2 November 1938,189.0,113, Great Britain,GBR,"At the age of 11, Glasgow-born Mike Lindsay moved to London when his father retired from the Army to take up a position with the Post Office. Mike attended St. Marylebone Grammar School and was a good all-round sportsman, particularly at athletics, cricket and rugby. It was here that his athletics coach convinced him to make the switch from running to throwing turn to throwing, and in 1956 he was the AAA junior shot and discus champion. He retained both titles the following year when he also won his first senior title (discus) while still a junior. Between 1959-69 Lindsay had seven podium finishes in the shot at the AAA Championships, winning it in 1959. He also enjoyed another seven podium finishes in the discus (1957-67) but, in contrast, won it three times, in 1957, 1959-60. Lindsay also won two indoor AAA shot titles, in 1964 and 1966. In 1963 he became the first Scot to put the shot over 60 feet (18.3m), and that same year enjoyed one of his finest moments when, in the match between Great Britain and the USA at the White City, he beat the future Olympic shot champion Randy Matson into second place. Although he competed in four Commonwealth Games (1958-70) and two Olympics (1960-64), Lindsay’s only international medals were silver. Firstly, at the 1962 British Empire and Commonwealth Games at Perth, Australia, he came second in both the shot and discus, losing the fomer by just 4cm. The following year, at the Summer Universiade in Brazil, he again won silver in both events. When he finished fifth at the 1960 Roma Olympics, it was the highest-ever finish by a British-born shot putter. Although it was subsequently equalled by Geoff Capes at Moskva in 1980, it still stood as the best by a Briton going into the 2020 Games. In the late 1950s, Lindsay was one of the first British athletes to obtained a sports scholarship to the United States. He attended Oklahoma State University where he competed alongside the best of American throwers like Parry O’Brien and Al Oerter. After completing his education in the US, Lindsay became a teacher at the Carnegie Physical Education College in Leeds before studying for a mechanical engineering degree at Leeds University, which led to him studying biomechanics within physical education, and was involved in lectures on the subject at various academies around Britain. Between 1979-2004 Lindsay was the director of PE at Leeds University. When he retired from competitive sport in 1971, Lindsay had won both the Scottish shot and discus titles for a record 15 consecutive years, and between 1957-71 had won more than 35 international caps for Scotland and Great Britain. His older brother Chris was also a good standard athlete, and was a former Scottish 220 and 440 champion and also a “B” international. After retiring from athletics, Mike enjoyed playing squash, golf and badminton, and was also a keen orienteer.

Although an American citizen he spent much time overseas and in Paris for his career as an artist. Still in New York, he began an apprenticeship as an engraver with the American Banknote Company and at the same time studied at the Brooklyn Art Association and at the National Academy of Design. In 1867 he first went to Paris where he studied in the studio of the noted academic painter Jean-Léon Gérôme (1824-1904), and then made Paris his headquarters. His first major success was the Paris Salon of 1870. He regularly spent summers in Britanny. The Franco-Prussian War interrupted Bridgman’s career and forced him to leave Paris, going first to Brittany, then later to Spain. From there, he also made extensive trips to North Africa, dividing his time between Algeria and Egypt between 1872 and 1874, where he executed over 300 sketches, which became source material for his later oil paintings. He visited North Africa in the later 1870s and 1880s. He was known as “the American Gérôme” but would later adopt a naturalistic aesthetic, emphasizing bright colors and painterly brushwork. During these trips, he also discovered photography. John Singer Sargent said that Bridgman’s studio was one of Paris’s must-see attractions. He remained popular as an orientalist painter in the United States and had one-man shows in 1890 at New York’s 5th Avenue Galleries and at The Art Institute of Chicago. In 1907, Bridgman was appointed Officer of the Legion of Honor. After World War I, his fame began to fade and was unable to repeat his former success with his paintings. He retired to Lyon-la-Forêt in Normandy with his second wife.",

During their time in Hungary József started with judo in the colors of Bp. Honvéd but could not find a suitable affiliation in Denmark. As a result of a Bruce Lee film, he switched sports and chose the traditional Korean martial art of taekwondo. As it turned out later, he made the right decision, as he won 13 Danish (1983-95) and one Hungarian (1996) Championships, also winning one junior (1984) and three senior European Championships (1986, 1990, 1992). In 1992 Salim took part in the Barcelona Olympics in Danish colors, where the sport was still a demonstration sport, and in 2000 competed for Hungary, when the sport was included on the Olympic Program for the first time.

Her international début came at the 1996 Pan American Junior Championships. As a senior she first competed internationally at the 1998 Goodwill Games, winning a silver medal on the uneven bars. Ray was the highest ranked American at the 1999 World Championships, placing eighth in the all-around. Ray won the US Championships and the Olympic Trials in 2000, and at Sydney qualified for the beam event final, placing eighth. She struggled in the all-around which she attributed to a problem with the height of the vault, which was set incorrectly. She fell on both her warm-up and competition vaults, nearly landing on her head on one vault. Officials noticed later that the vault was 5 cm too high, not having been re-set after the men’s event, and allowed competitors to re-do their vaults, which Ray did but she still ended up 13th in the vault and was affected throughout the competition. Ray and the USA women’s team at Sydney initially placed fourth in the team competition. However, it was discovered in 2010 that a member of the Chinese team, Dong Fangxiao, had competed under a falsified age, and was too young for the competition. Her results were nullified and China was stripped of the bronze medal, advancing the United States to third place. The US women were given their bronze medals at a special ceremony prior to the men’s event at the 2010 US Championships. After the tumultuous Sydney gymnastics competition Ray enrolled at the University of Michigan, where she competed on their gym team through 2005, winning three NCAA individual titles, in the 2001 all-around, the 2002 beam, and the 2004 uneven bars. She also performed for three years in Cirque du Soleil in Las Vegas. Ray went into coaching, first at the Carroll Gymnastics Center in Hampstead, Maryland. In 2011 she became an assistant coach at the University of Washington, becoming the head coach in 2016. Ray resigned that position in 2020 when she and her family moved from the Seattle area.",

Gandil played for three football clubs in København, starting his career with ØB, before moving to KB, and finishing his career with B.93. At the age of 20 Gandil was one of the co-founders of B.93 in 1893, with the club originally being formed as a cricket club. Two years after its formation football was added to the club’s programme with Gandil playing for the side for the rest of his career until 1909. During this time he played in 82 matches for the team and scored 81 goals. B.93 won the København Championship (“Københavnsmesterskabet i fodbold”) six times while Gandil played for them, with him being the Championship’s top goal scorer on seven occasions. At the 1908 London Olympics Gandil played in his one and only match for the Danish national football team. After Denmark beat France B 9–0 in the opening round of the tournament Gandil played in the semi-final match, which saw the Danes thrash the France A side 17–1. Gandil was 35 years and 154 days old when he made his début for Denmark, a record that stood until goalkeeper Peter Kjær made his international début in April 2001 at the age of 35 years and 171 days.

With the Celeste jersey he won, all as captain, two Olympic titles (1924, 1928), four Copa Américas (1923-24, 1926, 1935), four Copa Liptons (1923-24, 1927, 1929), two Copa Newtons (1929-30), and the 1930 FIFA World Cup. These victories made him the footballer with the most international titles achieved with his national team, on par with his compatriots Héctor Scarone and Ángel Romano. Domestically Nasazzi played with Lito (1910-20), Rolando Moor (1921), Bella Vista (1922-32), and finally Nacional Montevideo (1932-38), winning two national titles. The 850 matches he played in the Uruguayan Top League remain a record as of 2023. After retiring from active competition, Nasazzi became a coach, leading the Uruguayan national team for three years, from 1942-45. After Mariscal’s death from esophageal cancer, Club Atlético Bella Vista dedicated their stadium to him, the José Nasazzi Stadium in Montevideo. In 2001, on the centenary of his birth, the Uruguayan Post issued a stamp in his honor.","Listed in Olympic Footballers - Gold Medalists and World Cup Champions, Men (Olympic Gold - 1924/1928; World Cup Champion - 1930.)"

102,Algernon Kingscote,Male,3 February 1888,,, Great Britain,GBR,"The Kingscote family pedigree goes back to 985 AD and the family home at Kingscote Manor in Gloucestershire was mentioned in the Domesday Book. The son of Colonel Howard Kingscote, Algernon, or Algy as he was widely known, was born in India and learned to play tennis in Switzerland where he and his mother lived. In 1908, at the age of 20, he won the Swiss championship just days after the sudden death of his mother, the writer “Lucas Cleeve”. He then joined the Royal Garrison Artillery and rose to the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel. He served in both World Wars, was mentioned in dispatches three times, and was awarded the 1914 Star and Military Cross. Despite being over the age of 30 when competitive tennis resumed after the First World War, Algy was regarded as one of the finest male players in Great Britain. He made his Wimbledon début in 1914 but the war years curtailed his appearances, and he took part on just six more occasions up to 1927, reaching the All-comers’ singles final in 1919 before losing to Australian Gerald Patterson. However, he won his first and only Grand Slam title six months later when he beat local favourite Eric Pockley to win the Australian championship. A week earlier he had captained Great Britain in the Davis Cup final in Sydney which Australia won 4-1. He appeared in three other Davis Cups, in 1920, 1922 and 1924. Kingscote and James Parke were beaten in the 1920 Wimbledon doubles final by Dick Williams, who learned his tennis in Switzerland alongside Algy, and his fellow American Chuck Garland. Two years later Algy had the distinction of winning the first ever match on Wimbledon’s centre court after the championship moved to its new home at Church Road. He beat Leslie Godfree in straight sets. At the 1924 Olympic Games Kingscote appeared in the men’s doubles and singles where he made it to the last 16 but was heavily beaten 6-1, 6-3, 6-1 by Frenchman Jean Borotra. The captain of the British International Tennis Club four times between 1925-32 he also served as Chairman of the club for nearly 25 years.",

In the late 1990s he began curling out of New Brunswick and won six additional provincial titles (1999-2000, 2002-2004, 2009) as skip, but the closest he came to capturing a national title was in 2000, when he was runner-up. Perhaps the peak of his career, however, came when he skipped Brad Gushue’s rink at the 2005 Olympic trial, although Gushue continued to throw the fourth stone, typically reserved for the skip, and had Howard throw the second. Their victory at this event earned them right to represent Canada at the 2006 Winter Olympics, where they won the nation’s first gold medal in men’s curling at the tournament. Howard, who turned 50 during the event, became the oldest Canadian and first from New Brunswick to win a gold at the Games. As of 2009, when he is not curling, he works as a motivational speaker across Canada, a real estate agent for RE/MAX, a part-time commentator with The Sports Network (since 2001), and curling coach in Switzerland. In 2006 he was made a member of the New Brunswick Sports Hall of Fame and in 2007 his autobiography “Hurry Hard: The Russ Howard Story” was released. He is also the developer of the “Moncton Rule”, which eventually involved into the “four-rock” or “free guard zone” rule, a modern staple of international curling tournaments. The latter states that until the first two rocks from each side have been played, rocks in the free guard zone cannot be knocked out of play by an opponent’s stone, or else they are replaced and the rock that hit them is removed from play. Howard’s modified version, which set the threshold at three rocks instead of four, was used in Canada for many years prior to their switch to the Moncton Rule.",Grandnephew of Jenny Thompson Brother of Glenn Howard Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the World Curling Championships (2–0–0 1987 Vancouver gold: team; 1993 Genève gold: team)

Tarzan Brown ran his first important race in 1933 at the Boston Marathon, finishing 32nd. After repeating that finish in 1934, he expected better results in 1935. But the race was only two days after his mother’s death and he ran in a shirt made from one of her dresses. His shoes fell apart at 21 miles, and he finished barefoot in 13th place. But by 1936, he was well known, and was sponsored by the Tercentenary Committee of Providence. Able to train without working or financial worries, Brown won the 1936 Boston Marathon by almost two minutes, leading at all checkpoints. The victory qualified him for the 1936 U.S. Olympic team. At Berlin, Brown was injured with a hernia, but he started the marathon and ran with the leaders for 30 km., although he failed to finish. Later in 1936, Tarzan Brown won the venerable Port Chester marathon in 2-36:56.7. On the next day, 12 October 1936, he won a second marathon in as many days, winning the New England Marathon Championship in Manchester, New Hampshire. Brown did not fare as well in 1937, racing poorly at Boston and finishing 31st. The next year was even worse, as he finished the 1938 Boston Marathon in 51st place, running only 3-38:59. But he did finish the year by winning the AAU 25 kilometre title. And at the AAU Championships in Yonkers in November, he led for 15 miles, only to fail to finish with abdominal cramps. In 1939, Brown fully regained his previous form, winning Boston in 2-28:51 for a new course and American record and the first time 2½ hours had been bettered on the Boston course. But in 1940, he did not finish the most important American marathon, which was won by the Canadian, Gerard Côté. Côté broke Brown’s course record, but in the next month, at the Lawrence (MA) to Salisbury Beach (NH) marathon, Brown ran his career best time, defeating Côté and the top four finishers from the 1940 Boston, finishing in 2-27:29.6, a new American record for the marathon. He did not retire, finishing Boston in 1943 and 1946, but he was never again of international caliber. Tarzan Brown made his living as a stonemason, and settled near his boyhood home in Charleston, Rhode Island. He died in 1975 when he was struck by a van while he was walking along the street.

Littlefield attended Harvard University, studying art history, life drawing, and art technique and attended technical classes at the Fogg Art Museum. At Harvard, he was influenced by the style of the Impressionist Boston School. He then continued his private lessons with Wolever until 1923. In early October 1924, Littlefield moved to France to study art, spending most of his time in the South of France and Italy (Siena and Firenze) until 1927, then returning to Paris. There, he painted mostly nudes and had his first homosexual relationship. Littlefield returned to the United States in June 1929 and spent the summer painting in Falmouth, on Cape Cod, staying with his parents. He spent the winter of 1929-30 living in Boston, continuing to paint portrait commissions, Cape landscapes, and still lifes. During World War II, he painted murals for the company day room and post headquarters on classical themes, easel paintings incorporating military objects, and stage sets for theater productions. In the 1950s, he considered himself an abstract expressionist and, although he continued to paint primarily nudes, he increasingly painted abstract works. Eventually Littlefield was found lifeless in his home in 1969 after failing to show up for a dinner party. There are several copies of the submitted works all showing boxers in different versions, as drawings (ink), etchings and lithographs. He started the series with boxing motifs in 1927/28 in Paris on behalf of a publisher. Amongst others, a series of six lithographs in the format 66 x 50 cm was published in 1929, possibly including his three entries.",

While his performances were decent, his most remarkable moment at these Games came off the track. After a drink with Dutch prince consort Hendrik (who would later that year open Amsterdam Olympics), Heiden and colleague Kos found the prince drunk and frozen in pile of snow, and they had to rescue him. They were rewarded with a large amount of cigarettes. Heiden never quite manage to break into the absolute top of his sport, although he achieved a 5th position in the 1930 World Championships. His other major feat was when he broke the world record on the 5000 m in 1933. Seven years later, Heiden was defending the city of Dordrecht against the German invasion.

He was considered in his competitive days as the best Central European cross-country skier. Grimmer participated in three consecutive Winter Olympics from 1968-76, with limited success due to injuries and illness. In 1976, the GDR relay had to give up because their leading second runner Axel Lesser had collided with an unknown person and was injured. The crew refused to protest because they did not know who to protest against, nor did anybody witness the incident. Grimmer successfully participated in the World Championships, winning two silver medals (relay and 30 km) and one bronze (50 km) in 1970. He also won two gold medals with the relay and over 50 km in 1974, as well as a silver over 15 km. Nationally, Grimmer won 20 East German national titles between 1965 and 1976. He trained as a machine fitter, and later studied machine construction. He then went to the Nationale Volksarmee (National People’s Army) in former GDR. From 1981-90 he was president of his home club, ASK Vorwärts Oberhof. Grimmer also became a Technical Delegate within the International Skiing Association (FIS) from 1985. In 1990, Grimmer co-founded the Thuringian Ski Association, but had to resign in 1995 because of its proximity to the former GDR state apparatus. In 1981, the life of Grimmer in biographical form was described by Harry Gerlach in the book The White Track. After re-unification Grimmer was employed by the Bundeswehr. Following rumors in 1990 that Grimmer had actively sanctioned doping practices in East Germany, he was dismissed from the Bundeswehr. He always denied any involvement with doping practices.","Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the Winter Universiade (0–1–0 1970 Rovaniemi CCS silver: 4×10 km relay) Listed in Olympians Who Were Awarded the Holmenkollmedaljen (1975) Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the World Nordic Ski Championships (2–3–1 1970 Vysoké Tatry CCS silver: 30 km and 4×10 km relay, bronze: 50 km; 1974 Falun CCS gold: 50 km and 4×10 km relay, silver: 15 km)"

83601,Reidar Andersen,Male,20 April 1911,,, Norway,NOR,"Reidar Andersen was only surpassed by Birger Ruud as Norway’s leading ski jumper in the 1930s. He would never win an international title as Ruud did on several occations, but Andersen is still the only ski jumper to win Holmenkollen three years in a row (1936-38), the same years he was also Norwegian Champion. His breakthrough came in 1930 when at age 18 he won a silver medal at the World Championships on home ground in Holmenkollen. Five years later he was second again, narrowly beaten by Birger Ruud. After his bronze medal in the 1936 Winter Olympics (won by Ruud), he won another silver at the 1937 World Championships, this time also with Ruud at the top of the rostrum. Andersen was the favorite for the gold in the same championships in 1938 in Lahti, Finland after impressive training jumps. However, the day before the competition he strained an ankle during a cross-country skiing trip, and was only able to place fifth in the competition, while the youngest of the Ruud brothers, Asbjørn, became world champion. Reidar Andersen was known for his stylish jumps, and was the first ever jumper to be awarded maximum style points of 20 when winning at Holmenkollen in 1938. He was elegant in all ways, always using white gloves in competitions. But he was also able to make long jumps, holding the hill record at Holmenkollen for several years. In 1934 the world’s largest ski jumping hill was opened in Planica, Yugoslavia, and Birger Ruud jumped a new world record of 92.5 m. The year after four Norwegian ski jumpers, among them Reidar Andersen, were invited to participate. The day before the competition Andersen jumped a new world record of 99.5 m, and was confident that he would be the first man to pass 100 m in the competition next day. The Norwegian Ski Association was however afraid of the new big hills and feared for the jumpers’ safety, so the Norwegian jumpers were denied the chance to start, and had to watch the competition from the stands. The next winter, with no Norwegians present, the Austrian Sepp Bradl became the first man to surpass the 100 m mark, improving the world record to 101.5 m. In 1939 Andersen went to the United States to promote skiing, and made several jumping exhibitions in cities like San Francisco and Los Angeles. After the war he placed third in the 1946 Norwegian Championships. At the 1948 Olympics he was coach for the Norwegian ski jumping team. He was also a successful businessman, establishing a firm producing sports articles. Andersen was famous for designing the first mountain anorak, especially known for its practical chest pocket. His great grandson Simen Spieler Nilsen was one of Norway’s most promising junior speed skaters, as a member of the Norwegian team in Team Pursuit he was Junior World Champion in Moscow 2010 and Obihiro 2012.

84401,John Brown,Male,21 April 1935,175.0,85, Great Britain,GBR,"John Brown had a very eventful and varied life. He was a parachute instructor, school teacher, RAF officer, rugby international, Olympic bobsledder and property developer. Born in London just before World War II, Brown was born within the sounds of “bow bells” thus making him a true Cockney. When enemy bombs destroyed his father’s business, the family moved to Somerset where Brown grew up. At school he played rugby, hockey and cricket, but excelled in the former, and soon captained the school first XV and represented Somerset schools. At the age of 17 he played senior rugby for Yeovil before a move to Northampton. Brown did his two years National Service with the Royal Signals Regiment from 1954, and when he returned to Northampton in 1956 he decided he wanted a change of career and moved to St. Luke’s College, Exeter, to train as a teacher. After two years, he took up his first teaching post in London and joined the famous Blackheath rugby club. He was a Somerset county player at the time but, upon moving to London, switched his allegiance to his county of birth, Middlesex, much to the annoyance of Somerset. A former England schoolboy, he played in a senior England trial in 1960 but broke his ankle four days later and he was out of action for the rest of the season. It also cost him his chance to play for England, which never came along again. Later that year Brown left teaching and joined the RAF and became a parachute instructor. He played rugby for the RAF and the Combined Services, and in 1962, toured South Wales with the Barbarians and then South Africa with the British Lions. The following year he switched clubs again and joined Harlequins. A fellow officer in the RAF was Mike Freeman, a member of the British Olympic bobsleigh squad and he talked John into joining the team, and at St. Moritz in 1968, Brown was a member of the British team that won a bronze medal at the European Championships. It was the first time a British team had won a 4-man medal. Later that year he was in the GBR 2 team that finished 14th at the Grenoble Olympics. Although he was widely known as John Brown, in the rugby world he was known simply by his initials HJC. He retired from rugby in 1970, and from the RAF in 1976, having survived an IRA bomb attack four years earlier. Brown then acted as a selector for the RAF and Middlesex rugby teams, and went into business as a property builder and developer in an affluent part of Surrey.",Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the European Bob & Skeleton Championships (0–0–1 1968 St. Moritz bronze: Four-man)

His parents got him work as a ship’s boy sailing between Italy and South America, and when he got to Buenos Aires he met up with a cousin who was a printer and Porro worked with him. However, it did not last long and he returned to Italy where he worked as a mechanic. He also started working out at his first gymnasium in the Porta Ticinese district, before joining the better known Pro Italia Gymnastics in La Spezia. Military service ruled out any chance of Porro going to the 1904 Olympics but, in 1905, he was the minimum weight (<70 kg) Italian Greco-Roman champion for the first time. He retained the title in 1906 and won it again in 1908 and 1909. He also won the 70 kg title at the 1906 European Championships in Milano. At the time of the 1908 London Olympic Games, Porro was serving in the Italian Navy, and returned from the Games with the lightweight Greco-Roman gold medal. On his way back to his home in Italy, the train on which Porro was travelling passed through Spezia, and he was surprised to see the Navy band playing in the town square. He thought it was for a member of Royalty or some other notable person, but it was actually in Porro’s honour. When he returned to his destroyer Castelfidardo, he was greeted on board by the King of Italy, Vittorio Emanuele III, who presented a special gold medal to the Olympian. An injured hand forced Porro to miss the 1912 Olympics. After World War I he finished second in the Inter-Allied Games at Joinville-le-Pont and was optimistic of success at the 1920 Antwerpen Olympics, but he failed to medal, as was also the case in Paris four years later.",Listed in Olympians Who Received the Italian Olympic Association (CONI) Gold Medal ()

After winning a silver medal in the 1996 Laser class, Ainslie won three consecutive titles in one-person dinghy, from 2000 to 2008, and in the one-person heavyweight dinghy in 2012.

This led to his being on the conservative side of the debate between classicists and modernists that eventually broke out in Woodstock and New York City. Speicher painted many landscapes, harbors, farms, and flowers. His work is built solidly on the past, in which he took methods from, and added his own flavor and personality. Speicher studied in Buffalo and at the Art Students League in New York City where he soon gained a reputation for portraiture. He shared a teacher and mentor in Robert Henri with Edward Hopper, and both artists revered Henri and cited him as a major influence on their approach to subject matter. The Hunter, painted by Speicher in oil on canvas sized 56.5 x 45.7 cm, was on loan from the Pittsburgh Athletic Association in 1932.

His best performance on the ice was an eighth position in the 1963 Dutch Allround Championships. In cycling, he had several national wins, before racing to gold in the 100 km team time trial at the 1964 Tokyo Games. This performance helped secure Karstens a spot in the pro circuit the following year. As a sprinter, he immediately proved his capabilities, winning the “Sprinters’ Classic” Paris-Tours, placing second in the Giro di Lombardia and winning the 21st stage of the Tour de France. He went on to win stages in all Grand Tours, 1 in the Giro d’Italia, 6 more in the Tour and no less than 14 in the Vuelta a España. In both 1967 and 1973, Karstens won four stages in the Vuelta. In two more classics, he crossed the line first: the 1969 Giro di Lombardia and 1974 Paris-Tours, but Karstens lost both wins. He failed a doping test in Lombardia, and supposedly “missed” the doping test in Tours. He also missed doping control after his stage win in the 1974 Tour, but was then reinstated, earning him the first of two days in the Yellow Jersey. In the peloton, where he raced until 1980, Karstens was known for his humor. On one occasion, he escaped from the pack, only to hide in the bushes and rejoin the pack from the back. He then enjoyed the peloton “chasing” him. Other such performances included grabbing a spectator’s bikini top and “blocking” the road with his bike.",

An extraordinary leader on the American three-time Olympic gold medal (2004, 2008, 2012) and multiple World championship gold medal 4x400m winning team, Richards-Ross finally won the one Olympic medal that had been eluding her – the individual 400m – at the 2012 Olympic Games in London. She was the best 400m runner in the world for a decade, world-ranked number one from 2005-2009 and again in 2012. Dominating the event for years, Richards-Ross did not lose a race over 400m between the 2005 World Championships in Helsinki and the 2007 USA Outdoor Championships. Considered one of the world’s fastest women, Richards-Ross has the most sub-50 second 400m races in the history of the event, and that stretch of wins included going under 50 seconds nine different times, and setting an American record of 48.70, ranking her number seven on the all-time world list. A seven-time medalist at the World Championships (five of which are gold), Richards-Ross finally won the 400m World title she had been chasing her entire career, at the 2009 World Championships in Berlin. She also has three relay gold medals from the newly created 2014 and 2015 World Relay Championships in the Bahamas (4x400m, distance medley relay). Richards-Ross underwent foot surgery for hallux rigidus right after the 2012 Olympic Games, which hindered her 2013 and 2014 season. She failed to make the World Championship team in 2013 due to the toe injury and had another surgery in 2015. She competed at the 2015 World Championships in Beijing, winning a silver medal as a member of the 4x400m relay team. Jamaican-born Richards-Ross started running at age seven and by the end of her high school years, where she had an outstanding academic record, she was also named the 2002 National High School Female Athlete of the Year. In 2002 she became an American citizen and won two medals at the World Junior Championships in her native land, Kingston, Jamaica – silver in the 400m, and bronze in the 200m. In 2010, Richards-Ross married her college sweetheart, professional football player Aaron Ross (two-time Superbowl champion with the New York Giants), whom she met while they were both student-athletes at the University of Texas. Off the track, Richards-Ross has many interests including businesses in the hair fashion industry, and even her own reality TV show called “Glam and Gold”.

2738,Monica Seles,Female,2 December 1973,179.0,70, United States,USA,"Seles was born in Novi Sad, in what was then Yugoslavia. She came to prominence as a teenager, winning the 1990 French Open when she was only 16-years-old. In the next three years Seles won the French Open three times (1990-92), the Australian Open three times (1991-93), and the US Open twice (1991-92). She also lost in the Wimbledon final, to Graf, in 1992. Seles took over the #1 world ranking from Graf in March 1991, and with her youth and her power, especially on the forehand side, she appeared set to win multiple Grand Slam events in the coming decade. But for a crazed German fan of Steffi Graf, a nine-inch knife, and lax tournament security, many tennis experts feel Monica Seles might have become the greatest female tennis player of all-time. On 30 April 1993, Seles was playing Magdalena Maleeva in a match in Hamburg, Germany. On one of the breaks, Günter Parche, a crazed fan of Graf’s, ran from the crowd and stabbed Seles in the back, near a shoulder blade. Physically, the wounds were somewhat superficial, but the emotional trauma of the attack never left her. Parche was charged with the assault and battery, but was ruled psychologically unstable and never served time. Seles was outraged over the final ruling and vowed to never compete in Germany again. Seles was eventually treated at the Steadman-Hawkins Clinic in Vail, Colorado, and later settled permanently in the United States, becoming a US citizen in March 1994. She had first come to the US to train in 1986 at the Bollettieri Tennis Academy in Florida. Seles eventually represented the US at the 1996 and 2000 Olympic Games, and competed from 1994 onward under the US flag. She helped the US win the Fed Cup in 1996, 1999, and 2000. Seles returned to the WTA Tour in August 1995. There was some discussion of returning her to the #1 ranking, alongside then #1 Steffi Graf, and this occurred despite some criticism. She made it to the final of the 1995 and 1996 US Open, losing both to Graf, and Seles won the 1996 Australian Open, but she was never again the dominant player she had been before the attack. Seles also lost in the final of the 1998 French Open. After the attack Seles won six WTA titles, including the 2000 Italian Open. Seles effectively retired during the 2003 season, hobbled by a foot injury, although her formal retirement announcement came only in November 2008. Considered one of the greatest women players ever, despite her shortened career, Martina Navratilova, in a 2013 interview noted that if Seles had not been stabbed, “We’d be talking about Monica with the most Grand Slam titles [ahead of] Margaret Court or Steffi Graf.”",

37205,Harold Barker,Male,12 April 1886,,, Great Britain,GBR,"The son of the Dean of Carlisle, Harold Baker attended Eton College before going to Oxford University. He rowed with the Christ Church College eights and in 1908 they won the Grand Challenge Cup at Henley. Barker also won that year’s Silver Goblets with Albert Gladstone, and he also won his rowing Blue in 1908. At the Olympics later in the year, Berker was a silver medallist with the Leander coxless fours. Victory in the 1909 Boat Race followed for Barker as the Oxford eight won by three and a half lengths with what many regarded was the finest Oxford crew ever seen. Barker and Gladstone followed that with victory in the University Pairs that year. Barker coached the winning Oxford crew in the 1913 Boat Race and then served as a captain with the 5th Royal Yorkshire Battalion (The Green Howards) in World War I. After the War he coached the Oxford crew in the 1921 and 1926 Boat Races but without success. Barker worked for the Board of Education and later practiced as a barrister, but in his spare time he enjoyed nothing more than coaching young rowers who were members of house crews at Oxford.

47200,Jack Besford,Male,30 January 1911,,, Great Britain,GBR,"In 1927, at the age of 16, Jack Besford was the number one backstroke swimmer in Britain. That year, he won the first of seven national 150-yard backstroke titles between then and 1936. The next man to win seven such titles was John Brockway in 1955. In addition to winning the title seven times, Besford was also runner-up four times, in 1926, 1929 and 1933-34. Besford, who studied to be a dentist at Manchester University, appeared at two Olympics, 1928 and 1936. In between he finished third in the British Empire Games 100 yards backstroke in 1930. Four years later he won the silver medal and added another bronze in the 3x110 yards medley relay with Mickey Ffrench-Williams and Alan Summers. Also in 1934, Besford won the 100 metres backstroke gold medal at the European Championships in Magdeburg, and he brought home with him the extremely large Hitler Trophy. The unique trophy was commissioned by the German Chancellor Adolf Hitler, who was so confident that the German Ernst Küppers would win the gold medal. The trophy, a model of a bronze eagle standing over 2-feet tall (61cm) and weighing around one hundredweight (51kg), was to be presented to Küppers by the Führer, but his propaganda machine let him down and Besford was champion. It is reported that Hitler stormed out of the arena, leaving the president of the German Swimming Association to present the trophy to the Briton. The trophy ended up in Besford’s dental practice in Brighton. He would dearly have loved to repeat his success at the Berlin Olympics two years later, but unfortunately he did not. Besford quit serious swimming in 1936 but made a comeback, and attempted to win his eighth national title in 1939, but without success. He served with the Royal Navy in World War II. He later taught dentistry at the University of Beijing and also spent a while living in Japan before returning to Brighton. Besford was honoured with the OBE in 1974 for services to the British community in Tokyo. He retired to live in Jávea, Spain, where he died in 1993. He married Pat Leveaux in 1940, and as Pat Besford, she became one of the most respected female sports journalists of the post-war era and was author of several swimming books, including Encyclopaedia of Swimming (1971). Their son, also a dentist, looked after the Hitler Trophy and put it on display in his Harley Street surgery before giving it to the Victoria Baths in Manchester, where his father did his swimming training as a youngster.","Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the European Aquatics Championships (1–0–0 1934 Magdeburg SWM gold: 100 m backstroke) Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the British Empire/Commonwealth Games (0–1–2 1930 Hamilton SWI bronze: 100 yards backstroke (competed for England); 1934 London SWI silver: 100 yards backstroke, bronze: 3×110 yards medley (competed for England))"

He and his second wife, Mardy Allen, researched Renaissance frescoes in Italy. He then painted mainly murals depicting the social scenes of his country in lobbies in Washington, DC. During the Great Depression following the stock market crash of 1929, Newell was supported by the U.S. government, receiving numerous commissions for murals in government buildings. One of Newell’s best-known works was eight murals titled The History of Western Civilization, at Evander Childs High School in 1938, showing people’s life in the Bronx. The murals show primitive man building his society, youth migrating from it to new lands, the meeting and mingling of tribes, the clashing of eastern culture and scientific knowledge with western force, building knowledge and ideas of law and democracy. His submitted work Archers was a fresco. It is possible that it was not classified as a painting, but rather in the category of “drawings and watercolors”. A fresco in the Grand Salon of the American Foundation of the Cité Internationale Universitaire de Paris is titled Sport. It shows dancers, horsemen and archers in front of the Parthenon. It was created in 1929 - 1930 in the Art Deco style as one of a total of 6 frescoes. The Sports fresco praises the athletic culture of American universities and the ideal of an ancient Greek city. The overall design was by French painter Robert La Montagne Saint-Hubert (1887-1950), who was assisted by Ethel Wallace (1885-1968) and James Newell.

He is regarded by many as the greatest American painter of the 19th century. He served an apprenticeship in his hometown of Boston under John Henry Bufford (1810-70), a lithographer. During the Civil War, Homer worked as a correspondent for “Harper’s Weekly”, illustrating battle scenes and everyday life in Union Army camps. After the war he painted many scenes of women and young children. After exhibiting his works at the National Academy of Design, he traveled to Paris in 1867, studying for one year, where he observed the painting techniques of his peers. While there he did landscape painting and continued to work for “Harper’s Weekly”. On his return Homer painted mostly scenes of rural and family life. He began working in watercolors in 1873, settling in Gloucester, Massachusetts in 1873 where he revived his love of the sea. In 1881-82 Homer spent two years painting in Cullercoats, Tyne and Wear, England before returning to the United States and living on an island off the coast of Maine. There he emphasized sea scenes in watercolors. Homer is considered the premier American watercolorist, of whom it was said, “Homer used his singular vision and manner of painting to create a body of work that has not been matched.” Later he focused on oil paintings depicting the struggle of man with the violence of the sea. His painting Casting was exhibited hors concours 22 years after his death at the 1932 Art Competition in Los Angeles. Homer painted several watercolors with similar motifs. Casting, created in 1897, was on loan to the Addison Gallery in Andover, Massachusetts in 1932, where it remains today.

Prinstein’s duels with Alvin Kraenzlein were the highlight of many track meets at the turn of the century and they met three times in major meets in 1900. Prinstein opened with a new world record of 24-7¼ (7.50) at the Penn Relays, then Kraenzlein took the IC4A title and the Olympic gold medal, although that victory engendered considerable ill feeling between the two athletes. At the end of the qualifying round Prinstein held a narrow lead and he then declined to compete in the final because it was held on a Sunday. Prinstein claimed that he had an agreement with Kraenzlein that neither would compete in the final, but either Kraenzlein did not know this, or he reneged on the promise, because he returned to the Racing Club de Paris on that Sunday and beat Prinstein’s mark by a mere quarter of an inch. It seems likely that Kraenzlein did, in fact, renege on an agreement – it is unlikely that Prinstein, a Jew, would refuse to compete on Sunday unless in support of his teammates’ stand. Prinstein’s response to Kraenzlein’s actions was to take action of his own. He punched Kraenzlein, but they were quickly pulled apart before a fight ensued. After graduating from Syracuse in 1901, Prinstein joined the Irish-American AC and at the 1904 Olympics became the only man to ever win the long jump and triple jump at the same Olympics. Besides his Olympic successes, Prinstein won the AAU long jump title four times between 1898 and 1906. Prinstein later practiced as a lawyer, but died rather young.

Before his 20th birthday he had won the DSO and French Croix de Guerre. He started his military career in World War I, when Winston Churchill entrusted him with the command of the 1st Airborne division. Browning was chosen for the inaugural Winter Games in 1924 but broke both his legs in a training accident the day before the event was due to be run. In 1935 Browning became commander of the 2nd Bataillon of the Grenadier Guards. After a short period as commanding officer of the Small Arms School, he was given command of the 24th Guards Brigade in 1940. The following year, he was promoted to major-general commander of the 1st Airborne Division. In 1944, Browning was appointed commander of the 1st Airborne Corps and deputy to American Lieutenant-General Lewis H. Brereton as commanding general of the allied 1st Airborne Army during Operation Market Garden (Netherlands, 1944). When the operation was not successful, Browning was transferred to Southeast Asia as General-Secretary of the War Ministry. In 1932 Browning married the well-known novelist Daphne Du Maurier. After World War II, Browning became head of Princess Elizabeth’s personal staff. After her coronation as Queen Elizabeth II he took over as head of the Office of the Duke of Edinburgh. He was Deputy Chairman of the British Olympic Association, and commandant of the British team at the 1948 Summer Olympics. For almost 20 years Browning was Commodore of the Royal Fowey Yacht Club and after his retirement its first Admiral. When his health deteriorated because of his drinking, Browning resigned from his post in the Royal Household in 1959, but was awarded the Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order. During his last years, he lived in Menabilly Mansion, which had inspired Du Maurier’s novel Rebecca, made into a movie by Alfred Hitchcock. In 1963, two people were hurt in a car accident, which he had caused while under the influence of prescription drugs and alcohol. In 1965, Browning died from a heart attack.",Listed in Olympian Members of the Nobility (Sir)

He studied painting in Turku, while he was largely self-taught as a sculptor. He became deaf at the age of four and lived in Helsinki from 1917. He is mostly known for his monuments and portrait busts, but continued to produce oil paintings. Aaltonen became well-known for his sculpture of long-distance runner Paavo Nurmi, placed outside of the Olympic Stadium in Helsinki, which he created in 1924, and also for the portrait of the composer Jean Sibelius. Among his other well-known monuments are the sculptures of Field Marshal and later President Gustaf Mannerheim from 1953, composer and maestro Toivo Kuula, and the famous writer Aleksis Kivi. In 1964, the City Council of Turku planned to establish a museum dedicated to Wäinö Aaltonen, and Aaltonen himself played an active part in the planning. He also released his basic collection to the museum, which was officially opened in 1967, the year after his death. Aaltonen was awarded numerous prizes and was a member of many associations and academies at home and abroad. In France he was made a Knight of the Legion of Honor. The Javelin Thrower (Keihäänheittäjä) is said to have been a stopgap in 1948, as Finland, as host of the 1952 Games, wanted to submit at least one work in the sculpturing section. It was a bronze statue measuring 95 x 135 cm. In 1952, Aaltonen was then represented in the art exhibition with the group Tying of Friendship (Ystävyys solmitaan) made of plaster. This was commissioned by the city of Turku as a symbol and gratitude for the support provided by the city of Göteburg during World War II. The bronze statues were made in 1948 and unveiled in 1955. Today, the original stands on the edge of Renströmspark in Göteburg’s university district and a duplicate in front of the Concert Hall in Turku symbolizing the city partnership with Göteburg.

Émile Moussat was a school teacher before serving during World War I. He was captured early in 1914 and held as a prisoner-of-war (POW) in Germany until the end of the war. One of his best-known works Sous le Ciel d’Allemagne (Under the Heaven of Germany) tells about his experiences as a POW in these times. His memories are now a valuable source for historians and provide insights into the everyday’s life of a prisoner-of-war camp during World War I. After his release he taught further in Metz and Paris and joined the Résistance during World War II. At the end of 1940, the Gestapo arrested him in front of his students. He was reportedly released to his family, with the help of a World War I veteran within the Nazi intelligence service.

Babashoff set six world records in individual events and shared in a further five in relays. She also set 37 U.S. records (17 individual and 20 relay) and at one time held the U.S. freestyle record at every distance from 100m to 800m. Apart from her record-breaking ability, Shirley Babashoff had a fine competitive record in major championships, winning – including relays – 27 AAU titles in addition to taking the 200m and 400m individual gold medals at the 1975 World Championships. Her greatest performance ever came at the 1976 Olympic Trials when she won every freestyle event and the 400m individual medley. She set three U.S. records in the heats, three more in the finals, and broke the world record in the 800m freestyle. Not only was this her greatest performance ever, but it ranks among the great swimming feats of all time. Babashoff received some bad press in 1976 because she complained that the East German swimmers who defeated her, notably Kornelia Ender, were obviously using performance enhancing drugs (PEDs). After the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1990, documents from the East German secret police, the Stasi, were found and confirmed Babashoff’s suspicions.","Sister of Jack Babashoff Listed in Olympians Who Set a World Record in Long Course Swimming (200 m freestyle – 4 August 1972 - 1 September 1972 and 23 August 1974 - 15 March 1975: 2:05.21 (4 August 1972; Chicago, USA), 2:02.94 (23 August 1974; Concord, USA), 2:02.94 tied (31 August 1974; Concord, USA); 400 m freestyle – 22 August 1974 - 3 June 1976: 4:15.77 (22 August 1974; Concord, USA), 4:14.76 (20 June 1975; Long Beach, USA); 800 m freestyle – 21 June 1976 - 25 July 1976: 8:39.63 (21 June 1976; Long Beach, USA); 4×100 m freestyle relay – 9 September 1971 - 8 September 1973 and 31 August 1974 - 26 August 1978: 4:00.7 (9 September 1971; Minsk, URS), 3:58.11 (18 August 1972; Knoxville, USA), 3:55.19 (30 August 1972; München, FRG), 3:51.99 (31 August 1974; Concord, USA), 3:44.82 (25 July 1976; Montréal, CAN)) Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the World Aquatics Championships (2–7–1 1973 Belgrade SWI silver: 100 m freestyle, 200 m freestyle, 4×100 m freestyle relay, and 4×100 m medley relay; 1975 Cali SWI gold: 200 m freestyle and 400 m freestyle, silver: 100 m freestyle, 4×100 m freestyle relay, and 4×100 m medley relay, bronze: 800 m freestyle) Listed in Olympic Order Recipients (2000 (Silver))"

921422,Josef Suk,Male,4 January 1874,,, Czechoslovakia,TCH,"Josef Suk was a Czech composer and well-known violinist. He was the son-in-law of the famous composer Antonín Dvořák and grandfather of the violinist Josef Suk (1929-2011). From 1885-92 Suk studied at the Praha Conservatory, where he was also a professor and later was rector starting in 1922. He was initially influenced by Dvořák’s music and national romanticism until Suk lost his wife and father-in-law in the same year. His later works displayed a high degree of complexity achieving harmonious modernity. Suk composed mainly chamber and orchestral music as one of the representatives of Czech modernism. In addition, he was an excellent violinist and a member of the famous Czech string quartet. At times he also used the name Jaroslav. He never received his well-deserved approval outside the Czechoslovakia. The approximately 6-minute long composition march V nový život (_Into a New Life, op. 35) was written in 1920 as a symphonic march for the Sokol sports movement. In this year, it won a respected competition in Czechoslovakia. Suk, however, complained about the reluctant reaction of Sokol officials, probably because it was musically more complex than the typical sporting march. It was not before 1930 that the text was written by Petr Křička (1884-1949), who was a scholar, librarian, poet, and translator, and was the brother of composer Jaroslav Křička, who added the choral texture. The first complete performance (music and text) took place in 1931. This allowed Suk the Czechoslovakian Olympic Committee to enter Suk’s march, as the rules required that the work was completed within the last four years. Finally, in 1934, the Czechoslovakian Sokol accepted it as his official festive march. It has since been included as the third part of a so-called War Triptych, but it is unlikely that Suk had already intended this compilation. Into a new life is one of the very few compositions available on CD as a 1938 historical recording. It was recently played at the 2012 Night of the Proms in London.",

He later became a sports journalist. Meissl played in goal after World War I with the Vienna Amateurs football team. His brother Hugo, manager of the Austrian national team, appointed him to the team in 1920 for the match against Hungary, his only international. Willy Meisl also worked as a football coach for the Swedish club Hammarby IF from 1923-25. After completing his law studies Meisl started a career in sports journalism. From 1924-33 he was employed by the Berlin Vossische Newspaper and wrote numerous sports books. When he reported from the 1924 Paris Olympics, he coined the term “Heat Battle of Colombes” to describe the cross-country race, where temperatures reached over 40° C. (104° F.), turning the event into a survival test. He soon became known as “king of sports journalists” and “father of modern sports journalism” in Germany. After Fascism rose in Germany, Meisl, as a Jew, was forced to immigrate to England in January 1934, where he continued to work as a sports journalist. During World War II he served in the British Army, and after the war worked again as a journalist in England, Switzerland and Germany. Meisl was editor of the book Der Sport am Scheidewege (Sports at the crossroads), which was published in 1928. Above all, it contains his collected essays as well as contributions, amongst others, by Egon Erwin Kisch, Bert Brecht and Carl Diem.

He quickly developed into an outstanding cross-country runner, representing England in the International Cross-Country Championship in 1922 (12th), 1928 (5th) and 1929 (19th), and finishing second in the National in 1928. At the age of 35 he tried the marathon and on his début finished fourth in the 1928 Poly race. In his second marathon he won the 1928 AAA title with a new British record of 2-34:34 but injury spoiled his Olympic chances and he could only finish 13th in Amsterdam. Later in 1928 Sam Ferris took over as British record holder, but in the 1929 AAA race Payne recaptured the record with a new British best that remained unbeaten for almost 22 years. His time of 2-30:57.6 came within one minute of the world record. In 1930 Payne finished third in the Poly race and went to Canada for the British Empire Games, but while training on the Niagara Highway he was knocked over by a car and, although he started the race, he did not complete the course. His last major marathon was at the 1932 AAA Championships when he finished well behind the winner in third place and he was not selected for the Los Angeles Olympics. He was the first international from Woodford Green AC and was club President in 1956-57. Personal Bests: Mar – 2-30:57.6 (1929).",

He split the following year between the Rochester Americans of the American Hockey League and the Tulsa Oilers of the Central Professional Hockey League and was recruited by the Toronto Maple Leafs of the National Hockey League in 1969. He had a long run with the team, which lasted until 1978, but he is probably remembered for his appearance at the 1972 Summit Series, where the NHL faced off against the Soviet Union, even though he only skated in two exhibition games. His other newsworthy moment came in 1975 when he was attacked on-ice by Detroit Red Wings player Dan Maloney. Maloney was originally charged with assault for attacking Glennie with his stick during the match, but Maloney ended up doing community service to have the charge dropped, in addition to being banned from playing in Toronto for two seasons. Glennie played a final eighteen games with the NHL’s Los Angeles Kings the following year, and retired from active play in 1979. The recreation center at Cranberry Cove Marsh Resort near Lake Muskoka, where Glennie later worked, was named in his honor.

921783,Thomas Eakins,Male,25 July 1844,,, United States,USA,"Thomas Eakins was a photographer and sculptor, but was best known for his paintings. His best known works were sports images from rowing and swimming. However, he became successful and famous only after his death. Descended from an Irish family, he was an avid and versatile sportsman. His childhood friend Max Schmitt (1842-1900) taught him the German language. Eakins caused several scandals by his penchant for nudes, in a time of very prudish America. Today he is considered one of the most important and most expensive painters of the United States before World War II. The art historian Henry Adams (born 1949) described Thomas Eakins in 2005 as the “Michael Jackson” of his time, because he also was guilty of serious misconducts such as anti-Semitism, bestiality, exhibitionism, incest, lies, sadism, poor writing style, sexism, unattractiveness and voyeurism. Although Eakins was married three times, it is still unclear whether he was heterosexual or homosexual. What is known about some of his friends and students is that they were gay, but it was never confirmed that he himself was gay. In some of his works homosexual motives can be identified. In 1932 three of his works were posthumously exhibited hors concours because he died 16 years earlier. Several versions of The Oarsmen were painted between 1872 and 1874. The entered painting, which is in the Pennsylvania Museum, dates from 1872 and was initially titled The Pair-Oared Shell (oil on canvas, 61 x 91.4 cm). The portrayed rowers were Eakins’ friends Henry and Billy Schreiber. The painting showed them on the Schuylkill River next to a pier of the Columbia Railroad Bridge in Philadelphia. The second painting with a rowing motif, is fully titled The Biglin Brothers Turning the Stake. It showed the brothers’ two-oared shell making a turn around a pole. Eakins painted it in 1874 in oil on canvas measuring 101.3 x 151.4 cm, now in the Cleveland Museum of Art. Unlike the Schreibers, the three Biglin brothers were professional rowers. The painting shows John (?-1886) and Barney (1840–1924) Biglin in a famous race on the Schuylkill River in 1872. Between Rounds was painted much later in 1898/99 in oil on canvas, measuring 127.3 x 101.3 cm. As early as 1929, this work was also donated to the Pennsylvania Museum. It did not show any specific boxing fight but the setting was carefully arranged by Eakins.",Listed in Olympians Who Competed Posthumously ()

However, he first graduated in law from the Stefan Batory University in Vilnius. From 1933-34 he was a member of the leftist literary avant-garde group Żaga-ry (Brushwood) with a first publication in 1933 in the Vilnius daily newspaper “Słowo” (“The Word”). His early work was dominated by visionary-fantastic and aesthetic motifs. Rymkiewicz endured World War II as a worker and member of the Home Army in Vilnius. After the war he settled in Warszawa and worked successively in the Ministry of Supply and Trade, on the main board of the Polish Writers’ Union, and as an editor of a weekly newspaper. From 1954 he was an advisor in the Ministry of Culture and Art, and in the 1970s editor of the magazine “Poezji”. In the post-war period he spent much time in Warmińsko-Mazurskie, where he eventually died. His later poetry covered social-patriotic themes, reflections on the relationship between man and nature, and the native landscape. Rymkiewicz also wrote numerous books for children, using various pseudonyms. He also translated Bulgarian, Czech, Slovak, Russian, and Hungarian literature and opera libretti into Polish. In 1952 Kierst won the national poetry competition with his collection of poems Unarmed Victors - Olympic Poems. The small volume of only 28 pages was published in the same year by the Czytelnik publishing house in Warsaw.

Born to a single mother he entered the Finnish Navy after elementary school. Transferred to the Army during World War II, he spent two years fighting on the front line. But in 1943 he was transferred to entertain the troops where his excellent singing voice first achieved notice. After the war, Rautavaara competed as a javelin thrower. He was bronze medalist at the 1946 European Championships, and 5th at that meet in 1950, and was Finnish javelin champion in 1944-45, and 1947-49, in addition to his Olympic gold medal. But he was also a top archer and competed on the Finnish team that won the World Team Championship in 1958, and he was Finnish champion in archery in 1955. But Rautavaara is best remembered in Finland for his singing and acting. He toured Finland performing in the 50s and early 60s, and eventually recorded over 300 songs. He began acting in films and television after World War II, and appeared in over 20 movies. At one time, he was considered for the role of Tarzan.

66279,Percy Williams,Male,19 May 1908,170.0,56, Canada,CAN,"Canadian Percy Williams was always an underdog to have any sort of athletic career, much less to win a gold medal at the Olympic Games. Already a slight boy, he was afflicted with rheumatic fever at the age of fifteen and instructed by his doctors to avoid demanding physical activities. Nevertheless, he took up running in 1924, as athletic competition was mandated by his high school, and, by 1927, he was becoming well-known in his native Vancouver for participating in – and winning – local running events. He worked as a waiter and dishwasher in a dining car to earn his passage to Hamilton, Ontario where the trials for the 1928 Summer Olympics were being held. Despite having never taken part in a competitive 100 metre race, he won it in a time of 10.6 seconds, equaling the Olympic record. With a subsequent victory in the 200 metre event he was guaranteed a spot on the Canadian delegation. Williams did not disappoint: he twice equaled the Olympic record during the 100 and easily captured the gold medal in the final. His victory came as such a surprise to the international community that the medal presentation was delayed while Olympic administrators scrambled to find a recording of the Canadian anthem to play. Offered the chance by Canadian officials to drop out of the 200 because of his success, he declined and went on to capture that title as well. He again had the opportunity to be replaced, this time in the 4×100 relay, but decided to press on. His luck did not hold out, however, and the Canadian team was disqualified after his teammate Buck Hester dropped the baton while attempting to pass it Williams. There was still more gold in his future, however, and he captured the 100 yard dash at the inaugural British Empire Games in 1930. Several days prior he had set a world in the 100 metres by becoming the first person to run the distance in 10.3 seconds, a feat that would not be equaled for nearly two years nor beaten for almost six. It was to be the end of his athletic career, however, as he pulled a muscle during the British Empire Games and was never able to regain his former glory. He competed in the 100 metre event and the sprint relay at the 1932 Summer Olympics, but he failed to medal in either category and retired soon thereafter. He then led a low-key life as an insurance salesman, never marrying, and committed suicide in 1982 after suffering from depression and chronic arthritic pain. In 1950 a Canadian Press poll named him the greatest national track and field performer of the last fifty years and upgraded him to “Canada’s All-Time Olympic athlete” in 1972. In 1978 he was bestowed the Vancouver Civic Recognition Award and in 1980 he was made a member of the Order of Canada. He is enshrined in both the British Columbia and Canadian Sports Halls of Fame.

He was defeated in the semifinals by another Canadian, Joe Wright, Jr., but decided to join with Wright to form a double sculls crew capable of contending at that year’s Summer Olympics. At the Games they survived to the finals, where they were defeated by the American duo of Charley McIlvaine and Paul Costello, and took home a silver medal. Guest was Canadian champion in the single sculls in 1929, but lost again to Wright at the Diamond Sculls, who was in turn defeated by Bert Gunther of the Netherlands in the final. Guest then embarked upon an intense, year-long training regimen and entered the Diamond Sculls again in 1930. This time he did not meet Wright, but instead faced Gerhard Boetzelen of Germany in the finals, who had earlier bested Wright. Guest triumphed easily and retired from active competition immediately after. Guest remained active on the rowing scene as an administrator, most notably as the president of the Don Rowing Club of Mississauga, where he had spent most of his non-Olympic competitive career, from 1938 through 1952. He also managed the Canadian rowing delegations to the 1956 Summer Olympics and the 1962 and 1966 British Empire and Commonwealth Games and was the first Canadian representative at the International Federation of Rowing Associations. Additionally, he was director of the Canadian Olympic Committee (then the Canadian Olympic Association) from 1960 through 1968. He was inducted into Canada’s Sports Hall of Fame in 1955. The Jack Guest award is given annually to the junior single sculler of the year by Rowing Canada. His son, Jack Guest, Jr., was also an elite rower who would have competed at the 1952 Summer Olympics if not for an injury that required surgery.",

Four of his records came after he went to study at California, when he took part in events alongside some of the great American throwers like Al Oerter, Fortune Gordien, Jay Silvester and Rink Babka, amongst others. Carr was educated at Wanstead Grammar School in Essex, a sports-orientated school that encouraged his discus throwing. He then did National Service in the RAF before going to Loughborough College, where he became friends again with hammer thrower Mike Ellis, who served with Carr in the RAF Fighter Command. After three years, Carr graduated from Loughborough and had to decide to either go into teaching, re-join the RAD, emigrate to Australia or try for a scholarship in the USA. He opted for the latter and was eventually accepted at UCLA, and it was here that he started meeting all the great American athletes of the day. He once beat Jay Silvester in a discus competition, only because his illustrious opponent fouled out on every throw! At UCLA, Carr took a degree in English and also taught basic courses in the physical education department before moving to the University of Victoria, Canada, in 1967. He taught the history of the Ancient and Modern Olympic Games, and one day was asked to teach biomechanics, which he did, and he went on to become a leading teacher of the subject. Although professor Carr retired in 2001, he continued teaching the subject occasionally, Although only 20 when competing at the 1956 Olympics, where he finished tenth, it was Carr’s only Olympics. He competed at the British Empire and Commonwealth Games in Cardiff in 1958 and won the bronze medal representing England. Carr had been the AAA junior shot champion in 1952 and discus champion in 1953-54. In the 1950s and 60, Britain had three world-class discus throwers, and because Mark Pharaoh and Mike Lindsay were around at the same time, Carr never won a senior AAA discus title, finishing second in 1955-57 and third in 1958. Carr wrote several books on a variety of topics, mostly relating to sport, including “The Fundamentals of Track and Field” and “Sport Mechanics for Coaches”. After his retirement, Carr lived on Vancouver Island off Canada’s west coast, where he took up painting and learned to speak Spanish.

Born in Yokohama, an enclave of foreigners, he got in touch with Western influences in art leading to a new type of woodcuts. Thus, he also became one of the few Japanese artists to experiment in the Western Style. During his youth, he met the painter and woodcutter Goda Kiyoshi, who was familiar with traditional Japanese as well as with Western style graphical art. In 1917 he traveled for two years to Canada and the United States to learn the local techniques. On his return, Kawakami became an English teacher in a public school in Tochigi Prefecture and started his own graphical activities, producing single sheets as well as self-printed books in limited numbers. Kawakami’s style was sometimes ironical and humorous, with many of his print subjects dealing with the impact of foreigners on the Japanese culture. During the last years of World War II, he and his family were evacuated to the northern island of Hokkaido, where they stayed until 1949. Kawakami achieved widespread recognition in the 1960s. The Kawakami Sumio Graphic Art Museum in Kanuma, Tochigi prefecture is entirely devoted to his work. Kawakami did not receive considerable recognition until the 1960s.

Vardanyan took up weightlifting in 1970 under his uncle Sergey Vardanyan. After winning middleweight gold at the 1975 and 1976 World and European Junior Championships, Vardanyan won his first senior World title in 1977 in thw middleweight class. Moving up to light-heavyweight, he won six more World titles in 1978-81, 1983 and 1985. Vardanyan won the light-heavyweight gold at the 1980 Olympics, with a total of 400.0 kg, which would have been sufficient to win gold at two higher classes and a bronze in heavyweight class at the same Olympics. Vardanyan would almost certainly have won another gold medal in 1984 were it not for the Soviet boycott. In 1982 he won silver in the middle-heavyweight class at the World Championships. Vardanyan also won one European middleweight title in 1977, four light-heavyweight titles in 1978, 1980-81 and 1983 and middle-heavyweight silver in 1982 and light-heavyweight silver in 1984. Domestically, Vardanyan won four Soviet titles: 1977 in middleweight, 1979 in light-heavyweight, and 1981 and 1982 in middle-heavyweight. He also won the Soviet middleweight cup in 1976. During his career Vardanyan set 42 world records, five as a middleweight (three in snatch, one in clean & jerk and one in total), 29 as a light-heavyweight (nine in snatch, 11 in clean & jerk and nine in total), and eight as a middle-heavyweight (three in snatch, three in clean & jerk and two in total). His final light-heavyweight total world record of 405.0 kg set in 1984 stayed unbeaten until the IWF reconstructed the weight classes in 1992. Even after the reconstruction, when 2½ kg heavier athletes were allowed to compete as light-heavys, his record has not been surpassed. In 1985 Vardanyan was elected to the Armenian SSR Supreme Soviet (parliament, and decided to retire from weightlifting to concentrate on politics. In 1991, after the fall of the Soviet Union, Vardanyan emigrated to the United States, settling in Los Angeles. In America Vardanyan has worked as a weightlifting coach, coaching his son Norik, who won the US title as a middle-heavyweight in 2008.

It has goals to teach young people good sportsmanship in addition to developing their critical thinking skills, strengthening their self-confidence, encouraging the maintenance of an active and healthy lifestyle and supporting academic achievement. The Peter Westbrook Foundation saw many of its goals reached at the 2000 Olympics when three graduates of the program competed in Sydney – Akhi Spencer-El, Keeth Smart, and his sister Erinn Smart. In 1997 Westbrook published his life’s story, Harnessing Anger: The Way of an American Fencer.","Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the Summer Pan American Games (3–7–1 1975 Ciudad de México FEN silver: sabre team, bronze: sabre; 1979 San Juan FEN silver: sabre and sabre team; 1983 Caracas FEN gold: sabre, silver: sabre team; 1987 Indianapolis FEN silver: sabre and sabre team; 1991 La Habana FEN silver: sabre team; 1995 Mar del Plata FEN gold: sabre and sabre team)"

He played 144 times in the Argentine first division, and scored five goals. Along with Rodolfo Vicente, Daniel Gil, and Giorgio Vallejos, Morales was one of four Atlanta players who moved to Greece in 1972. Moráles, Gill and Vallejos joined AE Larissa (AEL), while Vicete went to AEK Athens. After his playing career, Morales had a spell as coach to AEL in 1975/76 and as assistant coach to Jacek Gmoch in 1988, when the club won the Greek Championship for the first time in their history. As at 2021, it remained their only League title. After Gmoch left his post, Morales took charge of the club again, but for just two months. He remained in Larissa for the rest of his life, and died there in 2021. He didn’t know it at the time, but Morales played a significant role, through no fault of his own, in the worst football stadium disaster in history. On 24 May 1964, Argentina played Peru in a qualifying match for the Tokyo Olympics at the National Stadium, Lima. Argentina needed a win to qualify, while Peru needed a win to keep their hopes alive. The visitors opened the scoring after 18 minutes of the second half, and 10 minutes from time Moráles cleared out of defence, but his clearance hit the boot of Peru’s “Kiko” Lobatón and went into the goal. The Uruguayan referee called a foul against the Peruvian, however, and disallowed he goal. After protests on the pitch the referee cancelled the match and home fans ran onto the pitch and tried to attack the referee. This sparked rioting on the terraces and the police released their dogs, and fired tear gas into the crowd. This sparked panic, as fans tried to get out of the ground. Sadly, the gates many of them were heading towards were closed. As a result, at least 328 people would lose their life, and 500 more were injured trying to escape. Rioting and looting spilled onto the streets around the ground. The qualifying group was subsequently suspended, although Brazil and Peru played off two weeks later to see who would finish second. Brazil won 4-0.","Listed in Olympians Who Participated in the 1964 Olympic Football Qualification Campaign (5 App. - 0 goals - 360+ min. played: Qualification tournament in Peru: COL 2:0, ECU 1:0, CHI 4:0, URU 3:1, PER 1:0)"

Brumel took up athletics in 1954 and came to prominence in the 1960 Olympic year, when he won a silver medal behind his teammate, Robert’ Shavlaq’adze. The next year, Brumel set his first world record, clearing 2.23. He took the record from John Thomas, with whom Brumel would have numerous duels, Brumel usually winning.

His greatest event was the 1952 Helsinki Olympics where he won two golds on the track, in the sprint and the tandem sprint, alongside Lionel Cox. Earlier in 1952 Mockridge had won the Paris Grand Prix in the amateur division and then raced against the professionals in the open division, defeating the renowned Reg Harris. This led to amateurs being barred from competing in the open division for many years. At the 1950 British Empire Games Mockridge won gold medals in the kilometre time trial and the match sprint, adding a silver medal in the individual pursuit. Mockridge turned professional after the 1952 Olympics and competed for six years as a pro, primarily on the roads. In 1955 Mockridge won the Paris Six-Day, riding with Sid Patterson and Reginald Arnold. Later that year he rode and finished the Tour de France, placing 64th in general classification. He won the Australian road race title in 1956-58. His other palmarès included winning the 1955 Tour de Vaucluse in France, and the 1957 Tour of Tasmania, in which he won four stages. Sadly, Mockridge died young and in competition. While riding in the 1958 Tour of Gippsland, only two miles after the start, he was hit by a bus and succumbed to his injuries.","Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the British Empire/Commonwealth Games (2–1–0 1950 Auckland CYC gold: track time trail and Sprint 1000 m, silver: 4000 m individual pursuit) Listed in Olympians Who Died in Competition or Training (Died after being hit by a bus during the 1958 Tour of Gippsland.)

He moved to Australia and was soon called up to join the Royal Air Force as a cook. After his discharge, he held a variety of positions before travelling to the United States and being inspired to found a Hawaiian bar in Birmingham, called The Castaways, in 1966. When that business failed a few years later, he took up sailing and moved to Grenada, where he became involved in the tourism industry. Following the turmoil caused by Grenada’s independence struggle, Reeve moved to the United States Virgin Islands in 1976, which he made his permanent home, and restarted his life in the tourism industry. In the 1980s he was convinced by his friend, John Foster, Sr., an Olympic sailor, to take up bobsledding, and the duo made it to the Olympics in 1988, placing 38th in the two-man event. Reeve was also entered into the giant slalom competition in alpine skiing, but did not start the event. A documentary on his life, titled “Bet on Yourself”, was released in 2019.",

His involvement in the sport reached beyond participation, as he managed the Canadian canoe team at the 1967 Pan American Games and the canoe and whitewater team at the 1972 Summer Olympics, in addition to serving as an official at the 1976 edition. In-between he founded Canoe Ontario in 1974. He also worked as the treasurer of the Western Ontario Division of the Canadian Canoe Association from 1945 through 2000.

Edgar Gilbert Award, the highest honor of the Canadian Canoe Association, as a builder, as well as the Queen’s Jubilee Award for his volunteer efforts. Outside of canoeing he was also a skilled lawn tennis and squash player, having been introduced to the latter sport in the 1940s while attending the University of Toronto’s Victoria College. He served as president of the Toronto Lawn Tennis Club and won the Ontario singles squash championship in 1974, several Canadian masters championships, and medals at the World’s Masters Championships. He continued to play squash until the age of 85. Even after being diagnosed with cancer he continued to play bridge and golf. Career-wise, he worked with Sears Canada for 38 years until his 1984 retirement, although he continued to serve as part of the Sears Forum Group until a month before his death from leukemia in January 2010.

He made his international debut in the 1972 ISU Junior Championships, placing fourth. In his first championships as a senior, the European Championships 1974, he was the big surprise. After winning both the 500 and 1,500 metres, and placing third in the 5,000 m, he was in the lead before the finishing 10K, but Göran Claeson was too strong, and beat him by 0.023 points. In the World Championships in Inzell later that season Sjøbrend had problems with the moist mountain air, and collapsed during his 5,000, forcing him to withdraw from the competition. In 1975 he won the National Championships, but from 1976-80 he was more or less in the shadow of his famous teammates. He had no luck at the Olympic Games. In 1976 he was not qualified for his favorite distance, 1,500 m, and the changing ice conditions made it impossible for him to fight for medals in the 5,000 and 10,000. Before the Olympic season of 1980 he trained harder than ever before and ended up overtrained, not qualifying for the Games. In national races during the Games he proved to be in shape after all, and qualified for the Norwegian team for the World Championships, placing fourth. He had his best season in 1981, winning both the European and the World Title. The world title was not won his until the last lap of his 10,000 m.

The following tear, Tarrant created quite a stir by finishing both runner-up to William Cuthbertson in the flyweight division, and beating T. Herbison to capture the bantamweight crown. Tarrant’s reaching of two finals in the one year was to eventually see a change to the ABA rules, which said all bouts had to be held on the same day, thus eliminating the prospect of a boxer competing at two weights. Tarrant retained his flyweight title in 1922 by beating J. Duley of Gainsford. Tarrant lost to A W Smith of Limehouse in the 1923 bantamweight final before winning his last title (bantamweight) against Archie Rule in 1924.

69179,Martin Hyman,Male,3 July 1933,178.0,66, Great Britain,GBR,"Although born in Southampton, Martin Hyman lived in Jersey as a youngster, but just two weeks before the Germans invaded the island, he was sent to England as an evacuee. He had an unsettled childhood and attended many different schools. It was therefore quite remarkable that he should win a place at Southampton University when he was 18. He was in the university cross-country team and in his third year, had progressed from being an “also ran” into one of the best in the area. In his last year at university, Portsmouth AC secretary Andy Gibb invited Hyman to join the club, which he did, and remained a member for 65 years, despite never living in the city. Before he started his serious career with Portsmouth, Hyman had to serve two years National Service. Being a conscientious objector, he worked with the ambulance service at Linz in Austria, looking after Hungarian refugees who fled the country after the 1956 Soviet invasion. During his time in Austria, Hyman continued his athletics training with the Linz AC. Upon returning home in 1957, Hyman took a post-graduate course at Southampton University, and continued to compete in university athletics competitions, and was the 1958 National Universities cross-country champion. Hyman was third in the 1961 International Cross-country Championships at Nantes. He was by then also enjoying long-distance track and road racing, and he enjoyed one of the greatest moments of his career when he beat Ethiopian Olympic marathon champion Abebe Bikila to win the 1962 São Paulo “San Silvestre” New Year Race. Hyman never won a AAAs title, but was second to Gordon Pirie in the six miles in 1960, and third in both 1958 and 1962. Hyman was four times ranked in the world top 10 for the 10,000 metres, and reached number two in 1959. He competed at the 1960 Rome Olympics and represented England at the 1958 and 1962 British Empire and Commonwealth Games. One of his finest performances in an international competition was in finishing fourth in the 10,000 at the 1962 European Championships in a race won by the Olympic champion Pyotr Bolotnikov. When he was not away on international duty, Hyman raced most weekends for Portsmouth. He was club captain and, along with his friend Bruce Tulloh, who he met when a university post-graduate, helped elevate them to one of the best clubs in Europe. Hyman was the first Briton to break 28 minutes for the six miles, and his 10,000 record of 29:02.0 was still a club record at the time of his death, 60 years after he set it. Hyman moved to Scotland in 1979 to take up a teaching post at Livingston, and duly joined the Livingston AAC where he was involved with training, coaching, and the staging of events. He was course designer for the 1995 World Mountain Running Championships at Holyrood Park, Edinburgh.

Her best result was a second place in an individual 10 km race in 1988 and the bronze medal in the relay at the 1987 World Championship. She was a member of the 1992 Olympic cross-country team but with little success. In 1993, she decided to join the biathlon team, making the top ranks in the world in no time because she was not only a good skier but also a very precise shooter. In 1994, she had to undergo Achilles surgery but managed to win her first bronze medal at the 1996 World Championships. In 1997 Forsberg became double world champion, winning the individual event and the ever first pursuit title, also repeating as bronze medalist in the sprint. Through 2001 she won four more titles at the World Championships for a total of six. In the World Cup Forsberg was even more successful, ranking first in the overall World Cup, from 1997-2002. In total she succeeded in 42 World Cup races and, therefore, was voted female biathlete of the 20th century. Her best season was 2000-01, when she won eight straight races in the World Cup and 14 races in the whole season, both figures unmatched in biathlon. She made the top three in 19 and the top ten in 22 of 25 races that year. Until 2011-12 she held the record of overall World Cup points until she was passed by Magdalena Neuner. In addition to the overall World Cup in this season she won all World Cups in the various events in the 2000-01 season. She was similarly dominant in the following season repeating the clean sweep in all the World Cup disciplines. In one race she made a remarkable mistake shooting at the wrong target without noticing receiving 10 minutes penalty bringing her from second place to 95th place, the second last. Forsberg was less successful at the Winter Olympics. Only in the final stages of her career would she win two bronze medals at Salt Lake City in 2002, one individual and one in the relay. At these Olympics, she was the flagbearer of the Swedish team at the opening ceremony. During most of her career, Forsberg was coached by the German Wolfgang Pichler. She received the annual award of the sport section of Sveriges Radio in four of five consecutive years. After studying economics, she worked part time as a tax adviser because of a lack of funding for biathletes. After her active career, she acted as an expert for German TV until 2007 and until today for the Swedish broadcasting station SVT. In 2008 the Mid Sweden University awarded her an honorary doctorate, and in 2011 she acquired a Management Diploma for Athletes.

His mentor in swimming was his elder brother Costantino. At the 1956 Melbourne Olympics Fritz competed in both swimming and water polo. At the 1958 European Championships in Budapest he won a silver medal in the 4x200 m freestyle relay and a bronze medal with the 4x100 medley relay. His target was the 1960 Roma Olympics and, in the spring of 1960, he set a European record in the 200 butterfly with 2:18.0. The Dennerlein brothers decided to have Fritz concentrate on the butterfly and skip the water polo event. Fritz finished fourth in the Olympic final with a European record of 2:16.0 but had to watch as the Italian team won Olympic gold in the water polo tournament. In 1962, in a time trial in Monte Carlo, Dennerlein recorded 2:12.6. At the Tokyo Olympics he placed fourth with the water polo team. After ending his playing days (22 national titles as a swimmer) he dedicated himself to training, becoming the coach of Canottieri Napoli, with whom he won two championships in water polo (1975, 1977) and a European Champions Cup in 1978. Dennerlein was technical coach of the national team from 1984 to 1990, abd won a silver at the 1986 Madrid World Championships, after a long match with Yugoslavia, and a European bronze at Strasbourg in 1987.","Brother of Costantino Dennerlein Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the Summer Universiade (3–2–2 1959 Torino SWI gold: 200 m butterfly, 4×200 m freestyle relay, and 4×100 m medley relay, WAP bronze; 1963 Porto Alegre SWI silver: 200 m butterfly and 4×100 m medley relay, bronze: 4×100 m freestyle relay) Listed in Olympians Who Set a European Record in Long Course Swimming (100 m butterfly – 12 July 1959 - 11 March 1961: 1:01.8 (12 July 1959; Paris, FRA); 200 m butterfly – 14 July 1959 - 9 April 1960, 24 April 1960 - 22 July 1962, and 23 August 1962 - 18 May 1964: 2:19.5 (14 July 1959; Paris, FRA), 2:18.0 (24 April 1960; Roma, ITA), 2:16.0 (2 September 1960; Roma, ITA), 2:12.6 (23 August 1962; Monte Carlo, MON)) Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the European Aquatics Championships (0–1–1 1958 Budapest SWM silver: 4×200 m freestyle relay, bronze: 4×100 m medley relay) Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the Mediterranean Games (6–1–0 1955 Barcelona WAP gold; 1959 Beirut SWI gold: 200 m butterfly, 4×200 m freestyle relay, and 4×100 m medley relay, WAP silver; 1963 Napoli SWI gold: 200 m butterfly, WAP gold) Listed in Olympians Who Died in Motor Vehicle Accidents (Boat/Car/Motorcycle/Train) (Died in a car accident.)"

85413,Eddie Edwards,Male,5 December 1963,173.0,74, Great Britain,GBR,"Michael Thomas “Eddie” Edwards, a plasterer from Cheltenham with poor eyesight, went to the 1988 Calgary Winter Olympics as the best British ski jumper. With no chance of a medal, he arrived at Calgary Airport to be greeted by a group of fans carrying a banner saying: “Welcome to Calgary, Eddie The Eagle”, and that nickname stuck. He came as a no-hoper and left Calgary as a worldwide hero. From that you would think he came away from the Games as a surprise medalist. None of it; despite setting British records in both the Normal and Large Hill events, he came last in both. What Edwards did, however, was exemplify the spirit of the Olympic movement in an era when winning was important. He actually asked the question at those Games: “Where is it written that Olympics are only for winners?” Edwards started skiing at the age of 13 after a failed footballing career. As a decent downhiller, he had visions of getting on to the British skiing team, but when that failed he turned to ski jumping, financing himself along the way. He got his big break in 1987 when he was living and working in Finland and was invited to go to the World Skiing Championships in Oberstdorf, West Germany, having taken part in a World Cup event in the same town seven weeks earlier. Edwards then went to the Calgary Olympics the following year with four other World Cup performances behind him, but his run of failure continued. Edwards, however, would turn that failure into success. After the Calgary Olympics, Edwards was in demand for television, and public appearances, and once appeared on the Johnny Carson Show in the United States. Edwards suddenly went from being a £5,000-a-year plasterer, to a £10,000-an-hour speaker, and in the three years after his Calgary exploits, he was reputed to have earned £1 million. Sadly, financial mismanagement resulted him subsequently filing for bankruptcy. Edwards continued training, but in 1990 stricter qualification rules were imposed and they made it virtually impossible for Edwards to qualify for major international events, and when the IOC implemented the “Eddie the Eagle Rule”, any chance of him competing at the 1992 Winer Olympics were gone. To make matters worse, Edwards lost his “British No.1” ranking in 1993 when James Lambert took it off him. Four years later at Lake Placid, however, Edwards did enjoy one of the best results of his career when he finished 36th out of 44. Edwards was trying to rebuild a career for himself and studied to be a solicitor. At the age of 36 he secured a place at Leicester University to study law, and four years later graduated with a degree in law. While studying, he continued to run a ski training school and a PR company. Between 2014-17 he was part of the Channel 4 winter sports TV programme “The Jump”, and in 2016 the full-length feature film “Eddie the Eagle” was released. It starred Taron Egerton as Edwards, and also featuring Hugh Jackman and Jim Broadbent. It grossed around $16 million, a long way short of the $149.9 million grossed by “Cool Runnings”, the film about the Jamaican bobsleigh team, also at the 1988 Calgary Olympics. Eddie “The Eagle” Edwards was the first British ski jumper to ever compete at the Olympics. He was nowhere near to winning a medal, but he did become an Olympic and sporting icon.",

After his début at the European Championships, he performed well in his first World Championships two weeks later. After three distances, Van der Grift was in fourth place, having placed fifth in both 500 and 1,500 m. He finished last in the 10,000 m however, and dropped back to 11th in the final classification. His Olympic début, at the fast high altitude rink of Squaw Valley, ended with a 10th place in the 500 m, and a fall in the 1,500. Van der Grift was not satisfied with the training possibilities in the Netherlands at the time, as there was no rink with artificial ice yet, so he moved to the Norwegian town of Fagernes, where he became a car mechanic. The move paid off, and at the next European Championships, in Helsinki, he was the surprise of the tournament. He took the silver medal behind Olympic champion Viktor Kosichkin, the first one for the Dutch since 1953. This result instantly made him one of the favorites for the World Championships, which were to be held on the artificial ice of Nya Ullevi in Göteborg. This event started well for Van der Grift, placing second in the 500 m only behind sprinter Grishin, but he lost quite a lot in the 5,000 m, making his compatriot Rudi Liebrechts the leader after day one. A 1,500 m victory on Sunday put Van der Grift in the lead, earning a 21-second margin on stayer Kosichkin. During his 10,000 m race, it looked like Van der Grift would not win, as he lost about one second to the Russian every lap. However, he managed to push out two fast final laps, fast enough to retain the lead, and become the first Dutch World Champion since Coen de Koning in 1905. His struggle in the final distance not only won him the title, but he was also awarded the Oscarstatuetten for this performance. In 1962 Van der Grift was slightly less successful, but the Dutch title, a fourth place in the European Championships and the silver medal at the World Championships, where Kosichkin won in front of a massive home crowd, were still excellent performances. Before the 1962/1963 season, he moved back to the Netherlands, but due to illness, performed poorly at the international events and didn’t qualify for the final distance at Worlds, and retired after that season.

In 1984 he was named to the Boston-based US Court of Appeals court, and he became chief justice of that court from 1994-2001. He was the first Hispanic member of the First Circuit court. Torruella stood up for the rights of his native Puerto Rican citizens several times and also supported the rights of Hispanic citizens. Because of Insular Case law, decided by the US Supreme Court in 1901, citizens of US territories do not receive full rights of US citizens, something that Torruella fought to overturn. He also fought against Puerto Rican citizens discrimination in US Supplemental Security Income cases. Perhaps his most publicized case came when Torruella ruled on the appeal of 2013 Boston Marathon bomber and murderer Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, which overturned his death sentence.","Father of Juan Torruella, Jr. Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the Central American and Caribbean Games (0–2–0 1966 San Juan SAI silver: Finn; 1974 Santo Domingo SAI silver: Flying Dutchman) Listed in Olympic Order Recipients (1998 (Silver))"

Kerly also won silver medals at the 1986 World Cup and the 1987 European Cup and was a member of the Southgate team which won the English Club Championship in 1987 and 1988. In his 74 matches for Great Britain he scored 57 goals and also played for England in 58 outdoor and nine indoor internationals. Extensive television coverage focused attention on his scoring feats and, unusually for a hockey player, he became one of Britain’s best known sportsmen. The strictly amateur nature of the game precluded Kerly from benefiting financially from the publicity and shortly before the 1988 Olympics he lost his job as a buyer for a fashion chain due to demands made on his time by training and competition. The necessity of earning a living, coupled with a certain loss of form, eventually obliged him to take a break from international hockey, although he continues to play for Southgate in the National League.",

138,Boris Becker,Male,22 November 1967,192.0,85, Germany,GER,"German tennis player Boris “Boom Boom” Becker only played one Olympic tournament, at Barcelona in 1992, where he sensationally won the doubles title with Michael Stich. This was more remarkable because the two were not the best-of-friends, and their rivalry was well publicised by the yellow and sports press in Germany throughout their careers. In the Barcelona single’s tournament, Becker surprisingly lost his third-round match to Frenchman Fabrice Santoro, despite being one of the pre-tournament favourites. Becker and Steffi Graf were mainly responsible for the tennis boom in Germany in the 1980s and 90s. At Wimbledon in 1985, Becker won the first Grand Slam title by a German. He was just 17-years-of-age at the time and was the youngest Wimbledon winner ever (as of 2022), and was also the first unseeded player to win the men’s singles title, since the introduction of seedings in 1924. Becker defended this title in 1986, and won it again in 1989. He also won the Australian Open in 1991 and 1996, and the US Open in 1989. He never won the French Open, however, or any other major tournament on clay. From 1991, he was world ranked #1 for 12 weeks and won the tour finals in 1988, 1992, and 1995. In total, Becker won 49 single’s tournaments. Becker won his first Grand-Prix tournament at Queen’s in 1985 only a few weeks before Wimbledon. He was then coached by Romanian-born Günther Bosch and managed by former ice hockey and tennis player Ion Țiriac. Becker was the Sportsman of the Year in Germany that year, and again in 1986, 1989, and 1990. He also helped Germany win the Davis Cup in 1988 and 1989, and partnered with Anke Huber to win the Hopman Cup in 1995. Becker was European Sportsman of the Year in 1986 and 1989. From 1997-99, he was captain of the German Davis Cup team. Becker was awarded the Silver Bay Leaf, Germany’s highest sports award in 1985, when he also received the German media prize Bambi. In 1999 and 2018, he received the German TV prize together with Steffi Graf and Michael Stich, respectively. In 2003, Becker was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame and in 2015, into the German Sports Hall of Fame. Becker later briefly turned to coaching and coached Novak Đoković from 2013-16. Since 2002, Becker has been a commentator for the BBC at Wimbledon and from 2017, as an expert on the German Eurosport TV channel. That same year he was named head of men’s tennis by the German Tennis Federation. At times Becker struggled with his early success and fame and his personal life has been turbulent. He tried to play poker professionally and worked with an online poker company, had tax evasions, and was declared bankrupt in London. Becker was sentenced to two years’ probation and received a fine of 300,000 euros by the München district court for tax evasion in 2002. He also fell foul of the planning authorities for permissions in Mallorca for his multi-million euro villa near Artà, which he eventually gave up in 2020 after further problems with builders and squatters. In 2022 he was sentenced to 2.5 years in prison for breaching bankruptcy laws during his bankruptcy proceedings in London. Becker had several relationships that were heavily reported on in the yellow press. From 1993-2001 he was married to former actress Barbara Feltus, raising three children. He later married Sharlely “Lilly” Kerssenberg (2009-18) and had another son. He divorced in both cases. Becker also had a sexual encounter in a broom cupboard with waitress Angela Ermakova at a London restaurant, which resulted in the birth of his daughter Anna. Becker was later engaged to, among others, German rapper Sabrina Setlur, and models Heydi Núñez Gómez, and Sandy Meyer-Wölden, whose father was Becker’s former adviser and manager. Becker lived in Wimbledon, within walking distance of the championship grounds, which he called his “living room”. He also owned apartments in München, Monaco, Miami and Schwyz.","Listed in Olympians With Animals Named After Them (Bufonaria borisbeckeri, a sea snail) Listed in Olympians Who Were Elected German Athlete of the Year (1985, 1986, 1989, 1990) Listed in Olympic Champions Who Have Played in a Davis Cup Final Winning Team (Olympic Gold - 1992; Davis Cup - 1988 / 1989) Listed in Olympians Who Were Named BBC World Sport Star of the Year (1985) Listed in Olympians Who Were Sent to Prison (In 2022 Becker was sentenced to 2.5 years in prison for breaching bankruptcy laws during his bankruptcy proceedings in London.)"

69151,Jim Hogan,Male,28 May 1933,175.0,69, Great Britain  Ireland,GBR,"Born as one of nine children in a farming family in County Limerick, Jim Cregan had success locally and nationally in Ireland as a cross-country runner. He retired from the sport at the young age of 26 and he moved to England in 1960 to find work. He rediscovered the urge to run and soon changed his name by deed poll from Cregan to Hogan in the mistaken belief that this was needed to enable him to compete in Britain. His performances in England brought him to the attention of the Irish selectors who chose him to compete at 10,000 metres and marathon at the Tokyo Olympics. Hogan made little impression on the track but things were very different on the roads. For mile after mile Hogan battled the legendary Abebe Bikila over the marathon course until, with an unlikely silver medal seemingly within his grasp, dehydration forced his body to give up on him and he was forced to retire with just three miles remaining. By this time the ever opinionated Hogan was becoming disillusioned with the Irish athletics hierarchy, who he called the blazer-wearing brigade, and especially with what he felt was discrimination against athletes based in England. In 1965 he turned his back on the green vest of Ireland and decided to compete for Great Britain instead. It was in his new colours that he recorded the biggest victory of his career when he won the marathon at the 1966 European Championships finishing nearly two minutes clear of two-time Boston Marathon winner (1963-64) Aurèle Vandendriessche. He competed at the 1968 Olympics over 10,000 metres but age and altitude were against him and he finished 27th of the 32 finishers. During his career Hogan set a world best for 30km on the road, running 1:32:25, and also a European Indoor three-mile record of 13:37.2. Later in life Hogan returned to his native Limerick and to his first love of horses. He trained horses with some success in local point-to-point races well into the 21st century. Personal Bests: 10000 – 28:49.66 (1965); Mar – 2-19:27 (1966).",Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the European Athletics Championships (1–0–0 1966 Budapest gold: marathon (competed for Great Britain))

He then went to Paris for the Olympics, and returned home with a silver medal after losing on points in the all-British final to Harry Mallin. The contest was fought amidst pandemonium from a vociferous Paris crowd, who were still annoyed at the disqualification of their own fighter Roger Brousse in the quarter-final for biting Mallin. Eliott retained his ABA title in 1925 with a win over the Army’s Frank Crawley, and shortly afterwards engaged in contests in Boston and New York along with three fellow Olympians, Harry Mitchell, Patrick O’Hanrahan, and George Gogay. The home fans warmed to Elliott who was the only member of the quartet to return home undefeated. Selected for the inaugural European Amateur Boxing Championships at Stockholm in 1925, Elliott could not make the weight (he was selected as a cruiserweight) and did not take part. Shortly afterwards he announced he was turning professional. Unfortunately, the professional career of Jack Elliott was nowhere near as successful as his amateur one. He returned to the USA for his professional début against Tom Kirby in Revere, Massachusetts, but the referee stopped the fight in the second round of a scheduled eight-rounder, to prevent Elliott suffering further punishment. Elliott’s first seven fights were all in the USA and his next two wins were his only professional victories, losing nine and drawing one in his 12-fight career, which ended in 1930. Elliott fought in Australia towards the end of his career and after retiring from the ring went to live in the country and became a boxing correspondent for a Sydney publication.

He joined the National Skating Association in 1905 and set about changing the way British skaters performed, from a formal, to a more informal and free-flowing style. He took lessons from some of Europe’s best exponents and in the years immediately prior to the outbreak of World War I, won several titles with Mildred Allingham, whom he married in 1915. During the War, Richardson served as a captain in the Army, and after the hostilities, the duo picked up their skating careers and were runners-up in the 1923 British Championship, before going to Chamonix for the first Winter Olympics the following year. Richardson later became a skating judge, and wrote the internationally acclaimed book Modern Figure Skating amongst others. His other works saw him contribute to The Field, the Encyclopedia Britannica and Skating World, and he was also the winter sports correspondent for The Times from just after the end of World War II until 1958, when he then wrote for the Daily Telegraph for two years.

They met with immediate success and won the world coxed pair title in 1986 then followed this with gold in the coxless pairs and silver in the coxed event in 1987. Holmes and Redgrave attempted the pairs double at the Seoul Olympics and easily won the coxless event. The Italian Abbagnale brothers and the East Germans proved too good in the coxed pairs and, with Pat Sweeney, they placed third. Holmes also took two gold medals (coxed four and coxless pair) representing England at the 1986 Commonwealth Games. Following Seoul Holmes walked away from the sport and set up a removals business but, encouraged his daughter’s entry into the sport, he returned after a twenty year break to become director of rowing of two clubs including one based at the future Olympic rowing venue. In October 2010 he was rushed to hospital and diagnosed as suffering from leptospirosis, also called Weil’s disease. Although he appeared to be recovering he had suffered liver and kidney damage which was to prove fatal.",Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the British Empire/Commonwealth Games (2–0–0 1986 Edinburgh ROW gold: coxless pairs and coxed fours (competed for England))

After the tournament she was named MVP, the first of many awards that she would win in Calgary minor league hockey organizations. She participated in her first international competition with the Canadian Women’s National Team at the age of 15 and, as of 2010, has won six gold and three silver World Championship medals and has been named to the All-Star team four times. She was part of the Canadian squad that was sent to the inaugural women’s ice hockey competition at the 1998 Winter Olympics and took home the silver medal. She found even greater success in 2002, capturing the gold medal as well as being the tournament’s top scorer and MVP, a feat she repeated at the 2006 Games. At the 2010 Winter Olympics she recited the athlete’s oath at the opening ceremony, a testament to her considerable status in the Canadian hockey scene, and took home a third Olympic gold medal. Nationally she has won numerous national championships with the Edmonton Chimos and the Calgary Oval X-Treme and, in 2010, joined the University of Calgary Dinos for the 2010-2011 University season. Wickenheiser also played professional softball beginning in 1994, to considerable acclaim, and was named to the Canadian team for the 2000 Summer Olympics. Although she retired from this sport after these Olympics, she served as a colour commentator for the tournament at the 2008 Summer Olympics. In July 2006, the sport center in her hometown of Shaunavon, Saskatchewan was renamed “Wickenheiser Place”.",Recited the Athletes' Oath at the Opening Ceremony of the 2010 Winter Olympics Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the World Ice Hockey Championships (7–6–0 1994 Lake Placid gold; 1997 Kitchener gold; 1999 Espoo and Vantaa gold; 2000 Mississauga gold; 2004 Halifax and Dartmouth gold; 2005 Linköping and Norrköping silver; 2007 Winnipeg and Selkirk gold; 2008 Harbin silver; 2009 Hämeenlinna silver; 2011 Zürich and Winterthur silver; 2012 Burlington gold; 2013 Ottawa silver; 2016 Kamloops silver)

Her next major stop was the 2004 Summer Olympics, where her best individual event was the uneven bars (joint 48th) and she finished 12th in the team competition. After a slow year in 2005, during which her most significant competition was the 2005 East Asian Games, she made up for an unimpressive performance at the 2006 World Championships by winning a gold medal in the women’s uneven bars, silver medals in the women’s vault and artistic team competitions, and bronze in the all-around tournament at the 2006 Asian Games. She continued her success with a silver medal in the women’s vault event at the 2007 World Championships, but injured herself prior to the 2008 Summer Olympics and did not compete. Problems regarding age falsification began to surface in 2010 when Hong was registered for that year’s World Championships with a birth date of 9 March 1989, which would have made her too young to compete in 2003 or 2004. Prior to this time she had claimed her year of birth as 1985 and 1986 at various international tournaments. North Korea claimed that a secretary had confused her with her sister Hong Un-Jong, 2008 Olympic champion in the horse vault, who had always been listed as being born in 1989. Nevertheless in November 2010 the Fédération Internationale de Gymnastique stripped her of her results from 2003 and 2004, banned all North Korean gymnasts from participating internationally until October 2012, and levied a fine against the Gymnastics Association of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea.","Sister of Hong Un-Jong Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the Asian Games (1–1–1 2006 Doha GAR gold: uneven bars, silver: vault, bronze: all-around)"

However, it was not until 1907 that he gained national recognition when, as a member of Forest CC, he won the quarter-mile at the English Amateur Championship at Exeter, beating the Italian Guglielmo Morisetti into second place by five lengths. Anderson also finished third in the one-mile championship. That same year, he also won the Diamond Jubilee Gold Plate, a half-mile scratch race, at the annual Bath CC meeting. To make it a memorable year, Anderson also won the British Empire quarter-mile title at Gosforth, and was runner-up to Ben Jones in the half-mile. Runner-up to Ernie Payne at the Bath meeting in 1908, Anderson did lower the world record for the quarter-mile on grass from a standing start from 34 to 33 seconds. He then competed at the London Olympics, and shortly afterwards finished second to Dan Flynn in the quarter-mile at the British Empire Cycling Championships at the Belfast Oval. He was also second to Ben Jones n the half-mile again, but was on the England team that won the 10-mile team race. When Ernie Payne won the Bath Diamond Jubilee trophy for the third consecutive year in 1910, Anderson, who was now riding for Polytechnic RC, was again the runner-up.",

69577,Allan Wells,Male,3 May 1952,183.0,86, Great Britain,GBR,"Allan Wells began his athletic career by winning the 1970 Scottish Junior triple jump title and in 1972 he cleared a respectable 7.32 (24-0¼) in the long jump. But after seeing the Jamaican Don Quarrie win both sprints at the 1970 Commonwealth Games in Edinburgh, Wells decided to try the sprints himself, though it was not until 1976 that he first achieved a legal clocking of better than 11.0 for the 100 metres. Although he won the AAA Indoor 60 metres title in 1977, his outdoor season was relatively undistinguished. The following year, however, saw him establish himself as a world-class sprinter. His powerful physique and springing skills were developed by his coach Wilson Young, a former professional sprinter, although Young was unable to convince Wells of the merit of using starting blocks. In July 1978, Wells equalled Peter Radford’s 20-year-old UK 100 metres record of 10.29 and six days later he brought the record down to 10.15. The following month he showed magnificent form at the Commonwealth Games in Edmonton; in the 200 metres he set a UK record of 20.61 in the heats before running a wind-assisted 20.12 to win the final, while he won a second gold medal in the relay and a silver medal in the 100 metres. In 1979, Wells twice improved the UK 200 metres record and claimed a major scalp when he defeated the Italian Pietro Mennea at the European Cup final in Turin. Due to an alteration in IAAF rules, Wells we obliged to use starting blocks at the Moscow Olympics but he soon showed that he had adapted to the change by setting a UK record of 10.11 in the heats of the 100 metres. He went on to win a desperately close final – both he and the pre-race favorite, Silvio Leonard of Cuba, were given the same electronic time of 10.25 but it was Wells, at the age of 28, who became the oldest ever winner of the Olympic 100 metres title. He failed by the narrowest of margins to win the 200 metres and his time of 20.21 behind Mennea was a UK record. He claimed a third UK record as a member of the relay team that finished in fourth place. Although Wells had other successes ahead of him, his times in Moscow were to prove the fastest of his career without the benefit of wind assistance. With wins in the IAAF “golden sprints”, the World Cup and the European Cup in 1981, Wells confirmed his position at the top of world sprinting but his early form in 1982 was disappointing. However, in October at the Commonwealth Games in Brisbane he won the 100 metres and shared the 200 metres title with Mike McFarlane. In 1984, at 32, he made the Olympic team for a second time and although he was eliminated in the semi-finals of the 100 metres, he was a member of the relay team that did well to reach the final. The UK records of Wells, who was married to the international sprinter, Margot Wilkie, remained unbeaten until the emergence of Linford Christie. After retirement he worked as a coach for the British bobsleigh teams and remained involved in athletics through his wife’s Margot Wells School of Speed coaching programme.

Although a world class swimmer, he never showed his best at the Olympic Games. Faßnacht attended Long Beach State University in 1969 but struggled there. In 1968 at Mexico City he qualified for three finals, but finished only seventh in the 400 freestyle event (over 1,500 he was eliminated in the heats as the best non-qualifier), while in both freestyle relays he came in sixth. Four years later in München he again was the best non-qualifier for the final over 1,500 metres and was also eliminated in the 400 freestyle heats. Nevertheless, he finished fifth in the 200 butterfly and sixth again with the 4x100 freestyle relay. His greatest moment came when he earned a silver medal with the 4x200 relay alongside Klaus Steinbach, Werner Lampe and Hans-Günther Vosseler. This nevertheless could not hide his disappointment at not winning an individual Olympic medal. During his active career Faßnacht won 12 West German titles and five US titles. He also set 45 German records, 22 European ones and two world records (1969: 400 freestyle in 4:04.0; 1971: 200 butterfly in 2:03.3). In 1970 he earned three golds and three silvers at the European Championships. Faßnacht later immigrated to France and then to the USA in the 1980s to be employed by swimwear companies as a marketing manager. In 1992 he was inducted into the International Swimming Hall of Fame. In 1970 he had been awarded the Silver Bay Leaf, Germany’s highest sports award.","Listed in Olympians Who Set a European Record in Long Course Swimming (200 m freestyle – 15 August 1969 - 29 August 1972: 1:56.5 (15 August 1969; Louisville, USA), 1:56.4 (8 September 1970; Barcelona, ESP), 1:55.2 (9 September 1970; Barcelona, ESP); 400 m freestyle – 11 July 1969 - 7 September 1970: 4:08.2 (11 July 1969; Santa Clara, USA), 4:06.9 (1 August 1969; Louisville, USA), 4:04.0 (14 August 1969; Louisville, USA); 800 m freestyle – 11 September 1970 - 22 August 1971: 8:41.4 (11 September 1970; Barcelona, ESP), 8:38.4 (8 August 1971; Los Angeles, USA); 1500 m freestyle – 18 August 1968 - 7 August 1970 and 11 September 1970 - 4 September 1972: 16:46.7 (18 August 1968; Wuppertal, FRG), 16:36.8 (13 July 1969; Santa Clara, USA), 16:32.1 (3 August 1969; Los Angeles, USA), 16:19.9 (11 September 1970; Barcelona, ESP); 200 m butterfly – 22 August 1970 - 15 March 1975: 2:06.9 (22 August 1970; Los Angeles, USA), 2:06.5 (10 July 1971; Santa Clara, USA), 2:06.1 (10 July 1971; Santa Clara, USA), 2:06.0 (7 August 1971; Santa Clara, USA), 2:04.5 (29 August 1971; Uppsala, SWE), 2:03.3 (31 August 1971; Landskrona, SWE); 400 m medley – 2 August 1969 - 7 September 1970: 4:43.0 (2 August 1969; Los Angeles, USA), 4:42.5 (24 August 1969; Würzburg, FRG); 4×200 m freestyle relay – 12 September 1970 - 21 August 1974: 7:49.5 (12 September 1970; Barcelona, ESP), 7:41.69 (29 August 1972; München, FRG)) Listed in Olympians Who Set a World Record in Long Course Swimming (400 m freestyle – 14 August 1969 - 20 August 1970: 4:04.0 (14 August 1969; Louisville, USA); 200 m butterfly – 31 August 1971 - 2 August 1972: 2:03.3 (31 August 1971; Landskrona, SWE)) Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the European Aquatics Championships (3–3–0 1970 Barcelona SWM gold: 200 m freestyle, 1500 m freestyle, and 4×200 m freestyle relay, silver: 400 m freestyle, 400 m medley, and 4×100 m freestyle relay) Listed in Olympians Who Were Elected German Athlete of the Year (1969, 1970, 1971)"

Hermann was initially employed by the state railways, but went on to become a journalist, at “Ekstra Bladet”, from 1915. Later, he joined “BT”, “Sport Magazine” and “Social Democrat”. He was editor of the weekly magazine “Sport” in 1931-32. In the years 1912-42 he published a total of eight collections of poetry. During World War I, he adopted the style of the Dada movement and wrote the nonsense poem Futurism. Later he turned to children’s and youth books, under his pseudonyms Erik Haagensen, Julie Saabye and Max Wahl. Several of these books became quite popular. In 1941 he won the competition for a cantata for the occasion of the opening of a new broadcasting building. This premiered in 1945 after the end of the German occupation.

Koh was born under the Chinese name Jiang Wen-Ye in Taiwan, which at that time was under Japanese occupation. Koh was a composer who worked mainly in Japan under his Japanese name. He produced a wide range of music, from piano to choral and orchestral works, and merged elements of traditional Chinese, Taiwanese, and Japanese music with modernist influences and was called the “Taiwanese Chopin.” Koh attended school in Nagano, Japan and then majored in electrical engineering at the Tokyo Engineering and Commerce Advanced School. He started his career as a singer, but then studied composition. As a well-known baritone, he performed several operas for the first time in Japan, including La Boheme by Puccini and Tannhäuser by Richard Wagner. Since 1938 Koh was also a teacher at the Beijing Normal University. After World War II, Koh left his Japanese family and returned to mainland China, where he was stripped of his (Japanese) nationality, and considered a traitor. Under the Kuomintang-Regime he was thus imprisoned. Nevertheless, he was appointed professor at the Beijing Central Conservatory in 1947 and started a new Chinese family. After the founding of the People’s Republic of China he became a professor at the Tianjin Central Conservatory. He had to change his composition style to be more moderate in accordance with the ruling party, and was a political target because of his earlier ties to Japan. In the course of the Anti-Rightist-Movement in 1957 and the Culture Revolution in 1966 he was denounced as a “henchman of Japanese imperialism” and sent to a labor camp and much of his work was destroyed. After the end of the Cultural Revolution he was rehabilitated but his health had deteriorated and he died from a stroke a few years later. The piano version of the Formosan Dance was written in April 1934, while its orchestral version was completed in August of the same year. It was originally planned only as part of a longer composition but eventually became an independent work as his Opus 1 with the sequence allegro – moderato - allegro. The orchestral version is played by 2 flutes, 2 oboes, 2 clarinets, 2 bassoons, 4 horns, 2 trumpets, 3 trombones, 1 tuba, 1 timpano, 1 piano, and strings. Unlike most other compositions presented at Olympic Arts Competitions, the 8-9 minute-long work has become quite popular and has been recorded several times.",

During this period he represented Canada at two Summer Olympic Games, even though he never became a citizen of the country. He was eliminated in the first round of the springboard diving, 100 metre freestyle, and 100 metre backstroke events in 1908 and placed fifth in the springboard competition in 1912. His athletic talents took him beyond swimming and diving as well: in addition to being one of Montreal’s top water polo players from 1905 through 1912, he competed in football, basketball, canoe racing, bowling, and ice hockey and was given an opportunity to try out as a pitcher for the Boston Red Sox, although he injured his arm shortly before the trial. During his career he would compete for “whichever club was the best in each sport”. Outside of active competition Zimmerman worked as a lecturer, draftsman, deep sea diver, movie underwater stuntman, and swimming coach. Among his students was Canadian 1912 double Olympic gold medalist George Hodgson.

His father was Charles Lane Poor, a famous astronomer. Alfred studied at Harvard and at the University of Pennsylvania under Paul Philippe Cret. Thanks to a scholarship he was able to spend his final year in Paris at the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris and the American Academy in Roma. He served in the Navy in both World Wars. His projects, predominantly in the neoclassical style, are mostly located in New York City and in Washington, DC, where he worked for the Federal Government. He was also the principal architect for the US Library of Congress’ James Madison Memorial Building. Some of his projects in New York were the Jacob K. Javits Federal Building, the Queens County Courthouse and Prison in Kew Gardens, the Home Insurance Company Building, and the Red Hook housing project, but also included numerous branch offices of major banks and country homes. In Philadelphia he built the Annenberg School on the campus of his former university. In 1931, they designed the Cape Cinema in Dennis, Massachusetts, a building which is still in operation with a New England style exterior contrasting with a wonderful Art Deco Interior. His graphic work mostly comprised architectural motives, and he also authored a number of books on design and architecture. From 1966-77 Poor was the president of the National Academy of Design in New York. One of his most prominent works is the Wright Brothers National Memorial, which he designed together with Robert Rodgers and submitted to the 1932 architecture competition. In 1930, the partners were awarded the commission for the Wright Brothers National Memorial to be erected at Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, where the Wright brothers made their first powered flights in 1903. The design of this memorial was submitted for the 1932 art competition. The monument, built in 1931-32, represents a stylized wing. It is about 18 m high, consists of about 1,200 tons of granite and stands on a foundation in the form of a five-pointed star, similar to the Statue of Liberty in the harbor entrance of New York. In 1936, Poor submitted a project for the Airport in Rio de Janeiro. In the same year, Calabouço Airport (today Santos Dumont Airport) was opened based on plans of a Brazilian architecture firm.

She won the ASA junior girls’ 100 yards freestyle title in a time of 62.9 sec, 0.6 sec faster than the senior winner. Her winning time was a record that stood for six years. She went on to win Sussex and Southern Counties titles and, when she was selected for the 1952 Olympics, her local baths in Worthing stayed open for two extra months in the winter period so she could continue with her training programme. Barnwell never won a medal in Helsinki but thousands lined the streets of her home-town to welcome the schoolgirl back. She was lucky, however, to compete at the Games at all. Just four days before her first race, she was hit by a tram on the streets of Helsinki because, as she said, she forgot the traffic in Finland was on the “wrong side of the road”. Barnwell was expected to make the British squad for her second Olympics in 1956 but, following a move to London and change of coach, her form dipped dramatically. Despite getting rid of the coach, it was too late to get her season back on track in time for Olympic selection. Barnwell married the former Great Britain water polo captain Duncan Kemp in 1958 and they had a daughter but, when her daughter was just four years of age, Barnwell was admitted to St. Bart’s hospital in London with Hodgkin’s Disease.

This quickly brought him success as he performed well in university and college national championships. Zarándi finally decided on athletics at the age of twenty in 1949, after defeating his friend Géza Varasdi in the 100 metres. At that time the Hungarian 4x100 relay was already formed, in which from 1951 György Csányi and Béla Goldoványi started alongside Zarándi and Varasdi, and received the name “lightning sticks”. The team won the bronze medal at the 1952 Helsinki Olympics, behind the United States and the Soviet Union, which was a sensational result, and then went undefeated for two years, including coming first at the 1954 European Championships in Bern. Zarándi could not go to the 1956 Melbourne Olympics with the team, due to an injury, which ultimately did not even make it to the finals.

Bertazzolo suffered a defeat in his pro début by disqualification but then recorded victories in 16 of his next 17 fights which included wins over the future European champion Pierre Charles as well as a number of other good fighters. This earned him a European title fight against Britain’s Phil Scott at the Royal Albert Hall in London in January 1927 where the Italian was once again disqualified. In his next fight Bertazzolo ousted Erminio Spalla from his position of Italian champion. Unfortunately, after a draw with George Cook and a defeat in Denmark against Knute Hansen, Bertazzolo was banned by the F.P.I. (the Italian Boxing Federation) for his behaviour during quarrels with his manager and stripped him of his championship. In 1929 Bertazzolo left for America where he began his stay with a trio of victories but then lost against several prominent contenders like Johnny Risko, Ted Sandwina and Charley Retzlaff . He also fought future world champion Primo Carnera in a bout contested between the two best Italian heavyweights of the time in Atlantic City. Bertazzolo was a colourful figure who would take his pet lion for walks around the streets of Milano and had a tattoo of a woman on his chest so, he claimed, his more chivalrous opponents would avoid so as not to be seen striking a woman.",

Three of four brothers played football while the four sisters were all keen swimmers. Ernst joined Schwaben Augsburg when he was 8-years-old. At the age of 18 he was promoted to the club’s first team, for which he would play more than 500 matches. At the age of 21, the talented forward got his first international chance in a match against Switzerland in November 1933, when an injury sidelined the stater. Lehner took advantage of this opportunity and soon moved into the starting line-up. Of the 100 international matches played by Germany until the end of his international career, he appeared in 65, scoring 31 goals to become Germany’s record scorer at the time. Lehner’s specialty was corner kicks, quite often directly turning them into goals, even twice in a match against Estonia in August 1937. He took part in the 1934 and 1938 World Cups, playing six matches, was selected for the team of Western Europe in 1937 and was a member of the famous “Breslau 11.” In the 1930s he was considered the world’s best amateur player. In 1940 he went to join Blau-Weiß 90 Berlin, only to return to his home town Augsburg in 1942. After World War II he continued to play for Viktoria Aschaffenburg in the Southern Division of the “Oberliga” (Upper League). Later he coached Darmstadt 98, Viktoria Aschaffenburg and Hanau 93. He lived in Aschaffenburg because the local administration had offered him a job, unlike his home town of Augsburg. From 1947 until his retirement in 1978 he was the head of the city’s sports bureau. As a tribute the stadium of Schwaben Augsburg bears his name.",

He was an early Naval aviator who flew seaplanes, torpedo planes, and amphibians. In World War II Gallery commanded the Fleet Air Base in Reykjavik, Iceland, where he earned a Bronze Star for his actions against German submarines. In 1943 he became commander of the USS Guadalcanal, and led Task Group 22.3. With TG 22.3 he is best known for capturing and boarding a German U-boat. Task Group 22.3 was awarded the Presidential Unit Citation and Captain Gallery received the Distinguished Service Medal for capturing U-505. Gallery was put in command of the aircraft carrier USS Hancock near the end of the war. Gallery was later promoted to rear admiral and became Assistant to the Chief of Naval Operations. During the Korean War, he commanded Carrier Division Six. Gallery became embroiled in a dispute when plans were made to merge the Marines into the Army. He wrote a series of articles in The Saturday Evening Post that were so inflammatory that Gallery was fortunate to not be court-martialed for insubordination. The episode, however, prevented his promotion to Vice Admiral. His final command was in Puerto Rico with the 10th Naval District. While there he established the first Little Leagues on Puerto Rico and the first military steel band in 1957. The 10th Naval District Steel Band became the US Navy Steel Band, but called themselves Admiral Dan’s Pandemoniacs. Gallery was profiled out of the Navy in 1960 for medical reasons.",

At the time, Masquilier was the president of the Sporting Club Tourquennois and director of general store in Tourcoing. The chorus of the cantata is conveyed as follows: “Honor to you intrepid athletes, girded with laurels, so worthily conquered! Let us sing the heroes of our feasts, and glory to our valiant friends! International Challenge of the North.” Obviously, neither the text nor the music came from Masquilier. A piano score of the “cantata for choir with four men’s voices accompanied by brass band or orchestra” that was published in 1899 says that the text was written by Jules Pierre Joseph Rosoor (14 April 1852–22 April 1923) and the music composed by Jehan Roland (probably from Switzerland).

He entered grand prix jumping in 1992 and, within one year, was named to the Canadian national team, making his first major appearance at the 1994 World Equestrian Games. His career was nearly derailed in 1996, however, when his drug tests for the 1996 Summer Olympics came up positive for cocaine. He received a four-year suspension and was barred from participating in the Games. It was later decided that his personal circumstances – growing up with a mother who dealt drugs most prominent among them – were sufficient to have his ban lifted in time to participate at the 1998 World Equestrian Games. One year later he picked up a bronze medal in the team jumping event at the 1999 Pan American Games. Lamaze was then offered an opportunity to represent his country at the 2000 Summer Olympics, but received lifetime banishment from the sport after testing for a forbidden stimulant. Believing his career to be over, he went to a party immediately after hearing his result and smoked a cigarette laced with cocaine. Less than two days later, however, the test that he failed was stricken from the record and he was given another opportunity to pass it and attend the Games. He failed again, this time for cocaine, and although he again avoided a lifelong ban, Canadian officials still refused to send him to Sydney. Lamaze made one more comeback attempt and, by 2008, had become the first Canadian equestrian in two decades to be ranked among the top ten in the world. He also had two more Pan American medals under his belt from 2007: silver from the team jumping competition and bronze in the individual. In 2008 he finally made it to the Olympics and did not disappoint, capturing gold in the individual jumping tournament and silver in the team version. Although his champion horse Hickstead died in November 2011, Lamaze decided against retirement in the hopes of finding another to compete with for the 2012 Summer Olympics, where he finished 29th in the individual event and 5th in the team competition. Lamaze finally completed his medal collection at the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Olympics, when he took bronze individually and fourth in the team event. In-between, he won the team jumping event at the 2015 Pan American Games. After learning he had brain cancer, he took some time off, but kept his diagnosis a secret and returned to compete at the 2018 World Championships, with less success. He revealed his diagnosis publically in 2019 but continued to vie for a spot on the 2020 Tokyo Olympic team, until concerns about the pandemic caused him to withdraw from consideration after the Games were delayed.","Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the Summer Pan American Games (1–1–2 1999 Winnipeg EQU bronze: jumping team; 2007 Rio de Janeiro EQU silver: jumping team, bronze: jumping individual; 2015 Toronto EQU gold: jumping team) Listed in Doping Irregularities at the Olympics (2000 Sydney – Out-of-competition positive.

He was the first speed skater to accomplish this feat, competing in 6 consecutive Games between 1968 and 1988. Coates had retired after the 1984 Olympics to become a coach, but confronted with the fast indoor oval at Calgary, he decided to compete in the 10,000 m event and try to beat his personal best. Because Australia was only allotted one spot, he replaced his pupil, Danny Kah, who instead coached his 41-year-old coach in this race. A long distance specialist, Coates’s best Olympic performance came in 1976, when he finished 6th in the 10k. Outside of the Games, he reached the final distance of the World Championships on eight occasions in the 1970s. His best result came in 1973, when he placed 11th after a 4th place in the 10,000.

He beat world record holder O’Brien and former record holder, Jim Fuchs, at the 1952 Final Trials, and only lost the Olympic title to O’Brien by a mere two centimetres. His winning throw of 57-1⅝ (17.41) at the 1952 Trials was the best mark of his career and would have sufficed to win the Olympic gold medal had he been able to repeat the performance at Helsinki. At Texas A&M, Hooper was NCAA champion in 1951, defeating O’Brien, but then was runner-up to O’Brien at the 1953 and 1954 NCAA Meet. At Texas A&M Hooper also played football, appearing variously at quarterback, halfback, tight end, and place kicker. He was approached by the New York Giants in 1953-54 but opted instead to join the Air Force, where he served as a second lieutenant. After his service he began work in engineering for Gifford Hill, Texas Laboratories. In 1977 he opened his own engineering firm, Hooper Engineering Laboratories. He led the company until he retired in 1999. In 1992 Hooper endowed the Spencer Buchanan Chair in civil engineering at Texas A&M, and also established a President’s Endowed Scholarship in the name of his longtime favorite coach, Colonel Frank Anderson.
