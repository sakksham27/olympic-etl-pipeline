He successfully defended his Olympic title in 2004 making him the first Iranian athlete to have ever won two Olympic gold medals. Rezazedah also set and broke many world records in his weight class in the clean and jerk and total. After his success in Sydney in 2000 and his gold medal performance at the 2003 World Championships in Vancouver, the Turkish Weightlifting Federation offered Reza Zedah a lucrative monthly stipend, a luxury villa, and a $10 million (USD) bonus if he would leave Iran and compete for Turkey. Rezazedah turned down the offer because of his love for his homeland and his people. One of Iran’s most popular celebrities, Reza Zedah is frequently seen on TV and in the news. His wedding in February 2003, held in the Saudi Arabian city of Mecca, was broadcast live on state television in Iran. Four times he has been named Iranian Sportsperson of the Year – more than any other in the country’s history. In 2006, the Reza Zedah Stadium was built in his hometown to honour his achievements and it is one of the most modern facilities in Iran. Once he retired from sport, Reza Zedah was appointed as the Prime Counselor for Iranian National Weightlifting Federation.

Fukuda played Davis Cup for Japan from 1923-25, appearing in four ties, winning two matches and losing three. He also played at the US Championships from 1923-25, making the third round of singles in 1924. Because part of the sports grounds of Waseda University were owned by the Fukuda family, Fukuda enjoyed sports from a very young age. He started playing tennis at the age of 13 when he entered high school in 1910. But it was not before 1920 that Waseda and Fukuda switched to the Western type of “hard tennis”. At the first All-Japan Tennis Championships in 1922, Fukuda defeated Takeichi Harada in the fourth round, eventually winning the tournament. This earned him a place on the Japanese Davis Cup team in the following year. Japan lost to Australia 4-1 in the final. Fukuda then decided to change from a Western grip to the Eastern grip. After playing overseas until 1925, he returned to Japan. During his time on the tour, Fukuda continuously sent reports to the Tokyo newspaper Nichiichi Shimbun (now Mainichi Shimbun), which gained him some fame as a sports reporter. In 1926, he married Fumiko Tamura, who won the ladies doubles at the 1923 Far Eastern Games. Later he continued to work as a sports journalist and organized tennis tournaments.

Steiner was part of the national team from 1957 to 1966, participating in two Olympics and three World Championships.

3466,"Con O'Kelly, Jr.",Male,11 March 1907,,, Great Britain,GBR,"Con O’Kelly’s father, also named Con, was the 1908 Olympic freestyle wrestling heavyweight gold medallist and later a professional boxer (1910-14). Con junior started attracting attention at the age of 15 after performing well in the 1922 English Schools Championships as a welterweight. It was not long before the youngster was fighting as a heavyweight and was the Northern Counties champion at that weight in 1924. O’Kelly competed at his one and only ABA Championships that year, losing to Harry Billings in the quarter-final. Having appeared at the Paris Olympics, and won at the prestigious Aonach Tailteann Boxing Championships, O’Kelly turned professional at the age of 17. O’Kelly went on to have 74 professional bouts with a 51-16-7 record. He never won a British title but fought some of the best heavyweights in the inter-War years and, between November 1928 and October 1932, fought in the United States, winning 14 of 23 bouts. He engaged in some memorable contests, including two against the leading US heavyweight King Levinsky. O’Kelly lost to a disputed decision at the Boston Arena in 1931 and, in the re-match in Chicago six months later, the two men fought a 10-round draw. After losing to Baxter Calmes in 1931, O’Kelly returned to England and had six years away from the ring. His return lasted just six bouts (all wins) before retiring following a points win over Cal Rooney at the Anfield Road football ground on 24 March 1938. Throughout his entire career, O’Kelly was knocked down just once. Despite being billed as another “Great White Hope” when he turned professional, O’Kelly never fought for a British title and the nearest he came was in winning the 1938 Northern Area heavyweight title by beating Harry Lister. On 10 May 1945, Con O’Kelly, Jr., was ordained as a Roman Catholic priest and over the years served parishes in Stockport, Ellesmere Port, Birkenhead, Alsager and Stalybridge. During his time at Stockport and Birkenhead, he started boxing clubs for young boys of the parish.","Son of Con O'Kelly, Sr."

920514,Alfred Munnings,Male,8 October 1878,,, Great Britain,GBR,"Sir Alfred Munnings was known as one of Britain’s finest painters of horses, and an outspoken enemy of Modernism. He became quite wealthy, as his paintings were collected by the Royal family and the high society. Munnings attended the Norwich School of Art and then became a full-time painter. Between 1912 and 1914, Munnings was a member of the Newlyn School, an artists’ colony in Cornwall, where he lived alongside fellow painters Dame Laura Knight and her husband, Harold. Munnings met his first wife Florence Carter Wood (1888–1914), who first tried to kill herself on their honeymoon and then did so in 1914. He was then remarried in 1920 to Violet McBride. During World War I he was an official war artist painting horse scenes in battles. Munnings was elected president of the Royal Academy of Art in 1944, and was awarded a knighthood the same year. His desire to make his paintings accessible after his 1959 death resulted in Lady Munnings opening Castle House to the public in 1961. Munnings participated in three Olympic Games in the Art Competitions (1928, 1932 and 1948) with several paintings. HRH the Prince of Wales on Forest Witch shows the later King Edward VIII as Prince of Wales on his horse Forest Witch. The 1921 painting was also distributed as a lithograph. When pieces from the late Edward’s Paris home were auctioned, the painting fetched the highest price ever paid for a Munnings’ painting in 1998, $2.3 million US. In the Morning, actually Early Morning on Manton Downs, was painted in 1926 in oil on canvas (76 x 101.5 cm.). The painting is shown in the 1928 catalog and was auctioned at Christie’s in 2011 for about 1.4 million euros. The painting was commissioned by Waldorf Astor and depicts the successful racehorse Short Story and his trainer Alec Taylor riding the gray Alberta on a morning ride near Marlborough in Wiltshire. In the early 1920s, Major Thomas Bouch, Master of the Belvoir Hounds, invited Munnings to visit Woolsthorpe to make a series of paintings of the dogs in his pack. This portrait Major T. Bouch and the Belvoir Hounds was painted during this visit. The following two works were probably also created during this stay. Morning at the Kennels is probably identical to The Belvoir Hunt - Hunting Morning at the Kennels. A very similar painting, however, is Belvoir Kennels. Since Hounds was also owned by Major Bouch in 1928, this painting may be actually Belvoir Hounds Exercising in the Park. There are also numerous prints of these original oil paintings on the market, some signed. His painting for the 1932 art competitions was, according to the catalog, titled Shooting Party in Field of Turnips. Originally, however, the painting was called Shooting Party in Field of Swedes. Both plants are different species of turnips. In 1948. Alfred Munnings exhibited a total of 25 paintings, but according to the catalog only one of them in the competition. This was Steeplechase - Going Down to the Start in oil on canvas (62.2 x 83.8 cm). Not in the competition was H.R.H. The Princess Royal on Horseback, painted around 1922 as a gift for Princess Mary, depicted on her grey horse Portumna. In 1931, this painting was exhibited in the Royal Academy show. In Mary’s possession in 1928 was also The Huntsman Short with Whips, which, however, could not be identified. In the saddling paddock, March meet, Cheltenham was a 1947 oil painting (101.6 x 158.1 cm), based on some very similar studies. Also reproduced in the 1948 catalog is Their Majesties’ Return from Ascot from 1925, now in the Tate Gallery (oil on canvas, 148 x 244.5 cm). Another 20 paintings by Munnings were exhibited in 1948. These were all preliminary studies for other paintings. Since there were often several studies for the same paintings and therefore identification by title is hardly possible, the Study of Hunter Cherry Bounce included in the exhibition catalog is a representative example. Cherry Bounce was a bay mare owned by Alfred Munnings. In 1943 he had two poems privately printed under the title Old Brandy and Cherry Bounce - A Ballad of Exmoor, Colchester as a small volume of 17 pages, which he apparently gave away to friends and acquaintances. He himself also contributed the illustrations. The other studies were painted in oil on wood panels between 1936 and 1948 in sizes of 25-40 cm x 40-60 cm. Most of them are in the possession of the Munnings Art Museum.",Listed in Olympian Members of the Nobility (Sir)

Fighting under the ring name Louis Cabo, he had a 10-year career as a professional from 1949 onwards. He won 31 of 59 fights which included two spells as national featherweight champion of Belgium between 1952 and 1955. His career highlight was probably a victory over world title challenger Cherif Hamia in Hamia’s native Algeria. Calebout later worked as a boxing trainer with Wimme Boxing Club Brugge.",

Solberg was not as successful at the World Championships, winning three silver medals in the biathlon relay in 1969-71, and bronze in the individual event in 1969 and 1971. His first major accomplishment was helping win the relay at the 1967 Nordic Championships, and winning the bronze medal in the individual at that competition. He won two further relay titles and added an individual silver at later Nordic Championships. Solberg was Norwegian Champion in 1982. In 1968 Solberg was awarded the Morgenbladets Gullmedalje. For his career achievements, he was chosen as the Norwegian flagbearer at the 1972 Winter Olympic Opening Ceremony, and in 1994 at Lillehammer, was one of the 16 former Norwegian athletes chosen to bring in the Olympic Flag at the Opening Ceremony. Solberg was a police officer by profession for most of his career. He is remembered in that regard for his work on a murder investigation against Fritz Moen.

He did so in 1949, winning the allround title by excelling in the long distances. That championship was also the last time Pajor represented Hungary: he defected from the then communist state, eventually settling in Sweden. Pajor did continue to skate, though, and in 1951 won a bronze in the World Championships as an independent athlete. From 1952 on, he represented his new home country, Sweden. For Sweden, he won a bronze in the 1952 Europeans, adding to the one he had won in 1949. His nationality change meant he couldn’t compete in the 1952 Olympics; Pajor had earlier competed in the 1948 St. Moritz Games, with a 4th place in the weather affected 10,000 m as his best performance. In 1949, on the high altitude rink of Davos, Pajor bettered the world record in the 5,000 m, lowering it by 0,2 of a second to 8:13.5. En route to his world title, he also bettered the 10,000 m world record, but it was bettered later in the same event, and is thus not officially recognized as a world record.

Her first season as a competitive archer was 1897 when she won the South of England Championships at Crystal Palace in her very first competition in public. Appleyard was a member of the Mid-Surrey Archery Club and was regularly amongst the prize-winners in club tournaments. However, on a national level, it was unfortunate for Appleyard that she was competing at the same time as two of the all-time great British female archers Lottie Dod and Queenie Newall. However, one of her finest achievements was in winning a silver medal at the 1907 Grand National Archery Meeting at Malvern. At the 1908 London Olympics, Appleyard was one of 25 all-Great Britain entrants in the women’s Double National Round and finished joint 11th, a long way behind the gold and silver medallists, Newell and Dod. When she married major general Frederick Appleyard in 1885, Gertrude Tuppen was just 19-years-of-age, and he was 36 years her senior. After her husband’s death in 1911, Appleyard relocated to Cheltenham, and competed regularly at meetings of the Cheltenham Archery Club, until her own death in 1917.

2302339,Alexander Lyle-Samuel,Male,10 August 1883,,, Great Britain,GBR,"Throughout his life, the name of Alexander Lyle-Samuel was very rarely off the pages of newspapers in both in the United Kingdom and United States. The son of a non-conformist Minister, Samuel was born in Birmingham and educated at the city’s King Edward’s School (attended shortly after Samuel by J. R. R. Tolkein), before going to Trinity College, Cambridge. He studied law at Cambridge and after working in the banking profession, became a journalist and then, in 1908, was admitted to the Middle Temple and practiced as a lawyer. He had the first of two bankruptcy orders made against him that same year (annulled in 1913) Samuel spent some time in the United States giving lectures, and during one of his visits his first wife died back in the UK in August 1914. Six months later, Samuel married American millionairess Julia Gertrude Lyle. Lyle, as Julia Hannon, worked as a nurse and following the death of John S. Lyle’s wife in 1907 she looked after him. He was a landowner, merchant, philanthropist, and one of the wealthiest men in New Jersey. In 1910, three years after meeting, the pair eloped to New York City and eventually married. She was 31 at the time and Lyle was 92 and estimated to be worth $20 million, quite a sum for 1910, and probably more than $500 million in 2020. She ended up a rich widow after less than three years of marriage, and in February 1915 married Alexander Samuel in a small ceremony at New York, just one month after meeting. Samuel then changed his name by deed poll to Lyle-Samuel. The couple returned to England and Lyle-Samuel served in World War I with the Territorial Force Reserve until invalided out in 1918, the same year that his brother George was killed in action. Also in 1918, Alexander became Liberal MP for the Eye division of Suffolk, a seat he held for five years, and served as the First Secretary to the Treasury for just over 18 months. Shortly after taking up his seat in Westminster he was involved in a much publicised libel case following allegations made against him during the election campaign, claiming in part he only married his two wives for their money! Lyle-Samuel won his case and £500 damages plus costs. After ending his political career, Lyle-Samuel returned to New York but continued to have mounting financial problems, and in 1928 faced a second bankruptcy order following debts of £2,434, a large part of which was owed to his oldest son Winston, who was killed in a bobsleigh accident in 1929, just a few months after the start of the bankruptcy hearing. Lyle-Samuel’s wife Julie died in 1939 and she left around $5 million in her will, but none of it went to Lyle-Samuel. He was found dead in his bed in a Manhattan Hotel room three years later.",

After their return home, most team participants were excluded from the reactionary German Gymnastics Association as they were “involved in a sporting event dedicated to internationalism.” The winning teams were banned from national competitions in Berlin. Hermann Weingärtner was a merchant, and later took over management of a swimming pool in Frankfurt am Oder, which had been established by his father.

They both won British Council grants to study in Britain and achieved places at the Slade School of Fine Arts in London, where they were influenced by British painter Stanley Spencer. They began their studies in Britain in Western Painting Techniques in 1946. After the communist takeover of China, they remained in Great Britain. She presented traditional Chinese painting skills all over the country and also presented Chinese cooking in the television, while her husband started an academic career. Chang worked as a calligrapher and therefore received orders to illustrate books of poems and several film-sets about China. One of her best friends was American comedian Bob Hope at that time. She also designed some work for famous fashion designer Christian Dior and sung in Peking Opera productions. After her husband’s death, Chang returned twice to Shanghai but found that she recognized nothing. She and her husband arranged that when they had both died, their ashes were to be scattered in front of the magnolia trees at Kenwood House, Hampstead. A work by Chang in ink and watercolor is titled “Two Sparrows Swaying on Hanging Willow Branches” (34 x 46 cm). The tendency to shorten the original titles could be observed in a number of cases.

Barkway attended Watford Grammar School, before going to Exeter College Oxford. He was an athletics Blue in 1948 and only an accident sustained while playing rugby prevented him from winning a second Blue in 1949. Having competed at the 1948 Olympics, he moved to Manchester University in 1950. That year he lost by inches to Hildreth in the AAA 110 yards hurdles final. A few months later, while coaching the Summer School at Loughborough College, Barkway was selected for the British team to go to the European Championships at Bruxelles. In 1951, he won his only international medal when he took the 100 metre hurdles bronze in the World Student Games at Luxembourg behind fellow Briton Paul Vine and the West German gold medalist Günther Thielmann. Sadly, Barkway lost his life at the age of 31. At the time he was a lieutenant in the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve, and was piloting a Royal Navy Avenger Torpedo Bomber on a training mission in Shropshire when it crashed into a field at Crab Tree Farm, Prees Heath near Whitchurch. Barkway and his co-pilot were killed, but the third member of the crew survived, unlike a cow from the farm, who also met his demise. On the same day that Barkway died, two passenger planes collided over the Grand Canyon killing over 100 people. At the time of his death, Barkway was the physical games master at Clifton College, Bristol and it was Barkway who fired the silver Smith & Wesson revolver to start the historical race at Iffley Road, Oxford, in May 1954, when Roger Bannister, a fellow Oxford Blue, broke the four-minute barrier for the mile.

921040,Ángel Zárraga,Male,16 August 1886,,, Mexico,MEX,"Ángel Zárraga was a well-known Mexican painter and poet and became one of the great figures of Mexican culture in the first half of the 20th century. He came from a well-off family and studied in Mexico City at the National School of Fine Arts along with the famous painters Diego Rivera and Saturnino Herrán. Zárraga got in contact with intellectuals and artists of the Mexican Youth Athenaeum movement and the art magazine Revista Moderna. In 1904, his family financed a trip for him to Italy, France and Spain, where he had successful exhibitions. Two years later, he studied briefly in Bruxelles. After a return to Mexico Zárraga went to Italy in 1909 and then settled in France, where he lived for over 30 years. Here, he adopted influences of Cubism and Impressionism but also of the Renaissance, particularly Paul Cézanne and Giotto di Bondone. Zárraga’s murals, especially in churches, brought him international fame as a muralist and decorator of large spaces. As a member of the Mexican diplomatic corps, he served for several years as a cultural attaché at the Mexican Embassy. When he exhibited in New York during the Great Depression and the collapse of the international art market, Zárraga lost sponsors and friends. He became depressed, preferring mystical and religious subjects. To escape from World War II, he returned to his home country and created murals, notably in the Monterrey cathedral. As a poet, he left poems and aesthetic notes reflecting his artistic activities. He died of pneumonia, leaving unfinished his murals planned for the Biblioteca México. In the 1928 catalog, all 16 works he submitted are classified as paintings, probably all oil paintings. Two are reproduced in the catalog and can therefore be clearly identified as having been submitted: a Scene de rugby (also Partie de football, 1925, oil on canvas, 100 x 80 cm) and Footballeur negre (actually Le Jeune footballeur, 1927, oil on canvas, 92 × 72 cm). The latter is supposed to show the Brazilian international Fausto dos Santos (1905-1939). According to a description in a contemporary newspaper, this painting could also correspond to Le Ballon. An illustration of Tres futbolistas (aka Tres futbolistas con boina, 1921, oil on canvas, 214 x 124,5 cm) is included in the 1932 catalog. The painting is, like some of his other works on soccer, a motif in a series of stamps of Mexico issued 1986. More paintings can be clearly identified. With his paintings of black and female footballers Zárraga was a pioneer. In France, women’s soccer had a short heyday after the end of World War I. This topic is represented by the paintings La futbolista rubia (1926, oil on canvas, 145 x 90 cm) and La futbolista Morena (1926, oil on canvas). The following paintings could also be traced: Remate de cabeza (aka Heading, 1926, oil on cardboard, 41 x 33 cm), Futbolistas en el Llano (probably exhibited as Le but dégagé, 1924-28, oil on canvas, 175 x 122 cm), El futbolista (probably exhibited as Portrait d’un Footballeur, (1924-28, Oil on canvas, 175 x 122 cm), Retrato de un jugador de rugby (probably exhibited as Footballeur nègre (rugby), 1925, oil on canvas, 91 x 65 cm), and Départ (Rugby) (1921, oil on canvas, 60 x 74 cm). A drawing titled Une touche is obviously a preliminary study for Heading. There may also, however, be other oil paintings with this title. Further information is unfortunately lacking on some of the paintings that are recognizable in photos from the exhibition in Amsterdam, including the large-format work Athlètes.",

However, the team, which contained the great Toni Kukoč, surprisingly lost the European Champions Cup final to Limoges.

Tall and handsome, with long, almost silver hair, he was very popular in Italy and engendered several nicknames – The Lion King (Il Re Leone), Super Mario, and Cipo. He turned professional in 1989 and raced to April 2005, although he returned briefly in 2008. He was the fastest sprinter in the peloton throughout his career, and one of the fastest ever. His sprinting prowess brought him multiple stage wins in multi-day events but his difficulty in the mountains often caused him to abandon before the finish. His major single-day victories were the 2002 World Championship road race and Milano-Sanremo, and he won Gent-Wevelgem three times, in 1992-93 and 2002. At the grand tours, Cipollini won multiple stages, and his 42 stage wins at the Giro d’Italia is a record. He won his 42nd stage in 2003 to break the record of Alfredo Binda, commenting afterwards, “I would just have been happy to polish his [Binda’s] shoes.” He also won the points classification three times at the Giro. Cipo won 12 stages at the Tour de France and three at the Vuelta à España. At the 1999 Tour he won four consecutive stages. Known for wearing unusual outfits, after the fourth consecutive win he wore an all-Roman outfit, as did his entire Saeco team. He also wore all-yellow once while leading the Tour, and appeared at times in tiger skin, zebra prints, and muscle suits, and was fined frequently for not wearing the team kit.",Brother of Cesare Cipollini Listed in Olympians Who Received the Italian Olympic Association (CONI) Gold Medal () Listed in Olympians Who Were Sent to Prison (In 2022 he was sentenced to three years in prison for domestic abuse.)

Two years later he made a small piece of history by winning a bronze medal in downhill at the 1974 World Championships at St. Moritz as this was the first medal won by a Liechtensteiner at world or Olympic level. He was equally capable at all three disciplines then contested and won an Olympic bronze in slalom in 1976 and a second World Championship medal, this time at giant slalom in 1978. He also awarded a silver medal for his combined performance at slalom and downhill at the 1976 Olympics although, since the combined event was not an Olympic event, this was considered a World Championship medal only. Oddly for a multiple championship medallist he only registered a single podium finish, a third place, in five seasons of World Cup competition. After retirement from skiing he took a degree in business management and later worked as a financial planner for the Liechtenstein National Bank. Frommelt also moved into politics with the centre-right Fortschrittliche Bürgerpartei in Liechtenstein and served a term as a municipal councillor.

45885,Elaine Tanner,Female,22 February 1951,160.0,61, Canada,CAN,"Elaine Tanner was arguably Canada’s biggest swimming phenomenon of the late-1960s, beginning with her breakout performance at the 1966 British Empire and Commonwealth Games. She had been swimming since the age of six, and broken two American records earlier in the year at the United States Championships, but no one expected what would happen at the Games. She left the tournament with seven medals, gold in the 110 and 220 yard butterfly, the 440 yard individual medley, and the 4x110 yard freestyle relay, and silver in the 110 and 220 yard backstroke and the 4x100 yard medley relay, and world records in the 220 yard butterfly and the 440 yard individual medley. She was not only the first woman to win four gold medals at a single Commonwealth Games, but also became the youngest winner of the Lou Marsh Trophy as Canada’s top athlete at 15 (she also won the Bobbie Rosenfeld Award as Canada’s best female athlete). Her next stop was the 1967 Pan American Games, where she took gold in the 100 and 200 m backstroke events in world record times and silver in the 100 m butterfly and the 4x100 m freestyle and medley relays. She was then selected to represent Canada at the 1968 Summer Olympics, where she won silver in the 100 and 200 m backstroke events and bronze in the 4x100 m freestyle relay (alongside Marilyn Corson, Angela Coughlan, and Marion Lay). Despite becoming the first Canadian female to earn an Olympic swimming medal, and capturing three of the nation’s five medals at the Games, she received negative press upon her return for having succumbed to the pressure and missed out on gold. The reaction was so disappointing that Tanner retired from active competition, but her accomplishments were eventually recognized. She was made an Officer of the Order of Canada in 1970, had the award for Canada’s top junior female athlete named after her in 1972, and was inducted into Canada’s Sports (1971) and the International Swimming (1980) Halls of Fame. After struggling for many years with depression, she earned a degree in kinesiology from Simon Fraser University in 1986 and eventually took up a career in holistic health and, as of 2013, practices in Oakville, Ontario.","Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the Summer Pan American Games (2–3–0 1967 Winnipeg SWI gold: 100 m backstroke and 200 m backstroke, silver: 100 m butterfly, 4×100 m freestyle relay, and 4×100 m medley relay) Listed in Olympians Who Set a World Record in Long Course Swimming (100 m backstroke – 27 July 1967 - 30 January 1968: 1:07.3 (27 July 1967; Winnipeg, CAN), 1:07.1 (30 July 1967; Winnipeg, CAN); 200 m backstroke – 26 July 1967 - 6 January 1968: 2:24.4 (26 July 1967; Winnipeg, CAN)) Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the British Empire/Commonwealth Games (4–3–0 1966 Kingston SWI gold: 110 yards butterfly, 220 yards butterfly, 440 yards medley, and 4×110 yards freestyle, silver: 110 yards backstroke, 220 yards backstroke, and 4×110 yards medley)"

He also painted cityscapes, landscapes, flowers, interiors, seascapes, still lifes, and mythological and biblical scenes. One critic even called him “an all-round athlete” among painters. He joined the group “Pulchri Studio”, which also included Kees van Dongen. Following his marriage in 1930, Goedhart and his wife Jenny moved to Germany. There, Goedhart turned to painting landscapes and, maritime pictures, his first love. Following the conclusion of World War II, the couple returned to the Netherlands, where he fully turned his attention to seascapes.

63870,Rolly Tasker,Male,21 March 1926,180.0,79, Australia,AUS,"A sailor since the age of six, Australian Rolly Tasker gained an interest in the sport when his parents introduced him to model ships as a young boy. He built his first racing dinghy, including the sails, at the age of ten and began a journey that would encompass, throughout the course of his life, over 7000 competitive races. Following service in World War II, where he saw action at the infamous Battle of Ambon, he founded a sail-making business and began exporting his products in 1949. His fame in the sporting realm grew rapidly as he captured Australian national titles in the 12 Square meter Sharpie class every year from 1952 through 1956, the year in which he also won an Olympic silver medal alongside John Scott in the Two Person Heavyweight Dinghy, Mixed event at the Melbourne Summer Games. In 1957 it was announced that the Flying Dutchman class would replace the 12 Square meter Sharpie event at the 1960 Summer Olympics and Tasker wasted no time earning his reputation in these vessels as well, winning the Australian National Championships in 1957, 1958, 1960, and 1962 as well as the World Championship in 1958. At the 1960 Summer Games, however, he finished 18th out of 31 teams. After becoming the World B Class Catamaran champion in 1966 he switched to ocean racing and, from 1969 through 1985, rose to unprecedented fame in the Western Australian ocean racing scene through his countless victories and the numerous records he shattered while achieving them. Among his most notable appearances was the 1978 Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race where, after being disqualified on a technicality, he sailed the race anyways with a five minute head start and completed the course 20 hours ahead of the official winner. He was also a participant in the notorious 1979 Fastnet race, where fifteen people died during disastrous weather and only 86 of the 303 starters finished. Nearing 70 and now a member of the Western Australian Hall of Champions, having been inducted in 1986, Tasker was far from finished with his career. In 1994 he moved to Thailand and set up a new sail-making factory in Phuket, quickly turning it into a multi-million dollar business. He was made a member of the Sport Australia Hall of Fame in 1996 and the Order of Australia in 2006; in 2008 he opened the Australian Sailing Museum, the same year his biography “Sailing to the Moon” came out, the title referencing the fact that he had sailed farther than the distance of the moon over the course of his career. Having suffered from skin cancer since the age of 40, the result of decades spent under the sun at sea, he battled the disease for over half his life until he died of its effects in June 2012 at the age of 86.",

920995,Koshiro Onchi,Male,2 July 1891,,, Japan,JPN,"Japanese Koshiro Onchi’s father was a lawyer and calligrapher, and he himself studied the Chinese classics, spent long hours over his calligraphy, and learned the art of Noh theater, all traditional scholarly activities. He enrolled in the Tokyo School of Fine Arts in 1910, and began to study oil painting and sculpture, but he dropped out after only four months. Although Onchi was staunchly Japanese, he rebelled against many traditional Japanese art forms. He started as a book illustrator, but is first and foremost regarded as a forerunner of expressionist painting and the first Japanese to devote himself to abstract art. Parallels are often drawn between Onchi and Russian painter Vasily Kandinsky. Before the war Onchi began to do Sosaku Hanga prints – as one of its founders – with his own emphasis on abstraction, and tried to keep the slowly developing Sosaku Hanga movement alive during World War II, maintaining its ideals through the war and piloting it through the early part of the Occupation. He used his social standing, wealth, and connections to obtain materials and supported many young artists in the movement during this difficult time. Onchi saw how the war had created hardship not only for painters and print makers, but also for other creative artists such as poets and musicians. While he had already experimented with abstraction, these hardships of war and their effect on Japanese reality became an important subject for him during the war years, and drove him to explore abstraction even further. In the art catalog of the 1932 Games, his surname was erroneously transcribed as Onji. His submitted work could not be identified. One of Onchi’s best-known prints, however, titled Daibingu (Diving), dates from 1932, and has a clear reference to sports.",

95515,Per Ivar Moe,Male,11 November 1944,,, Norway,NOR,"Per Ivar Moe was the wonderboy of Norwegian speed skating during the “skating revolution” in 1963. Born in Lillehammer, he later moved to Oslo. He was selected for the national team in April 1962, and started training according to the training principles introduced by the new national team coach, Stein Johnson. At 18 he won a bronze medal in his first international championship, the 1963 European Championships. The next year he lost an Olympic gold medal in the 5,000 m by a mere 0.2 seconds. Moe had been in the lead most of the competition, but Knut Johannesen closed in at the end of the duel. When Johannesen crossed the finishing line, the scoreboard showed 7:38.7, one tenth behind Moe. Johannesen closed his eyes in resignation, and for a split second Moe thought he was Olympic champion. When Johannesen opened his eyes, the time had been corrected: 7:38.4, and Moe had lost the gold. In 1965, at the age of 20, Moe became World Champion, and the first Norwegian speed skater to win that title at Bislett.

Following the introduction of All-In wrestling in 1930, Angus decided to make some money from the sport and, after losing his amateur status in February 1931, decided to gamble on becoming a full-time professional. His amateur career had seen him win the British featherweight title in 1928, when he also travelled to the Amsterdam Olympics, where he lost his featherweight quarter-final bout to the Canadian Danny McDonald. Angus represented Great Britain again at the 1929 European Championships in Paris and, in 1930, representing England, he won a lightweight silver medal at the British Empire Games in Hamilton, Canada, losing to another Canadian, Howie Thomas. After turning professional, while the country was facing an economic downturn, Angus was fortunate because the popularity of professional wrestling was on the up. Angus was a popular member of the Northern circuit before being asked to fight all around Britain. He fought, and beat, many big names of the day, at some of the country’s top venues, and in 1938 he was regarded as the British and European welterweight champion, as well as the European claimant to the World title. A few days after his final appearance in the ring, Angus was accidentally shot in the arm while shooting rabbits near his home at Branton, Doncaster, on Saturday 26 October 1940. He was rushed to Doncaster Infirmary where he died four days later, at just 35 years-of-age.

She competed at two Olympic Games, at Paris 1924 and Amsterdam 1928 with her best result coming in her first appearance in which she finished sixth in the women’s springboard event. The highlight of her career, however, was her first-place finish at the European Championships held at Bologna in 1927 in the three-metre springboard event. Winning two more consecutive national championships in 1928 and 1929, Bornett was seemingly at the height of her career when she was later forced to retire by 1930 due to an illness which saw her begin to lose her visual faculties and eventually go blind. In 1921, she married Albert Bornett. At the beginning of World War II in the late 1930s, she and her husband and a brother attempted to escape to Belgium when, according to her family, she apparently became ill and died during the evacuation.

Therefore, they were able to defeat the favored bobs from West Germany, Switzerland and Austria. Nehmer and Germeshausen share the record for the most gold medals won by bobsledders (through 2018). Nehmer also won an Olympic bronze medal in the two-man in 1980 with Bogdan Musiol.

After graduating with a bachelor’s in physical education in 1965, he pursued amateur wrestling and, after rising to prominence at the provincial level, entered the trials for Canada’s delegation to the 1966 British Empire and Commonwealth Games. Although he did not make the team, two years later he was in Mexico City, representing Canada at the 1968 Summer Olympic Games in the welterweight division. In the first round of the freestyle category Heffel defeated Wesley O’Brien of Australia by a fall and was one of only two competitors to participate in the opening round and leave without any negative points. He faced the other, Yury Shakhmuradov of the Soviet Union, in the second round and was defeated, suffering 3.5 negative points. A fall against Tömöriin Artag of Mongolia, the eventual bronze medalist, eliminated him from the event. He was less successful in Greco-Roman, as he was disqualified in his bout against Romania’s Ion Ţăranu and then eliminated after a fall against Bulgaria’s Metodi Zarev. Following the Olympics Heffel re-entered the University of Alberta to acquire a master’s degree and, in the process, won 68 and drew 2 of the 70 wrestling matches he entered. He continued wrestling through 1970, when injuries forced him to retire from active competition. Nonetheless, he remained involved in sports as an administrator, high school PE teacher, wrestling referee, and successful rugby coach that brought his high school team, as well as the junior division of his former club, the Edmonton Druids, to championship success. In 1999 he was added to the University of Alberta’s Sports Wall of Fame.",

On 7 August 1900, Lawrence (then a sergeant) and a private Hayman were attacked and outnumbered by a group of Boers. Hayman’s horse was shot from under him and he was trapped under the horse with a badly dislocated shoulder. Lawrence bravely lifted Hayman onto his own horse and they sped to safety. Lawrence received his VC personally from King Edward VII in London on 12 August 1902. Upon his return to England after the Boer War, Lawrence transferred to the 18th Hussars and was made their riding master with an honorary commission as a captain. He gave distinguished service in World War I, despite being injured in 1914. He also saw service in the early part of the 1939-45 hostilities. Lawrence retired from the Army having attained the rank of lieutenant-colonel. Being a distinguished horseman, Lawrence was one of three officers in the British Army team that finished third in the 1910 King’s Cup jumping competition at the International Horse Show at Olympia, behind Belgium and France. He went to the 1912 Stockholm Olympics, competing in both the team and individual three-day event events.",

In early 1901, he enlisted with the British Army and served with the South African Constabulary during the Boer War. At the end of the conflict, Hefferon remained in South Africa and worked as a prison guard in Bloemfontein. He was the South African 4 miles champion from 1904-08, but at the South African Olympic trial marathon in 1908, Hefferon did not perform very well, dropping out after 11 miles. The members of the South African Amateur Athletic Union had so much confidence in Hefferon that they decided to send him to the London Olympics instead of Ken McArthur, who won the trials. At London, Hefferon at first finished fourth in the 5 mile event and then won silver in the marathon. Hefferon led the field during most of the marathon, but a draught of champagne just two miles from home caused him stomach cramps and he was overtaken by Dorando Pietri, who was later disqualified and Johnny Hayes. After the 1908 Olympics, Hefferon returned to South Africa and won national titles at 4 miles and 10 miles in 1909, but then turned professional and moved to England. As a professional, Hefferon won the English 4 miles and 10 miles championships in 1910, but then moved back to Canada in 1912 and settled on a farm near Simcoe, Ontario. During World War I, he enlisted again and served with the Royal Canadian Dragoons. After the war, Hefferon was acting chief of police in Dunnville before transferring to the Ontario Provincial Police. He worked on special assignments in Hamilton and then moved to motorcycle patrol with the Department of Highways in Brantford, Blenheim and starting in 1930 in Brampton. On 12 May 1932, Hefferon was on duty and when trying to proceed through an intersection in Derry West on Brampton Highway, sounded his siren but was hit by a motorist who later claimed he did not see the officer approaching. Hefferon died at Peel Memorial hospital in Brampton the next morning without regaining consciousness. The motorist was charged with dangerous driving and released on $2,000.00 bail.

69191,David Jenkins,Male,25 May 1952,190.0,82, Great Britain,GBR,"Already a multiple Scottish champion at 100 m, 200 m and 400 m, David Jenkins was still just nineteen when he made his name by winning an unexpected victory at the 1971 European Championships. Running in an outside lane he blasted off maniacally and then just held off the threat of Italy’s Marcello Fiasconaro. He narrowly missed the Olympic final in Munich but had the consolation of a silver medal behind Kenya in the relay. Jenkins added another European gold in 1974 in the relay though he failed to defend his individual title and he left the 1974 Commonwealth without a medal of any colour. His best time was recorded in 1975 when he scored a rare British success at the US National Championship and in doing so became the first Briton to break 45 seconds for the event. A contender for Olympic honours in Montreal he did reach the final but faded to seventh in the home stretch whilst his hopes of another relay medal were ended with a dropped baton in the heats. More often injured than healthy in the four years before Moscow he did at least win a Commonwealth Games gold medal with the Scottish sprint relay team in 1978 but it was a surprise when he returned to form in time for the 1980 Olympics. He participated in his second Olympic final where again he placed seventh, but only made fleeting appearances over the next two seasons and elected to retire at the end of 1982. He returned to public attention and notoriety five years later. Jenkins, who had lived in California for many years, was revealed as one of the masterminds behind a smuggling operation that at one time was reported as being responsible for 70% of the steroids trafficked into the USA. The scheme involved the setting up of a production facility in Mexico. He also disclosed that he himself had used steroids for the latter part of his career. Sentenced to seven years in prison he served just nine months and after his release set up a dietary supplement company with another convicted drug felon Dan Duchaine . Duchaine, the self-styled “Steroid Guru” was an outspoken proponent of the use of drugs in sport and was credited with popularising the use of such illegal substances as GHB (4-Hydroxybutanoic acid) and Clenbuterol in American sport. After Duchaine’s death Jenkins became CEO of the company and is reportedly a multi-millionaire.

Her international breakthrough came in 1974, when she won the bronze medal at 1,500 m at the European Championships, and she was a semi-finalist at the distance at the 1976 Olympics. By then she had finished her education as a teacher and married her club coach Jack Waitz. In the 1978 European Championships she won another bronze medal, this time in the new event, 3,000 m. In 1975 she had broken the world record at the distance with 8:46.6 in a solo effort in Oslo. The year 1978 marked the start of her astonishing career as a marathon runner. She was invited to run the New York Marathon by race director Fred Lebow, and after some reluctance she decided to go for it. To everybody’s surprise, she won the race, bettering the unofficial women’s best time by over 2 minutes. She won the New York Marathon nine times between 1978 and 1988, bettering the world’s best time on three more occasions. She also won London Marathon twice, in 1983 and 1986, on the last occasion with her career best of 2-24:54. In 1983 she became the first marathon World Champion at the inaugural championship in Helsinki, and followed this with her silver medal in the first women’s Olympic marathon in 1984 at Los Angeles. Waitz also won the International Cross-Country Championship five times (1978-81, 1983), a record she shares with Doris Brown. For her remarkable career in athletics Waitz was appointed a Knight 1st Class of the Royal Norwegian Order of St. Olav, which she received from King Harald V of Norway in November 2008.

His musical teacher, influencer and friend was the Italian composer Gian Francesco Malipiero (1882-1973). Both were among the first to use polytonality as a new musical language. He became better known even internationally participating in the First Venice Music Biennale, where he won the First Prize with his Concerto for Orchestra. In 1925, he was appointed professor of harmony, counterpoint, and fugue for music and music history at the former High School (now Academy) “Benedetto Marcello” in Venice. The influence of the fascist government on culture led to a change in his style and his production diminished until 1953 while focusing on chamber music. He later became director of the Trieste Conservatory in 1955 and from 1960-71 was director of the Venice Conservatory. In his later years, he wrote several works for the stage but also chamber and religious music, isolating himself increasingly from the new avant-garde. A foundation has been established to rediscover his literary and musical legacy as a composer, conductor and teacher. At the 1936 Olympics, Bianchi received an Honorable Mention for his Due improvvisi, entered in the category instrumental and chamber music. In 1948, he was awarded a bronze medal in the vocals section for his Inno Olimpionico for choir and orchestra written in 1947.",

In Paris, he worked as an architect from 1935-51. He was best known for his reconstructions of the town of Lorient after World War II. Faced with a city that was reduced to a heap of ruins, Tourry first proposed to rebuild the city on another site but the inhabitants opposed this project. After several revisions, the restoration project of the old city, accompanied by new districts, was finally approved. In the 1960s, Tourry was appointed chief architect of the civil buildings and national palaces, led various hospital projects, built universities and designed major housing projects. He was a lecturer at the Polytechnic from 1946 to 1960 and Professor at the National School of Bridges and Roads. He was a member of the Société des architectes diplômés du gouvernement (S.A.D.G.) since in 1939, and was appointed Knight of the Legion of Honour. His contribution for the 1948 art competitions was also part of his initial plans for the reconstruction of the city of Lorient. Although today’s Stade du Moustoir was built at the envisaged location, it was inaugurated only in 1959 with a capacity of only 6,000 seats. After the promotion of the local football team, the stadium was largely rebuilt in 1998.",

He took up rowing at the Canottieri Pontedera and at the age of 14 won the Italian Youth Games. He wore the vest of the Canottieri Firenze between 1990-92, then returned to his home club and made his début at the World Championships with a bronze in the lightweight eights in 1993. A world title came in coxless pairs with Carlo Gaddi in 1994, then another in coxless fours with Gaddi, Andrea Re and Ivano Zasio the following year. In Atlanta, with Pettinari struggling with an inflamed Achilles tendon, the Italian world champions failed to even reach the final. Pettinari then switched to the double sculls. He won two World Championship silver medals (1997, 1998) and a gold medal (1999) when he was paired with Michelangelo Crispi. The partnership was broken up in the Olympic year and instead he was paired with Elia Luini, on the intuition of the Italian technical director Giuseppe La Mura. The new pair finished behind the Polish pair at the Sydney Games but then dominated the event with three consecutive world titles from 2001-03. The pair travelled to Athens having recently proved their merit by winning the Lucerne Regatta. Their Games were ruined when Pettinari suffered a stress fracture of the ribs and they could only place fifth in their semi-final, and Pettinari had to be replaced for the B final. He won a final world title in the lightweight fours in 2007 and ended with a total of 10 world championship medals.

At the local girls’ grammar school Kwaśniewska played volleyball, basketball, and handball before she began to focus on athletics. In 1930, when Kwaśniewska was 17-years-old, she became the Polish national champion in the long jump. As a specialist in the javelin throw Kwaśniewska represented Poland seven times between 1930 and 1946. Kwaśniewska set nine Polish records in the javelin and was a 14-time national champion in multiple events including the long jump and javelin. Kwaśniewska also represented Poland in volleyball and basketball. At the 1936 Berlin Olympics Kwaśniewska won the bronze medal in the javelin competition with a throw of 41.80. After the event was concluded all three medallists had their photo taken with Adolf Hitler. In 1937 Kwaśniewska lived in Warszawa and took an active role in the resistance movement. The apartment where she lived became an open house for Poles and Jews who were homeless and starving. When World War II began Kwaśniewska was living in Genova, Italy, but she returned to Warszawa on hearing news of the German invasion of Poland. On reaching the Polish capital Kwaśniewska worked as an ambulance driver, as she had previously become a paramedic, and helped to transport wounded soldiers to hospitals. In August 1944 the Nazis began to establish Dulag 121, a transit camp for the people of Warszawa who had been driven out of their homes. Kwaśniewska went to the camp with the photo of her and Hitler from the 1936 Berlin Olympics. As a result the camp guards did not question Kwaśniewska, who appeared to know the Führer personally. Kwaśniewska was then able to escort multiple prisoners from the camp, saving them from either forced labour or the concentration camps. After the War was over Kwaśniewska made a brief return to sport, becoming the Polish champion one more time in the javelin and representing Poland in basketball. In her final sporting appearance Kwaśniewska finished sixth in the javelin throw and seventh in the shot put at the 1946 European Championships. From 1947 to 1979 Kwaśniewska sat on the board of the Polish Athletic Association. In Poland she co-founded the Klub Olimpijczyka (Olympians club) and was a member of the Polski Komitet Olimpijski.

In 1983 he received a scholarship to the University of Oregon and won the NCAA 800 metre title that same year, adding a bronze medal at the 1983 World Championships. In 1984, Cruz won a rare 800 m/1,500 m double at the NCAA Championships and went to the 1984 Olympics as a favorite in the 800 m, along with world record holder Seb Coe of Great Britain. In the 800 metre final, Cruz crossed the line in 1:43.00, breaking Alberto Juantorena’s Olympic record and making him the first Brazilian Olympic track and field gold medalist since triple jumper Adhemar Ferreira da Silva, who won gold in 1952 and 1956. After the Olympics, on a European tour, Cruz had one of the great stretches in 800 metre running. At the Weltklasse meet in Zurich he won in 1:42.34, becoming only the second runner in history to break 1:43, and setting a Brazilian record. Two days later he ran 1:42.41 at the Van Damme Memorial in Brussels, and then two days after that, at a meeting in Köln (Cologne), Cruz ran the second fastest 800 meters in history, his time of 1:41.77 only four hundredths of a second short of Coe’s world record. By the end of 1984, Cruz was NCAA champion, Olympic champion, undefeated in all seven of his 800 metre finals, had run the 2nd, 4th, 5th, and 6th fastest 800 metre times in history, and easily ranked #1 in the world for 800 meters in 1984 by Track & Field News. In 1985 Cruz continued to impress, winning six of his eight 800 metre races, the last three of which were won under 1:43, and again ranked #1 in the world for the year. Injuries later hindered his training and he never again reached the peaks of 1984-85.

68623,Diane Charles,Female,7 January 1933,178.0,62, Great Britain,GBR,"Until the age of 19, pioneering British women’s athlete Diana Leather had set her mind on being a hockey player. That was until she was fascinated by the track and field events at the 1952 Helsinki Olympics, after which she decided to join her local athletics club, Birchfield Harriers. Her coach pushed her into longer distances, which, for women in those days, were 880 yards and cross-country. Within a year of taking up the sport, she ran a world best 5:02.6 for the mile at White City, knocking over seven seconds off the previous record. On 26 May 1954, Leather fell just short of becoming the first woman under five minutes for the mile, when she ran 5:00.2. Three days later, however, at the Midlands Women’s Championship at Birmingham, and barely an hour after setting a new British 800 metre record, she became the world’s first woman under that magical five minutes for the mile, when she clocked 4:59.6. While Roger Bannister’s sub-four minute mile 23 days earlier received media coverage that ran for days and weeks, and turned him into an overnight celebrity, Leather’s achievement merited just a single paragraph in The Times. She received the same amount of column inches as Chris Chataway, who set an unofficial word best mark for the 11/2 miles at Motspur Park the same day. Women’s athletics was so far behind the men in those days, and it would not be until 1967 that the IAAF recognised women’s world records for the mile and 1500 metres. At the Olympics the longest individual event open to women, until 1960, was the 200 metres, but when they re-introduced the 800 in Rome, Leather competed in her one and only Olympics. With her best days behind her, she was unfortunately eliminated in her first heat. Sadly she never got to run her favourite distance, the mile (or 1500 metres), in a major international competition. Despite her Olympic failure, Leather (later Charles) won silver medals in the 800 at the 1954 and 1958 European Championship, earned five AAA titles (880 yards in 1954-55, 1957 and mile in 1956-57), and was also the British cross-country champion four years in succession 1953-56. She lowered the world best mark for the mile four more times, and her final “record” of 4:45.0 stood for seven years. She also set three world records in the 880 yards. A former microanalyst at Birmingham University, Charles quit athletics after the Roma Olympics to concentrate on her careers as a teacher and social worker, before moving to live and retire in Cornwall.

Brodtkorb went to Kristiania (Oslo) to study in 1911, and become a member of Kristiania Idrætsforening, specializing in standing jumps with immediate success. In the Olympic trials in June 1912, he won both standing jumps with new personal bests, 1.435 and 3.10. In Stockholm he did not qualify for the final in standing high jump, and placed 12th place in standing long jump. He ended his short athletic carreer by becoming Norwegian champion in standing long jump in September 1912, definitively the shortest career for a Norwegian athletics Olympian. After finishing his studies, Brodtkorb married and moved to Notodden to work for Norsk Hydro. While in Notodden, the family’s two children – both daughters – were born in 1919 and 1920.

With his older, and more successful, brother Frank, the pair regularly took part in challenge matches with the famous Wyld brothers from Derby, three of whom, Lew, Harry and Percy, were in the 1928 Olympic pursuit team with Monty. The Southall-Wyld challenges were big crowd pullers in the late 1920s.

Shortly after the Games he fled Nigeria, due to what journalists described as either religious or political oppression, and arrived in Halifax, Nova Scotia in 1993. He gained his citizenship in 1996 and won both the Olympic trials and the Canadian heavyweight title that year, assuring him a place on the nation’s delegation to that year’s Summer Olympics. After a bye in the opening round, he defeated Ahmed Rajab Omari of Kenya and then prevailed in the quarter-finals when his opponent, Christophe Mendy of France, was disqualified for a below-the-belt hit that left Defiagbon unable to continue the fight. Two days later he was sufficiently recovered to defeat Nate Jones of the United States and advance to the final, where he was soundly defeated by Cuba’s Félix Savón, the defending champion who would go on to claim the crown a third time at the 2000 Games. After earning his silver medal, Defiagbon turned professional and won his first 21 bouts, remaining undefeated until 2004, when he fell to Oleg Maskaev, future world heavyweight champion. A second loss in 2005, against former world cruiserweight champion Juan Carlos Gómez of Cuba, led to his retirement from active competition.

He went on to win more than 30 titles including Yorkshire, Northern Counties, and British titles. He made his international début for England against France in 1931, and that same year won the first of his four British featherweight titles. Taylor won six consecutive Northern Counties featherweight titles between 1929-34 and in 1932 and 1933 successfully defended his British crown, but lost the final to fellow Yorkshireman Norman Morrell in 1934. A septic toe kept Taylor out of the 1935 Nationals but he returned in 1936 in the hope of regaining his title. The Championships also doubled up as an Olympic trial but the event turned into a farce. With around 70 competitors there was only one mat in use, and with the competition nowhere near a close at 11 pm, Taylor and some other Northern wrestlers had to leave the competition in order to catch the midnight train home and forfeit the chance of a title and possible place at the Berlin Olympics. Shortly after that, Taylor quit the sport but was tempted out of retirement to fight for England against Japan in London later in the year. He then followed that with national title number four in 1937. Taylor competed at the 1932 Los Angeles Olympics and survived three rounds before just missing out on a medal position when eliminated in round four. He missed selection for the 1934 British Empire Games when he was reserve to Lancashire’s Joe Nelson in the featherweight division. Taylor later founded his own club, the Olympic Sports Club in Bradford, where he acted as secretary and instructor.

She then became an art teacher, and during the German occupation encouraged their students to capture their own expressions of the experiences and injustices of the war in their images. Jouclard painted in a lively and pleasing style – her documentary style paintings of dance halls and sporting events are probably the best of her oeuvre. Therefore, she was considered the “Queen of the Movement”. Further inspiration came from her home region Lorraine and from trips to North Africa. She spent most of her life in Versailles and in the valley of the Rupt de Mad, a tributary of the Moselle. Later, she was appointed Knight of the Legion of Honor. In 1972, after 14 days in a coma, she died at the age of 89 from injuries she suffered in a car accident in Versailles. Her own museum has been set up in her birthplace Onville. Numerous other works are in the French Sports Museum. As Boxers were one of her favorite motifs, it is unknown which of her numerous paintings and drawings was submitted. Rowing, on the other hand, is a rare motif. It is therefore very likely that it was the painting L’Aviron à Joinville (oil on canvas, 38 x 46 cm). Hockey is also a recurring motif, often in the form of sketches and studies. The picture Match de hockey sur glace, Jeux Olympiques, Los Angeles, 1932 - more correctly Lake Placid - was obviously created in this year. In 1948 Adrienne Jouclard participated again with the painting Rugby à Jean Bouin, a stadium which is still in use today after major renovations.",Listed in Olympians Who Died in Motor Vehicle Accidents (Boat/Car/Motorcycle/Train) (Died from the injuries she suffered from a car accident in Versailles after 14 days in coma.

Brought up in the Basque region of San Sebastian, he thought about joining the priesthood when he was 11 or 12, but soon dispelled the idea because he enjoyed playing sport too much. He played beach football, and later basketball with the Atlético San Sebastián club. He was hoping to go to the European School Games (FISEC) with the local basketball team, but was invited to have a try at the triple jump for the newly formed athletics section of the club, and the first time he jumped, he broke the junior record of his region, and went to the Games as one the track and field squad instead of basketball, and came home with a gold medal. Shortly after the Games, when still only 16, he was invited to move to Madrid to continue his education, and train for the 1960 Roma Olympics. In 1959, when he was 17, and the day after he broke the Spanish long jump record, Areta applied to join the Spanish religious organisation Opus Dei as a Numerary. However, he also continued his athletic career, and with great success. Areta made 57 international appearances for his country, a then record for a male Basque athlete. He won five Spanish Junior titles 1960-62, before going on to win 13 senior jumping titles between 1959-71.

She was one of six children and her two younger siblings, Elsie and Percy, both became competitive tennis players but without having the same level of success as Violet. Percy and Violet played in the mixed doubles together at Wimbledon in 1914 and 1922. Violet started playing competitively in the early 1890s but gave up for a while before returning to the sport in 1902, and a year later she made the first of her 10 appearances at Wimbledon. Her best performance in the singles was in reaching the quarter-finals on three occasions – in 1906 when she lost to Charlotte Sterry, in 1908 when she was beaten by Dora Boothby and in 1920 when, at the age of 49, she had to scratch from her match with Elizabeth Ryan. She fared slightly better in the women’s doubles, reaching the semi-final in 1914 with the French girl Marguerite Broquedis but they were beaten by Edith Hannam and Ethel Larcombe 6-2, 6-0. In the period before World War I, Violet competed in the covered court singles at the 1908 Olympics. She received a bye in the first round but was eliminated 7-5, 7-5 by Gladys Eastlake-Smith, the eventual champion. Violet did win many titles prior to the War including the London Grass Court Championship in 1907 and 1908 when she beat probably the best female player in Britain at the time, Dorothea Lambert Chambers. Violet also won the 1903 German Championship (her brother Percy reached the men’s semi-finals that same year), and on home soil won the Welsh indoor title, and championships at Shropshire, Bournemouth, Lamington, Cinque Ports and Romsey. In 1930, aged 59, she reached the last eight of the women’s doubles at the Hampshire championship at Bournemouth.",

At the 1994 Olympics, he seemed to be headed for the gold, but was pipped at the line by Chae Ji-Hun. But Vuillermin would still return home from the Games with a gold, which he won in the relay along with Maurizio Carnino, Orazio Fagone and Hugo Herrnhof. Vuillermin would go on to collect the relay world title in 1996 (adding to four silver and three bronze medals won at the Worlds), having already won the 1993 World Team Championships (with 4 additional medals won between 1992 and 1997). His other successes came at the then newly established European Championships in 1997, where he won the 500 m and 1,500 m, and placed 3rd overall. Sadly, his career ended on 20 June 1997. Just weeks after his team mate Orazio Fagone lost a leg in a motorcycle accident, Vuillermin nearly suffered the same fate. He crashed his motorcycle into a truck, suffering severe injuries.

In 1919 he joined the Artists Union in Wien. In World War I, he served as a war volunteer and war painter. Later, he spent most of his summers in his native town of Tachov (in German Tachau). As a staunch Nazi, he took over leading functions in art and culture after the Austrian Anschluss. In 1936 he was appointed professor and in 1957 received the State Prize, the Golden Laurel of the Vienna Künstlerhaus. In 1939, an article was published in the Nazi-newspaper “Völkischer Beobachter” titled “Painter of the Ostmark. Rudolf Böttger”, in which the works submitted for the Olympic Games were mentioned: “The result is a large painting created for the last Olympic Games: The Javelin Throwers, and the Sports Portfolio, in which the many artistic opportunities offered by sport in its various forms of expression have found a captivating form.” At the Berlin Games, the painter met the Hamburg based entrepreneur August Brinkmann, who bought the oil painting The Javelin Throwers. The Sports Portfolio consisted of 16 lithographs in the format 50 x 36 cm. In 1944 his apartment and studio in Wien (Vienna) were destroyed. After World War II he first lived in Deggendorf, then later in Regensburg (both FRG).

Lezak went to college at UC Santa Barbara, graduating in 1998. He made the 2000 Olympic team where he won his first Olympic gold, in the medley relay. His only individual Olympic medal was a bronze in the 2008 100 metre freestyle. He won golds in the 2004 and 2008 medley relays, and silvers in the 4x100 freestyle in 2000 and 2012, along with a bronze in that event in 2004, in addition to the aforementioned 2008 gold medal. His eight Olympic medals ranked him =8th all-time among American men (as of 2022). In 2008, the United States was not favored in the 4x100 freestyle relay, that honor going to the French team, led by the 100 metre freestyle gold medalist, Alain Bernard. Lezak was the US anchor, and when he took off, Bernard had already been staked to a 0.59 second lead by his teammates, a margin that seemed insurmountable, but Lezak chipped away at the lead, beating Bernard by 0.67 on the anchor leg, and bringing the USA an unexpected gold medal. The win also preserved Michael Phelps’ perfect Olympic effort of eight gold medals in eight events. At the World Championships Lezak won six medals with four golds, all in relays between 2003 and 2011. At the Short-Course Worlds he won seven medals with five gold medals, again all in relays, between 2002-06. He added eight medals and five golds at the Pan Pacific Championships from 1999-2010. Lezak passed up the opportunity to compete at the 2009 World Championships to swim at the Maccabiah Games, where he was given the honor of lighting the Maccabiah torch at the Opening Ceremony.

At the Games, however, he competed in only one event, the 800 metres, and was eliminated in the semi-finals. He was also a reserve with the 4x400 metres relay team that won the bronze medal, but he did not compete. His next stop was the 1930 British Empire Games, where he was eliminated in the heats of the 880 yards. After receiving a scholarship to the University of Notre Dame, he earned a bachelor’s degree in physical education and set his sights on helping coach Canadians in the leadup to the 1940 Tokyo Olympics. Unfortunately for Little, the war intervened, but he received a different opportunity in 1948 when he was invited to Ceylon (now Sri Lanka) by the Ceylon Amateur Athletics Association to coach their national delegation. Duncan White’s silver medal in the 400 metre hurdles led to Little’s appointment as the University of Ceylon’s first Director of Physical Education. He used the position to develop the institution’s sport infrastructure and help it compete in inter-university and international tournaments. In particular, he developed the facilities at what would become the University of Peradeniya, formerly a campus of the University of Ceylon. In retirement, he moved back to Canada.

His most notable victory was over the visiting South African champion, P. Hunter, at Gloucester. Goulding was coached by the Oxford blue, J. King, and finished second to his mentor at the first Midland Championships in 1895. Later in the year he made his only appearance at the AAAs when he finished last in his heat of the 120y hurdles and was one of only two of the 10 competitors who failed to achieve the standard time of 17.0. According to Tom Curtis (USA), who won the 1896 Olympic hurdles, Goulding was the most confident athlete he had ever met. His confidence proved to be misplaced as he lost narrowly to Curtis in the final, but in fairness it should be said that Goulding was running on cinders for the first time and experienced considerable difficulty in adapting to the unfamiliar conditions. Also, while practicing in Athens, he fell heavily, damaging a knee, and was unable to train for a few days.

She created a stylistically homogeneous but unmistakable oeuvre in marble, clay, plaster, and bronze. Carpentier became famous for a beautifully written artist’s diary (1930-65), illustrated with hundreds of drawings, which was a valuable source of information about her pictorial research, the genesis of her work, her thoughts, her readings, her buyers and the vicissitudes of her life.

In 1940 he moved to BBTE for two seasons and then in 1945 returned to BKE for one season. Between 1946 and 1949 he was part of the Ferencváros team. He left the country in 1948 and played with the Austrian side EC Kitzbühel. The following year, however, he moved to Australia, where he continued to play for a short time for the Melbourne Pirates and then the Blackhawks team and later played a significant role in promoting ice hockey Down Under. As the center of the Hungarian national team of the 1930s, Miklós won the World University Championship three times, skating for the triumphant Hungarian team in 1933, 1935, and 1937. Between 1931 and 1939, he competed at the World Championships seven times, as well as in the 1936 Garmisch Winter Olympics, where he led Hungary in scoring with eight goals. He scored once against Germany, five times against Belgium, and twice in the 3-0 victory over France. After completing his career in 1950, Miklós became the coach of the Melbourne Blackhawks. In 1953-54, he served as president of the VIHA (Victorian Ice Hockey Association), during one of the most tumultuous stages in local hockey history, when the amateur status of “new Australians” was sharply criticized. In 1952 together with the Czech-born Parisian restaurant owner Andre Schwatz, Miklós was a co-founder of Continental Carry Food, a take-out food company with home-made European food. Later, with a law degree, he worked for a Melbourne law firm, where he became involved in an embezzlement case for which he was suspended and sentenced to three years in prison. He died in 1981 in Melbourne. The Miklós Trophy was founded in his honor in 1990, which is given each year to the best technical player at the Hungarian Hockey Championship. He was posthumously inducted into the Hungarian Hockey Hall of Fame.",Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the European Ice Hockey Championships (0–0–1 1934 Milano bronze)

He was a solid distance runner but his life after athletics was far more interesting. Zamperini enlisted in the United States Army Air Corps in 1941, and was deployed to Hawaii as a bombardier. On 27 May 1943, his aircraft went down due to mechanical problems. Only Zamperini, the pilot, Russ Philips, and Mac McNamara survived. At home, all crew members were presumed dead, and Zamperini’s obituary appeared in US newspapers. However, Zamperini and his two crewmen managed to get out of the wreck of their B-24 and climbed into lifeboats. After 47 days, eating sharks and albatrosses, they were rescued by a Japanese fisherman near the Marshall Islands. By that time, McNamara had died. They were arrested when brought to shore, and were moved from island to island, eventually landing in a prisoner-of-war camp in Japan in September 1943. For two years, Zamperini barely survived the reign of terror of Matsuhiro “The Bird” Watanabe, one of the most notorious Japanese guards during World War II. When released in 1945, he met a New York Times reporter. Telling him his name, the reporter failed to believe Zamperini, as he had read about his death. Zamperini managed to convince him with a university card, one of the few possessions he had after two years of imprisonment. The remarkable story made headlines at home, where he received a hero’s welcome. After the war, Zamperini began a new career as a Christian motivational speaker. One of his favorite themes is “forgiveness”, and he has spoken several times in Japan to former war criminals, several of whom had tortured him as a prisoner-of-war. Zamperini was given the honour of carrying the Olympic Flame three times, in 1984, 1996 and 1998. At the latter occasion, the Nagano Winter Olympics, he returned to Japan for the first time since 1950, when he had gone there on a Christian mission. Shortly before the Nagano Olympics, it was discovered that Watanabe was still alive as well, but a meeting with him was blocked by the Watanabe family. Zamperini wrote (with David Rensin) a book about his life and experiences, entitled Devil at My Heels. In 2010, well-known author Laura Hillebrand wrote his biography, Unbroken, in far more detail. A movie based on the Hillebrand book, screenplay by the Coen Brothers and directed by Angelina Jolie, came out in late 2014.

At the age of 17, he walked the 21 miles (34 km) from his Shropshire home to Halesowen, in the hope of finding work, which he did. His first victory as a competitive walker was in 1904, when he won the Halesowen to Kidderminster, and back, race. Price was later one of the men responsible for founding the Halesowen Athletic Club in 1922, and also discovered and coached the 1924 Olympian Eddie Webster. Price was a member of the winning England team at the International Cross-country Championships in both 1906 and 1909, with a best individual finish of sixth in the first of those years. It was in the Marathon at the 1908 Olympics that Price nearly carved his name into Olympic history. He qualified for the race as the winner of the Midland Olympic Marathon Trial and, at the Games, led for more than half the race, before pulling out after 14 miles, giving in to the heat and fast pace. Shortly after winning his second International Cross-country title, Price turned professional, and in 1910 won the coveted Powderhall Marathon on his début. That same year, he set a world professional record for 15 miles. Price’s athletic career effectively came to an end with the outbreak of World War I. He served with the Royal Garrison Artillery (1915-19) and saw action in France and Flanders. While awaiting demobilisation, he represented his unit in the 1919 Polytechnic Marathon, which was to be his last race over the distance. He finished sixth.

Lie often depicted the sea, channels, and ships with dramatic perspective. He became known for colorful impressionistic scenes of harbors and coves, painted during the many summers he spent on the coasts of New England and Canada.

He played in an era before goalie masks and, by the end of his playing days, he had collected a total of 118 stitches to his face and skull.

After this, he studied fine art painting and figure painting in Paris at the Académie Colarossi and La Grande Chaumiere. In Paris, he met many people who influenced him. One of his Parisian neighbors was the sculptor Antoine Bourdelle (1861-1929). Returning to London in the mid-1920s, O’Sullivan found work in book design and printmaking. Moving back to Dublin, he focused on portrait art, completing a number of paintings in oils as well as crayon and pencil. Fluent in Irish and French, gregarious and a renowned story-teller, Sean O’Sullivan also painted a number of murals, executed chalk drawings, designed postage stamps, and taught at the Dublin Metropolitan School of Art. Most of his works were portraits, interspersed with landscape painting of the West of Ireland. During his distinguished career as portraitist, O’Sullivan drew or painted portraits of many of the leading political and cultural figures in Ireland. His entry for the 1932 art contests was a portrait, Cyclone Warren, Negro Boxer. Joseph “Billy” Warren, called “Cyclone” (1877-1951), was an American (or Australian) boxer. Unfortunately, most of his fights are barely documented. Towards the end of his career, he settled in Dublin, where he was well known as an original character for several decades.

In February 1927 he became the Canadian lightweight champion by defeating Cliff Graham, a fellow-Olympian who had won a silver medal for Canada in the bantamweight division of the 1920 Games. Newton lost the title just two months later, however, after being defeated by the reigning national featherweight champion Leo “Kid” Roy. In his next bout he was held to a draw with Eddie Paulhus, and then took a five month hiatus before returning to the ring and defeating Joey Novak of the United States.

He was then trained as a conductor in Wien (Vienna) and went to Paris until 1939 for further studies. During World War II he gave legal and illegal concerts in occupied Warszawa, sometimes together with his friend and fellow composer Witold Lutosławski (1913-94). After the war Panufnik became conductor of the Krakow Philharmonic Orchestra and then director of the Warsaw Philharmonic Orchestra. In 1953 he led an official Polish cultural delegation to China, where he met Mao Tse-tung. The 1st prize in the pre-Olympic composition competition for the Uwertura Bohaterska (Heroic Overture) was one of many awards he received for his compositions in the 1950s. Because of the restrictions imposed by the political guidelines for artists in post-war Poland, he left the country in 1954 and emigrated to Great Britain. Therefore, he was subsequently silenced in Poland. In England Panufnik worked as musical director of the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra. From 1963 he concentrated on composing and was awarded the Prix de Composition Musicale Prince Pierre de Monaco and the Sibelius Medal. After the lifting of censorship restrictions in Poland in 1977, many of his works were performed there for the first time. In the 1980s Panufnik was appointed an honorary member of the Royal Academy of Music in London and of the Association of Polish Composers. In 1990 he returned to Poland for the first time. The following year he was knighted in Great Britain and eventually posthumously awarded the Polonia Restituta Medal. The first performance of his Heroic Overture took place on May 16th, 1952 at the Warsaw Philharmonic Hall. A trip to Helsinki during the Olympic Games, where he conducted a performance of his work, was his only trip abroad during that period. The first sketches were from the time of the German invasion in 1936, which he expanded into a 6-minute dynamic orchestral overture in 1951.",

37282,Jack Dearlove,Male,5 June 1911,,, Great Britain,GBR,"Following an accident in Acton on 2 May 1923, Jack Dearlove’s life changed forever. On that day, Dearlove, and a fellow schoolmate, William Metcalf, the son of a local barrister, were riding on a bicycle together when they fell and were run over by a passing lorry. The two boys each had a leg amputated but, sadly, Metcalf eventually died from his injuries. Dearlove survived, but had to endure the now-unacceptable prejudices that went with being disabled in those days. Before he lost his leg, Dearlove was a member of the cricket first XI at Lynton House school, Holland Park, London, and a team photo shows Dearlove sitting on the front row of the photograph. This was before his accident. When he appeared on the next picture, he had been relegated to scorer, and had to stand at the back of the photograph, and behind a bush, so nobody could see his disability. More than 20 years later, Dearlove was to be the subject of a similar prejudice at the 1948 Olympics. As cox to the British rowing eight, he was scheduled to take part of the parade of athletes at the Opening Ceremony but the “powers to be” thought it would be wrong for the rest of the world to see a British athlete parading on crutches, and Dearlove had to watch the event from the stand. That humiliation did not deter him, and he guided the British eight to the silver medal, as he became one of the few “disabled” athletes to win a medal at a regular Olympics. Dearlove took to rowing because he felt he was on equal terms to his rivals and he went on to enjoy a successful career as a cox, winning many prestigious races with the Thames RC eight at Regattas on the River Thames. The one he sought most was the Grand Challenge Cup at Henley and, having twice lost to Leander in 1929 and 1932, he eventually achieved his ambition when the Thames eight gained revenge over their old rivals by winning the title in 1948, to make it a memorable year for Dearlove. In 1950 he won a bronze medal at the Empire Games, representing England. Dearlove enjoyed a successful career in the planning department of Sainsbury’s, and played his part in the introduction of the company into the supermarket business in the United Kingdom. He died in a car crash in 1967 that may have been caused as a result of him having a heart attack. Dearlove’s youngest son was Sir Richard Dearlove, former head of MI6 and later at Master at Pembroke College, Cambridge, while his daughter Ann was the headmistress at the famous Roedean girl’s school. The Official Report on the Opening Ceremony of the 1948 Olympics said: “Thus were launched the Olympic Games of London, under the most happy auspices.” Maybe Jack Dearlove, sitting in the stand would not have agreed? Had his situation existed when the Games were next held in London in 2012, then Dearlove would probably have been seen heading the procession of British athletes at the Opening Ceremony, and not watching from the stand. It is with a certain irony that at the very moment Jack Dearlove was sitting in the stand watching the Olympic Opening Ceremony on 29 July 1948, Ludwig Guttmann was organizing the first Games for people with disabilities at Stoke Mandeville Hospital, when 16 wheelchair bound people took part in an archery competition, in what would be the forerunner of the Paralympics.","Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the British Empire/Commonwealth Games (0–0–1 1950 Auckland ROW bronze: eights (competed for England)) Listed in Olympians With a Disability (Right leg amputee.)

In 1928, she transferred to Władysław Jarocki at the Academy of Fine Arts in Kraków and in the following year to Felicjan Kowarski at the Warsaw Academy of Fine Arts. Both Jarocki and Kowarski had previously participated in the Olympic Art Competitions. After graduation, Łada joined the group of artists “Pryzmat” (“Prism”). In 1936, she married painter Juliusz Studnicki and went with him to Paris. After their return to Poland, they both taught drawing in Wiśniowiec (now Vyshnivets, UKR). During the occupation in World War II, she worked in an artists’ café in Kraków. After the war, Łada was a co-founder of the State College of Fine Arts in Sopot (since 1996 Academy of Fine Arts in Gdansk), where she later headed the studio of painting. In 1954, she was awarded the Golden Cross of Merit and was appointed professor one year later. From 1969, she also taught at the Faculty of Painting of the Academy of Fine Arts in Warsaw. She moved there in 1970 and remained until her retirement in 1978. Łada participated in numerous exhibitions in Poland and abroad. In addition to paintings and drawings, she also created murals. Thus, she was involved in painting the polychrome facades of reconstructed tenement houses in Gdansk, as well as in the Old Town of Warsaw. She painted her pictures in the spirit of colorism, especially landscapes, figurative scenes in the landscape and portraits. Her landscapes, however, were always created in the studio. Later Łada turned to abstraction. The painting Regatta, jointly produced by Krystyna Łada and Juliusz Studnicki, received an award in the Polish pre-Olympic competition. Painted in oil on canvas, the 89.8 x 127.5 cm size painting is in the collection of the National Museum in Warsaw.",

He was switched to the eight with a view to taking a seat in that boat for the Sydney Olympics but an injury to Tim Foster meant that he was drafted into the coxless fours for the latter half of the1999 season. The crew, which also included Olympic legends Steven Redgrave and Matthew Pinsent, won the world title in a race Redgrave described as “the easiest win of my career”. Foster returned to action for Olympic year and Coode joined Greg Searle in the pair but their Olympic hopes were cruelly dashed when, after leading for most of the Sydney final, they were outsprinted and finished in fourth place. Coode won a second world title as part of the revamped British four in 2001 but injury forced him to take a prolonged absence from the sport and he lost his place in the boat. He won a bronze at the 2003 Worlds as part of the eight and it was in that boat he was scheduled to compete at the Athens Olympics. Six weeks before the 2004 Olympic Games were due to begin Coode again got the call to replace an injured rower and became part of the crew that successful defended the Olympic coxless fours title.

Prior to the 1994 Winter Olympics he was selected as the gold medal favorite in the 500m event by Sports Illustrated, but ended up placing eleventh after a fall in the semi-finals. In the 1,000m competition he led for a long time, but was knocked down by Nicky Gooch with three laps left in the final. Gooch was disqualified, so all Campbell needed to do was finish the race to earn bronze. Upon the completion of the event, however, it was discovered that the lap counter had failed to display the correct number of laps remaining, and thus Campbell had actually skated one lap too few. To make matters even worse, his 5,000m relay team failed to reach the podium by only one spot, placing fourth. Undeterred, Campbell continued training hard and placed third overall at that year’s World Championships. At the 1997 World Championships he won gold in the 500m event and was third overall again. The following year he won gold medals in the 5,000m relay events at the 1998 Winter Olympics and World Championships, as well as an additional gold in the team competition. His career began its dénouement at this point and he retired in 2000. He was inducted into the Cambridge, Ontario Sports Hall of Fame in 1998 and served as a representative to the International Skating Union as a skater from that year through 2000. After his retirement he began a successful career as a skating coach and was team leader and coach for the U.S. National Team in 2006. He received the Petro-Canada Coaching Excellence Award in 2007 and 2008 and was the 2007 Québec Coach of the Year.

But it was as an oarsman that ‘Lurch’, as he was called by his team-mates, first gained notoriety in 1975 when he was a member of the National eight that beat Harvard by two lengths to win the Grand Challenge Cup at Henley, before narrowly missing out on a medal in the coxed fours at that year’s World Championships at Nottingham, when they were beaten to the bronze medal by the West Germans by just over one second. At the Montreal Olympics the following year Ayling was in the coxless fours that qualified second from their heat, but were then last in their semi-final, and last again in the B final. Richard worked in the family business making hand-crafted wooden blades, before moving into making boats which saw some of the sport’s great like Andy Holmes, Matthew Pinsent, James Cracknell and Sir Steven Redgrave all win Olympic gold in an Ayling shell. But his association with the sport did not end there. In 1978, after studying the techniques of the top German rowers, he took up coaching at the Kingston Rowing Club, where he had been a member since 1970, and went on to develop many future international rowers, and in 1981 he sent three Kingston teams to the Munich World Championships and in the coxed fours, which contained Andy Holmes, they pushed the strong East Germans until the closing stages of the race before falling away and finishing fifth. However, they went on to win at Henley that same year. Ayling continued coaching internationally until 1986, and at club level until shortly before his untimely death at the age of 64. He was also the editor of Rowing and his wife Astrid was a West German international rower who went on to represent Great Britain at the 1980 and 1984 Olympics, and like her husband was a Royal Henley winner, a rare achievement for a married couple.",Husband of Astrid Ayling

He created paintings, frescoes, tapestries, illustrations, posters, and interiors of ships. With the knowledge of a naval officer, he became known primarily as a painter of the seas. Although Știubei was influenced by Impressionism, his pictures were mostly realistic. He created monumental artworks for numerous public buildings and designed stamps for the Romanian Post Office. In 1969, he was the first Romanian artist to receive the Vermeil Medal of the “Arte-Science-Lettres” Society for his designs. In 1937, he had already been appointed Knight of the Legion of Honor. In 1975, he emigrated to Germany, and as a result, he was not allowed to exhibit in his homeland for 15 years and was largely forgotten. His gouache Olympic Dinghy competition, presented in 1952, could be the design for the stamp Concurs cu ambarcatiuni (Boat race), published in 1948 and designed by Știubei.

A superb competitor in major meets, he did not set his first world record until 1962, when he became the first man to throw beyond 200 feet with 200-5½ (61.10). He posted three more world records, but it was competition, not records, that motivated Al Oerter. He won the AAU title six times (1957, 1959-60, 1962, 1964, 1966), was NCAA champion in 1957, sharing that title in 1958, and won the Pan American Games in 1959. Oerter was favored only going into his 1960 Olympic victory, and he was never the world record holder going into the meet, nor did he ever win the U.S. Olympic Trials, but such was his competitive greatness that at three of the four meets he responded with the longest throw of his career to win the gold. He walked out of the record books into legend at Tokyo in 1964 when he threw with torn rib muscles and a pinched cervical nerve that required a neck brace. On his fifth throw, he almost had to be carried from the field because of the pain, but that throw gave him the gold medal. In 1979, he said of that meet and that throw, “I think of that day now, 15 years later, and I still hurt.” Oerter retired at the end of the 1969 season, but he made a comeback in 1977 and the following year set a personal best of 221-4 (67.46). Incredibly, in 1980 he placed fourth at the Olympic Trials, having earlier in the season, at the age of 43, raised his career best to 227-11 (69.47). Oerter was a systems analyst and computer engineer for an electronics firm on Long Island, and after graduation from the University of Kansas, he competed for the New York AC.

In 1945 Takada survived the explosion of the atom bomb less than one kilometre from the epicenter in his office at the China Electric Power Company, but he lost one of his daughters.

67601,Volmari Iso-Hollo,Male,5 January 1907,176.0,64, Finland,FIN,"As a youth, Volmari Iso-Hollo did skiing, gymnastics and boxing, taking up running only after he joined the Army. He was successful in a wide range of events, running all distances between 400 metres and the marathon. Iso-Hollo won his first international races in 1928, when he won both the 3,000 and 5,000 m at the 1928 Workers’ Olympiad. He won his first Olympic gold medal in the steeplechase at the 1932 Summer Olympics. He was denied a chance at the world record because the officials lost count of the number of laps, as the official lap-counter was looking the other way, watching the decathlon pole vault. When Iso-Hollo went to his last lap, the official failed to ring the bell, and the entire field kept on running and so the finishing distance was 3,460 m. If the distance were 3,000 m, Iso-Hollo would likely have broken the world record. He also won silver in the 10K in Los Angeles. In 1933, Iso-Hollo did break the 3,000 metre steeplechase world record, running 9:09.4 in Lahti and went to the 1936 Summer Olympics as the favorite. At Berlin, Iso-Hollo won the steeplechase by three seconds, finishing in the world record time of 9:03.8. Iso-Hollo added a bronze in the 10K to complete a set of Olympic medals. Iso-Hollo also won six Finnish titles – in 5,000 metres in 1933, the steeplechase in 1936, in cross-country in 1932 and 1936 and in team cross-country in 1930 and 1933. After the 1936 Olympics, Iso-Hollo fell ill with rheumatism, but competed until 1945. Iso-Hollo’s date of birth has frequently been seen as 1 May 1907 (including by us, previously), but that is an error of the two date systems. In May 2017, this was pointed out by Vesa Tikander of the Finnish Sports Museum, who wrote, “This is confirmed by the inscription on Iso-Hollo’s gravestone: https://billiongraves.com/grave/Volmari-Iso-Hollo/16701460#/, his birth certificate, press stories of his 50th and 60th birthdays and a biography written by his daughter. The late Markku Siukonen, Finnish Olympic historian, also always maintained the January 5 birthdate in his authoritative works on Finnish Olympic history.

Rasmussen studied at the Technological Institute before going to Oslo in 1910 to work as a portrait photographer.

Rasmussen’s first exhibits took place in 1919, with his work being shown in Toronto, London, and Stockholm. Later exhibitions took place in cities in the United States including New York, Washington, Buffalo, and Chicago. In 1922 Rasmussen became a Norwegian citizen, but he returned home in 1935 to run his father’s business in Havdrup. By the late 1970s several collections of Rasmussen’s photographs had been acquired by various organisations, including a set of 300 pictures by the North Jutland Art Museum.

He raced for local cycling clubs Godiva Harriers and Premier Cycling Club, and in 1907 he was one of the founder members of the new Coventry Racing Cyclists Club. But it was after joining the Arab Cycling Club in 1911 that he gained recognition and subsequent selection for the England team, one of three Great Britain teams entered for the road race at the Stockholm Olympics. Sadly, due to the poor condition of some areas of the circuit, Arthur suffered a bad fall, breaking his collar bone and he had to withdraw. consequently he failed to contribute to his team’s total in the team element of the race although they did go on to win the silver medal. The state of the roads in Stockholm were so bad, and unsurfaced in parts, that nearly a quarter of the 123 starters failed to complete the race.",

He took up polo in 1933 and joined the juniors of the local Venado Tuerto team, which also contained his brother Edmundo and cousin Juan. They won a local tournament and then took part in the national championship. When he was just 21, Roberto was a surprise selection at #2 for the Argentine national side at the 1936 Olympics where he proved his critics wrong by scoring five goals in the 15-5 win over Mexico and a further four in the 11-0 win over Great Britain in the final match to make him the top Argentine scorer. In the same year Cavanagh was also a member of the first Argentinian side to win the Cup of the Americas and in the first match at Meadow Brook, Cavanagh scored nine goals in Argentina’s 21-9 win. After his 1936 performances his handicap was raised to eight, the second highest in the country at the time. He had a spell playing in the United States and, also in 1937, won the Monty Waterbury Cup playing for Templeton. After leaving the family ranch, Cavanagh went to work at the Hurlingham Club and in 1937 was a member of their team that won the Argentine open. He later returned to his original team, Venado Tuerto, and went on to win six more Argentina opens with them, in 1944, 1946-48, 1950 and 1955. Cavanagh eventually became a 10-handicap player and in 1949 he won the World Championship and also the US Open with Hurricanes. When Cavanagh played on the winning Cup of the Americas team at Buenos Aires the following year he became only the second man after America’s Winston Guest, in 1928 and 1932, to play on two winning teams. In 1951 Cavanagh rounded off a memorable career when he played on the Argentina side that beat Mexico 10-5 to win the first and only Pan-American Games polo title. Cavanagh stayed involved with the sport after his retirement and was the coach of the very last Argentine Cup of the Americas team in 1980 when Argentina beat the USA at San Antonio Texas. One of his older brothers, Santiago, was a 6-handicap player and a reserve for the Berlin Olympic squad.

From his European idols he learned that marathon runners needed not only endurance, but also speed, which he gained running middle and long distances on the track. He was the first Japanese person to apply this strategy. In 1928 he proceeded to Keio University and qualified for the Amsterdam Olympics in the national marathon trials, finishing second to Kanematsu Yamada. Unhappy with his sixth place, Tsuda concentrated on the next Olympics. On the road to Los Angeles, he won multiple Japanese championships (1,500 in 1929, 1,500 and 5,000 in 1930, and 5 and 10K in 1931) while pursuing his philosophy of speed training. In 1928 and 1931 he was also a member of his university’s relay team in the Hakone Ekiden. Together with two runners from occupied Korea, he represented Japan in the 1932 Olympic marathon. After failing to medal for the second time he retired from competitive running. In the 1980s, a press release reported that not only was he shocked that he could not run against Paavo Nurmi, due to Nurmi’s violation of the amateur rules, but Tsuda had also missed his grape juice at a feed station past the halfway point of the Olympic race. After graduation Tsuda joined Joban Life, a major insurance company. He continued to be involved in athletics, however, and was appointed marathon coach for the Berlin Olympics. Allegedly due to illness he resigned one week before the departure to Europe. Rumors spread. however, that he was rejected by some of the runners. During the war, he worked for an organization under the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, but after the war he returned to sport and founded Sports Nippon, the first Japanese daily sports newspaper. In athletics, he served as leader of the Japanese team for the Boston Marathon in the 1950s. Personal Best: Mar – 2-33:26 (1932).",

He was mainly known for still lifes, landscapes, figures, and florals. Trunk was active among a large group of New York modernists experimenting in abstraction between the Wars. Like many artists from this group, Trunk was a recognized and visible artist in New York during the 1920s and 1930s, but his legacy as a contributor to the development of American modernism has been lost in more permanent reconstructions of the history of American art. During the 1920s and 1930s, Trunk’s work was consistently on display at galleries throughout New York, positively reviewed by well-known art critics, and included in high profile exhibitions such as the Whitney Museum of American Art and the Venice Biennials. During the 1960s he was considered one of the pioneers of Pop Art.",

In 1960 the duo attended their first World Championships, but placed 11th. They rebounded in 1962, however, capturing the Canadian senior title and improving their placing to 4th at the World Championships. They were Canadian champions again in 1963, and added a North American title to their resumes as well. In 1964 they took another Canadian title and won bronze medals at the World Championships and the Winter Olympic Games. Before the year was at its end, Wilkes had retired at the age of only 17. Her figure skating saga, however, had only just begun as a few weeks later it was discovered that the silver medal winners from Germany, Marika Kilius and Hans-Jürgen Bäumler, had signed professional contracts before the Olympics and had therefore not been eligible to participate. Wilkes and Revell were then awarded silver, but Kilius and Bäumler were never officially removed as silver medalists by the ISU and, in 1987, had their medals returned by the German National Olympic Committee. In total, therefore, four silver medals were awarded for the event. Outside of the controversy, Wilkes has spent her working life involved with figure skating as a broadcaster for CTV, an author and a coach. She obtained an undergraduate degree in psychology from York University, followed by a graduate one in communications from the University of Michigan in the 1970s. She led the CTV team that uncovered rigged judging at the 1999 World Championships. Since 2006, she has served as the director of sponsorship and marketing for Skate Canada.

8722,Joe Lydon,Male,2 February 1878,,, United States,USA,"Joe Lydon is distinguished among American Olympians as having won Olympic medals in two truly disparate sports. Lydon was probably the outstanding athlete at the CBC school in 1904 and when an Olympic soccer tournament was scheduled, school officials approached him about organizing a soccer team, which he did. But in addition, Lydon boxed in the Olympics, losing in the welterweight semi-finals to Harry Spanjer. Besides boxing and soccer, Lydon was an outstanding track star. He was primarily a sprinter, with a best time of 49.0 in the 440 yds. – heady stuff for 1904. Lydon began his business career as a whiskey salesman before prohibition hit the country. He also served as superintendent of St. Louis streets from 1901 until 1909. From 1918 until his death, Joe Lydon ran his own company, the Joseph P. Lydon Oil Company. However, a hobby took up much of his time. He raised beagles and was a charter member of the St. Louis AKC Beagle Club.",

85665,Andreas Felder,Male,6 March 1962,183.0,70, Austria,AUT,"Tyrolian-born Andreas Felder first competed in the ski jumping World Cup at the age of 18 in January 1980 during the Four Hills Tournament in Innsbruck. At the World Junior Ski Championships he took bronze in the same year. It was one year later when he scored his first World Cup points, placing 13th in January 1981 in Bischofshofen, again during the Four Hills Tournament, and about one month later he celebrated his first podium finish with second place in ski-flying at Ironwood, Michigan (USA). But he had to wait 3½ years for his first World Cup victory which occurred in December 1984 on the normal hill in Thunder Bay, Ontario. He also won the next three World Cup events within eight days. At that time Felder had already won a silver medal with the Austrian team (with Hans Wallner, Hubert Neuper, and Armin Kogler) at the 1982 World Championships held in Oslo. In the 1984-85 World Cup Felder finished second to Matti Nykänen and won two silver medals at the 1985 Nordic World Ski Championships held on home soil in Seefeld (Tyrol), once again with the Austrian team (with Armin Kogler, Günther Stranner, and Ernst Vettori) and one in the individual jumping on the normal hill held on the Toni-Seelos-Olympiaschanze. The following years Felder finished third twice in the World Cup (1985-86 and 1986-87), became world champion at the 1986 Ski-Flying World Championships held in the Austrian Bad Mitterndorf, where he also equaled the standing world record at that time with a 191-metre flight on his last jump, and won gold on the large hill as well as bronze with the Austrian team (with Ernst Vettori and the non-Olympians Richard Schallert and Franz Neuländtner) at the 1987 Nordic World Ski Championships in Oberstdorf. In March 1987 Felder won the Holmenkollen ski jumping, but the technique of his sport changed during the end of the 1980s. The classical or parallel style (Däscher technique) which was used in former years was no longer competitive and Felder had to learn the new V-technique. After three years without a World Cup win Felder won again in March 1990 at Örnsköldsvik (SWE) and again placed third in the World Cup (1989-90). The following season (1990-91) he won the World Cup, achieved his best overall result at the Four Hills Tournament with a second place, and won a team gold (with Ernst Vettori, Heinz Kuttin, and Stefan Horngacher) at the 1991 Nordic World Ski Championships in Val di Fiemme. He again placed third in his last World Cup season (1991-92) and won a team silver at his third Winter Olympics. Shortly after the Games Felder retired, but not without winning his last ever World Cup competition on the large hill in Planica. In total he won 25 World Cup events – a mark which was only topped by Matti Nykänen (46 wins) at that time. After his career Felder worked as coach. Among others he was head coach of the Austrian ski jumping team (1995-97), head coach of the German Nordic combined team (1997-2000), and ski jumping coach of the Austrian Nordic combined team, before coaching Austrian youth ski jumpers. Felder was Austrian sportsman of the year in 1987.","Listed in Olympians Who Were on the Podium at the Four Hills Tournament (1984/85 Oberstdorf third; 1986/87 Oberstdorf third; 1990/91 Total second, Oberstdorf second, Garmisch-Partenkirchen winner, Bischofshofen winner; 1991/92 Garmisch-Partenkirchen winner, Innsbruck third) Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the World Nordic Ski Championships (2–3–1 1982 Oslo SJP silver: team; 1985 Seefeld SJP silver: normal hill and team; 1987 Oberstdorf SJP gold: large hill, bronze: team; 1991 Val di Fiemme SJP gold: team) Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the World Ski Flying Championships (1–0–0 1986 Kulm gold: individual)"

Two hours later, her fiancé (now husband) Alan Budikusuma won the men’s singles title. This talented couple arrived home to Indonesia following the Olympic Games elevated in popularity beyond their already rock-star status and were both rewarded financially by the government for bringing so much pride and joy to their country. Four years later, Bang got revenge on Susanti at the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta, as she had spent time watching video of Susanti’s play and used the knowledge to beat the Indonesian 11-9, 11-8 and reach the gold medal finals in women’s play, sending Susanti home with the bronze medal. So admired was Susanti in Indonesia, the Olympic and World champion hoped that the birth of her first child in 1999 would bring peace to her country, which had been rocked by a series of civil outbreaks and violence. She offered her first child born in 1999 as the “Child of Peace” for this populous nation, and so named her Laurencia Averina Wiratama, which means “peace”.

As a youth, Litvinov competed in wrestling and played football before taking up athletics and hammer throwing in high school. Litvinov won the Olympic gold in 1988 and silver in 1980 and probably missed a third Olympic medal in 1984, when the Soviets boycotted the 1984 Olympics.

He was Soviet Champion in 1979 and 1983 and set three world records– 81.66 (1980), 83.98 (1982) and 84.14 (1983). Litvinov initially retired from sports after the 1988 Olympics, but made a short comeback in 1993 to compete at the 1993 World Championships. Before the championships, Litvinov threw 82.16 to win the Russian title and was considered as one of the favorites, but at the championships finished in a disappointing seventh place. Litvinov later worked as a hammer throwing coach, first in Russia and later in Germany. His son Sergey Litvinov, Jr. became an international level hammer thrower.

Although he finished only third at the 1936 AAU Championships, Williams won the U.S. Olympic Trials at 400 metres in 46.6.

He started with football, but at age 14 moved to athletics, as a shot putter, and later played handball. He became a butcher and when he worked at the slaughterhouse, one of his companions invited him to Kinizsi Húsos, so he finally found his sport – wrestling. His first success was when he finished third at the junior championship and in 1962 he was invited to be a coaching partner on the national team. Because he did not want to diet, he wrestled in the higher weight group, where István Kozma, later a two-time Olympics champion, was his main training partner and Csatári learned from him. In 1963, Csatári débuted with the adult national team, but he did not qualify for the 1964 Tokyo Olympics. He then moved to Bp. Honvéd, where he was coached by Károly Kárpáti, the Berlin Olympic champion. In 1968 Csatári competed at the Olympics and won a freestyle bronze medal at 97 kg. Four years later in München, he won a bronze medal in freestyle and also finished fourth in Greco-Roman, but in the 100 kg class. He was one of the last wrestlers to be successful in both styles. Altogether Csatári won two World Championship silver medals, and nationally won 19 individual and 21 team championships. He retired in 1975. In addition to sports, he graduated from the catering technical school, so he first became the head of the Honvéd Clubhouse, and then returned to the slaughterhouse, from where he retired in 1985 due to deteriorating health.

Her best international finishes were a bronze at the 1998 Goodwill Games and placing fifth in the 2002 International Cross-Country Championships in the short-course event, the best ever for a US woman. Favor-Hamilton competed in three Olympics and was looking for a medal at Sydney in 2000, coming into the Games with the best time of the year. Her brother had recently committed suicide and a friend was ill with cancer and she was hoping to win the medal to honor them. During the 1,500 final she led the second and third laps and for the early part of the final lap, but she was then passed by several runners, and then fell. Favor-Hamilton later admitted that she fell on purpose, feeling that she had let down her family and friends. She feigned injury initially but later admitted to the ruse. Favor-Hamilton continued to compete, looking towards the 2004 Games and a fourth Olympic appearance, but began to suffer from depression and considered suicide. She retired from competitive running shortly before the Athens Olympics. She then began a career as a realtor and doing motivational speaking, while raising a young girl. She had always been known as a very attractive woman and also did frequent commercial endorsement work.

His greatest year was 1926 when he set four world records – 500 metres in 1:03.6, 800 metres/880 yards in 1:50.9/1:51.6y, and 1,500 metres in 3:51.0 – and in that year, he defeated, among others, running superstars Paavo Nurmi, Edvin Wide, and Douglas Lowe. In 1927 he added a world record in the 1,000 metres, running 2:25.8 on Colombes, France, and in 1932 he set a European record for the indoor kilometer in 2:30.8. He won multiple German individual championships, as follows: 400 m – 1926, 800 m – 1923-25, 1931-32, 1934; 1,500 m – 1922-25; and 400 hurdles – 1926-27. He was also German school champion at 1,500 metres in 1921-22 and over 400 metres in 1924. Peltzer joined the Nazi Party in 1933 and was a member of the SS, although they had a particular hatred for him, and in 1934, he was suspended due to homosexual activity under German law §175. A year later the Berlin Court sentenced him to 1½ years in prison due to a violation of German law §176, when he was accused of indecent acts with persons under 14-years-old. Peltzer fled to Sweden in 1939, but returned in 1941 and was interned in the Mauthausen Concentration Camp, where he managed to survive the rock-breaking work. After the war he again fled Germany, as homosexuality remained a criminal offense in 1950s Germany, and Peltzer was in conflict with the German Athletic Association (DLV) and Carl Diem, and his opportunities to coach were limited. He briefly stayed in England and China, and then obtained a commission from a German newspaper to report on the Melbourne Olympics, and after the Games tried unsuccessfully to get work with various national athletics organizations before settling in India, where he became known for his involvement in local athletics development. He coached in the national athletics stadium in New Delhi, and founded the Olympic Youth Delhi club, later renamed the Otto Peltzer Memorial Athletic Club in his honor. In 1970 Peltzer was found dead on a path near the car park, having collapsed after attending an athletics meeting in Eutin. In 2000 the DLV launched the “Otto-Peltzer-Medaille” for personalities in athletics, which was to be given to an outstanding and responsible athlete with a critical solidarity in German athletics.

Unfortunately, Montgomery is not well remembered for any of his track exploits. That world record was voided in 2005 when Montgomery was implicated in the BALCO (Bay Area Laboratory Co-operative) Scandal, and was found guilty of using performance-enhancing drugs. Also implicated in BALCO was Montgomery’s partner at the time, former American sprint star Marion Jones. In April 2006, Montgomery was indicted and arrested on fraud charges for his alleged involvement in check-fraud. Montgomery pleaded guilty to the charges in April 2007, and was sentenced to 46 months in prison in May 2008. Jones also served six months in prison for lying about her knowledge of the check-fraud scheme. Before that was settled Montgomery was accused of dealing heroin in the Hampton Roads area of Virginia. He denied the charges but in October 2008 was found guilty and eventually served a total prison term of 4½ years in a minimum-security prison in Alabama. After his release from prison, Montgomery embraced Christianity, raised his daughter and helped train athletes in Gainesville, Florida.

Hyman started college at El Camino College but then transferred to the University of Houston, where she was the school’s first female scholarship athlete. Hyman played on the US team from 1974-84, missing out on the 1980 Olympics because of the US-led boycott. In addition to her 1984 Olympic silver medal, Hyman won a bronze medal at the 1982 World Championships and a bronze medal at the 1983 Pan American Games. After the Olympics Hyman played professionally in Japan with Daiei team. In 1986 she planned to return to the United States but while playing a match on 24 January 1986, Hyman was subbed out, and while on the sidelines, collapsed and died. She was later found to have Marfan’s Syndrome, a congenital disease causing weakness of collagen in the body, which can manifest itself with weakness and enlargement of the arteries. Hyman was found to have died from a dissecting thoracic aortic aneurysm. With her disease, she was considered fortunate to have survived as long as she did while playing volleyball. Hyman received numerous honors posthumously. The Flo Hyman Memorial Award is given out annually by the US Volleyball Association to the best female player in the United States. The National Girls and Women in Sports Day (NGWSD), is celebrated in all 50 states with a variety of activities, in her memory.
