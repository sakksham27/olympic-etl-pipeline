His son Charles succeeded as the fourth Baron but the Baronetcy ceased less than a year later following Charles’s death.",

His only significant victories at the senior level had come at the 1993 US collegiate championships (not a varsity sport), and the 1995 US Target Championships, and he had only been on the US National Team since 1994. With his baggy pants, backwards cap, sun glasses and ponytail, the laidback youngster defeated all opposition in Atlanta to win gold medals in both the individual and team competitions. This led to a minor popularity boost for the sport – actress Geena Davis picked up the sport and competed in the Olympic Trials for Sydney. But Huish dealt with other issues at that time. Although still competing, in February 2000 he was arrested for the sale and possession of marijuana to a police informant. Huish resigned his spot on the national team, pleaded “no contest.” After he had recovered from that problem, Huish attempted to qualify for the Olympics in 2004, but failed.",

At the 1971 European Championships Bondarchuk finished only third, but was still considered as the favorite for the 1972 Olympic gold. In the Olympic final, Bondarchuk showed top form by throwing the gold medal mark of 75.50 in the first round. After the 1972 Olympics, Bondarchuk competed at the 1974 European Championships, but was eliminated in qualifying. After the 1974 Europeans Bondarchuk decided to quit athletics and started to guide young Soviet hammer throwers Yuriy Siedykh and Jüri Tamm, but made a brief comeback in 1976 to compete at the Olympics, where he won a bronze medal. He was Soviet Champion in 1969-70 and 1972-73 and won silver in 1976. Bondarchuk later became one of the world’s most renowned hammer throwing coaches.

In 1958 Australia’s Herb Elliott finished in third place. Hewson’s mentor was the legendary Austrian-born coach Franz Stampfl, who coached Roger Bannister to his historic four-minute mile in 1954. At the 1955 British Games at the White City, Hewson finished third in what was dubbed “the greatest mile race” at that time. Prior to the race, only Roger Bannister and John Landy had run a sub-four-minute mile. After the race, a further three names were added to that list as Hungary’s László Tábori, and the British pair of Chris Chataway and Hewson all went under four minutes. Hewson clocked 3:59.8 and, in finishing third, made history as the first man to break the four-minute barrier not to finish in the first two. On the International stage, Hewson competed in the 1956 and 1960 Olympics, with a best finish of fifth in the 1,500 metres at Melbourne, despite leading going into the final straight. Four years later in Rome, he was eliminated in his 800 heat when overtaken by three men after leading for 700 metres. Hewson won two British Empire and Commonwealth Games 880 silver medals, in 1954 and 1958. Just a month after winning the second of those medals, he enjoyed his finest moment by winning the European Championships gold at Stockholm in 3:41.9. After the 1960 Olympics, and 20 international appearances behind him, Hewson retired from athletics and concentrated on his job in a Savile Row tailors, before opening his own company in the East End of London. He later became a sports goods buyer for Debenhams and was then involved in the design and manufacture of uniforms for leading national companies. Hewson took up greyhound-ownership as a hobby in 1959, and the following year came close to lifting the sport’s top prize, the Greyhound Derby at the White City, but his runner Clonalvy Romance was narrowly beaten into second place. “Romance” also finished second in that year’s Welsh Derby.

23447,Nils Rydström,Male,15 September 1921,,, Sweden,SWE,"Nils Rydström represented Sweden in foil fencing at two editions of the Olympics Games. In 1948, he finished fourth in his round one pool, after winning four bouts and losing three. This qualified him for the quarter-finals, where he lost all six of his bouts and was eliminated. He performed better in 1952, winning five of his seven bouts in the first round to tie for first in his pool with Luke Wendon of Great Britain and Norwegian Leif Klette. This time, however, he advanced beyond the quarter-finals after winning four of his six bouts and placing third overall. In the semi-finals, however, he won only one of his five matches and did not advance further. In the team event, he was eliminated in the quarter-finals alongside Rolf Magnusson, Sven Fahlman, and Bo Eriksson. Rydström had better luck at the World Championships. In 1950, he won a bronze medal in the team épée, alongside Fahlman, Per Carleson, Carl Forssell, Berndt-Otto Rehbinder, and the non-Olympian Ingemar Bondeson. In 1954, he captured silver in the same event with almost the same lineup, as Bondeson was replaced with another non-Olympian, Bengt Ljungqvist. Rydström lived in England for a period of time and attained the rank of Commodore. He later returned to Stockholm, however, where he died in September 2018 at the age of 97.",Nephew of Erik Granfelt Nephew of Nils Granfelt Nephew of Hans Granfelt Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the World Fencing Championships (0–1–1 1950 Monte Carlo bronze: épée team; 1954 Luxembourg silver: épée team)

They were Canadian champions again in 1963, and also claimed a North American title. In 1964 they took another Canadian championship and won bronze medals at the World Championships and the Winter Olympic Games before retiring at the end of the season. Several weeks later, however, it was discovered that the silver medal winners from Germany, Marika Kilius and Hans-Jürgen Bäumler, had signed professional contracts before the Olympics and had therefore not been eligible to participate. Wilkes and Revell were then awarded silver, but Kilius and Bäumler were never officially removed as silver medalists by the ISU and, in 1987, had their medals returned by the German National Olympic Committee. In total, therefore, four silver medals were awarded for the event. After the duo split, Revell skated with the Ice Capades for several years and took a job as a skating coach in Vancouver.

At the age of 16 Ernst Vettori débuted in his first World Cup event in Innsbruck during the Four Hills Tournament in 1981. Already in February of the same year he won silver at the World Junior Ski Championships and finished second in Chamonix to make his first World Cup podium. In 1982 he became World Junior Champion after winning on a K-70 hill in front of his home crowd in Murau. Vettori participated in the 1984 Winter Olympics and the 1984 Nordic World Ski Championships, but he had to wait until December 1984 to win his first World Cup competition, which came at Oberstdorf as part of the Four Hills Tournament. In the same season he was also a member of the Austrian team (with Andreas Felder, Armin Kogler, and Günther Stranner) which won silver at the 1985 Nordic World Ski Championships. After finishing third in the World Cup in that season, Vettori finished second in the 1985-86 and 1986-87 seasons, but in both seasons won the Four Hills Tournament, especially important in Austria. In February 1987 Vettori won his only individual medal at the World Championships with bronze on the large hill in Oberstdorf followed by a second bronze medal with the Austrian team (with Andreas Felder and the non-Olympians Richard Schallert and Franz Neuländtner). After changing his style from the outdated classical or parallel style (Däscher technique) which was used in former years, but was no longer competitive, to the new V-technique, Vettori again finished second in the 1989-90 World Cup and won team gold for Austria (with Heinz Kuttin, Stefan Horngacher, and Andreas Felder) at the 1991 Nordic World Ski Championships in Val di Fiemme. In 1992 he crowned his career with an Olympic gold on the normal hill in Albertville and also helped Austria win silver in the team event. Vettori celebrated his last World Cup win in March 1992 and won 15 World Cup competitions in total. Before retiring in 1994 he again won bronze with the Austrian team (with Heinz Kuttin, Stefan Horngacher, and Andreas Goldberger) at the 1993 Nordic World Ski Championships in Falun. The first years after his sports career Vettori worked as a television commentator and expert for Eurosport (1995-99) and after finishing his studies joined the Austrian Ski Association, where he first became marketing director for Nordic sports and in 2010 sports director for ski jumping and Nordic combined.

As the Allied Troops did not allow German sportsmen to compete in military or paramilitary competitions directly after World War II, modern pentathlon and fencing could only be held in special units such as the police. Berckhan was, however, a policeman by profession and therefore was able to train for the modern pentathlon. The West German modern pentathlon delegation then won the internal qualification against East Germany and Berckhan was selected for the team to go to the 1960 Rome Olympics. However, the West German team finished a disappointing 16th, while Berckhan was also a disappointing 55th in the individual competition.

In his junior days, he played with the Whitby Athletics beginning in 1913, then St. Andrews College starting in 1915, both of the Ontario Hockey Association. His first senior level team was the Toronto Aura Lee, with whom he played one season in 1916-1917 before joining the Canadian Flying Corps and serving for over a year in Europe during World War I. After a one-game spell with the Toronto Dentals he was made the star player of the newly-formed Toronto Granites and played with them from 1919 through 1923, celebrating two Allan Cup victories. It was when the Granites were sent to the 1924 Winter Olympics, however, that Watson truly earned his fame: he scored 37 goals in a total of five matches, an Olympic record that is likely never to be challenged, much less broken. Needless to say, Canada won the gold medal in the ice hockey tournament that year and National Hockey League teams rushed to sign members of the Toronto Granites. Despite being offered vast sums of money for the time, including $10,000 from the Toronto St. Pats and $30,000 from the Montreal Maroons, Watson always refused to go professional. Although he ostensibly retired after the Olympics, he did played sporadically with the Parkdale Canoe Club from 1924 through 1927, two games with the Toronto Marlboros during the 1927-1928 season, and three with the Toronto Nationals from 1929 through 1932. He also coached the Toronto National Sea Fleas in 1930 and 1931, and refereed for several OHA games during the 1931 playoffs. In his final year with the Nationals, he coached the team to an Allan Cup victory. He died in 1957 and was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1962 and the International Ice Hockey Hall of Fame in 1998.",Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the World Ice Hockey Championships (1–0–0 1924 Chamonix (Olympics) gold)

Though his father died when he was an infant, he spent his early years in Los Ángeles until the age of seven when he was sent to live with his aunt in Santiago. He attended high school at Liceo Valentín Letelier de Santiago but ultimately did not complete, leaving to help his brother in his job of transporting mining materials. He also served in the military upon turning 18. After being introduced to cycling through a group of his brother’s friends, Iturrate quickly realized his proficiency and started to compete in local races. In 1941, he worked assembling bicycles for Club Cóndor and started racing for them the following year, winning his first race. He remained with Cóndor for five years, later joining the Green Cross club. In 1948, Iturrate set a national record of 2-26:00 in the 100 kilometres time trial, which would go on to stand for more than 55 years. This feat secured his place on the Olympic road race squad, alongside Exequiel Ramírez, Mario Masanés and Rogelio Salcedo. Later that same year, he also set a record time in the Santiago-Rancagua race, 2-15:00. After briefly advancing to the professional ranks, Iturrate retired from competitive cycling in 1952 and later worked as a taxi driver. He married Chilean track athlete and two-time Pan American games gold medalist Eliana Gaete and has three children.",

His family moved to Toronto when he was a youngster and he first played in the junior-level of the Ontario Hockey Association with the University of Toronto from 1918 through 1920, at which point he joined the senior-level Toronto Granites. After taking the Allan Cup in 1922 and 1923, the team was invited to represent Canada at the 1924 Winter Olympics, and Munro was named captain. In five games he scored sixteen goals, helping the Canadians take the gold medal at the hockey tournament that year. At the time, it was also common for players to referee Olympic matches and Munro was chosen to officiate at the Belgium-United States game. Upon his return to Canada, he was signed by the Montreal Maroons for a sum that was rumored to have made him the wealthiest professional ice hockey player of his time and he was named team captain. At the conclusion of only their second season, Munro led the team to a Stanley Cup victory in 1926, and they reached the finals again in 1928, losing to the New York Rangers. He was considered the linchpin of the team and, indeed, when he suffered a heart attack after only one game the following season, then later contracted pneumonia in the hospital, the team’s standings in the league suffered. The following year, he was named team coach and manager and stayed with the Maroons until quitting four games into the 1930-1931 season. He played for the Montreal Canadiens for the 1931-1932 season, but retired from play at the end of 1932 to focus on coaching. Over the next two and a half decades, he suffered several heart attacks, causing his health to decline severely, and died in 1958, at the age of 56.",Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the World Ice Hockey Championships (1–0–0 1924 Chamonix (Olympics) gold) Listed in Olympic Champions Who Have Played in a Stanley Cup Winning Team (Olympic Gold – 1924; Stanley Cup Champion – 1926 Montréal Maroons.)

Growing up in Tottenham, he first came onto the British wrestling scene in the early 1910s, winning the Middlesex freestyle middleweight title in 1913. In 1914, he enlisted to serve in the territorial force with the 7th Battalion Middlesex Regiment, but was discharged in 1916 after being found physically unfit for service due to poor eyesight (he had congenital aphakia, the absence of the lens, in both eyes) and being clubfooted. These conditions, however, did not limit Wilson in his sporting exploits. A longtime member of the Ashdown Athletic Club in Islington, W. G. Wilson competed at two Olympic Games, firstly at 1920 Antwerpen (Antwerp) where he lost a decision to American John Redman in only 25 seconds, competing in the light-heavyweight class. In the following years, Wilson went on to win two consecutive national heavyweight titles (1922–23) before being selected once again for the Olympic Games in 1924 where he was the eldest member of the British wrestling team. In Paris, he was classified joint sixth as as a result of finishing runner-up to Sweden’s Rudolf Svensson in the 2nd place competition final, which was open to wrestlers beaten by the eventual gold medallist John Spellman of the USA. Retiring from the sport shortly thereafter, Wilson, a trained carpenter, followed in his father’s vocation as a builder. He was married in 1926 and had one daughter. He switched careers by the early 1930s becoming the proprietor of a garage near his family residence on Lansdowne Road in Tottenham. By the late 1930s, he moved to Chingford, Essex with his family.

There were many falls and punctures, one of which forced Meredith to withdraw.

81617,Nathalie Lambert,Female,1 December 1963,170.0,65, Canada,CAN,"Speed skater Nathalie Lambert was on the ice at the age of 12 and competing by 13. Naturally talented, she made the National Team in 1981 and was Speed Skating Canada’s Female Athlete of the Year in the long track discipline in 1986. Yet by that time her interests had shifted into the evolving field of short track speed skating and the following year she set a world record in the 3,000m event and was runner up at the 1987 World Championships. In 1988 short track speed skating was a demonstration event at that year’s Winter Olympics and, although she did not find as much success as she had in the past, she still took home a bronze medal in the 3,000m relay. By 1990 she had bounced back, however, and won her first of five consecutive honors as Speed Skating Canada’s Female Athlete of the Year, although she shared the 1991 award with Sylvie Daigle. During this time she set another world record in the 3,000m relay at the 1991 World Championships, a tournament at which she took the overall title, and participated in the 1992 Winter Olympics, where short track speed skating was now an official part of the program. Although she placed only sixth in the 500m event, she took gold in the 3,000m relay and was chosen to be Canada’s flagbearer during the closing ceremonies. That year she was also inducted into the Canadian Olympic Hall of Fame and named Athlete of the Year by the Mérite Sportif Québécois. Lambert’s athletic career, however, was not yet over. She was world champion once again in 1993 and set another world record, this time in the 1,000m event. At the 1994 Winter Olympics she was fourteenth at the 500m event, but took home silver medals in the 1,000m competition and the 3,000m relay. When she retired after winning the 1994 World Championship overall title, she had won a gold medal in the 3,000m relay every year at the tournament since 1986. She made a brief comeback in the late 1990s and took home another gold medal in the event at the 1997 World Championships. A broken ankle in November 1997, however, ended her hopes of participating at the 1998 Winter Olympics. In addition to the Canadian Olympic Hall of Fame, she was inducted into the Speed Skating Hall of Fame in 1991, the Quebec Sports Hall of Fame in 2001, and the Canada Sports Hall of Fame in 2002. In 2004 she was assistant Chef de Mission for the athletes at that year’s Summer Olympic Games and was named Chef de Mission outright for the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver.","Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the World Short Track Speed Skating Championships (15–3–2 1983 Tokyo gold: 3000 m relay; 1984 Peterborough gold: 3000 m relay, bronze: Allround; 1985 Amsterdam silver: 3000 m relay, bronze: Allround; 1986 Chamonix gold: 3000 m relay, silver: Allround; 1987 Montréal gold: 3000 m relay, silver: Allround; 1988 St. Louis gold: 3000 m relay; 1989 Solihull gold: 3000 m relay; 1990 Amsterdam gold: 3000 m relay; 1991 Sydney gold: Allround and 3000 m relay; 1992 Denver gold: 3000 m relay; 1993 Beijing gold: Allround and 3000 m relay; 1994 Guildford gold: Allround and 3000 m relay; 1997 Nagano gold: 3000 m relay) Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the World Short Track Speed Skating Team Championships (3–1–0 1990 Gent gold; 1991 Seoul gold; 1994 Cambridge gold; 1997 Seoul silver)"

2000592,Brian Boydell,Male,17 March 1917,,, Ireland,IRL,"Brian Boydell was born into a well-to-do Anglo-Irish family. During his school years in Rugby, he was strongly influenced by his music teacher. Although he already composed his first songs during a subsequent stay in Heidelberg and received a scholarship for Cambridge, he took up studies in natural sciences, which he completed in 1938. Eventually, he entered the Royal College of Music in London and studied composition. In addition to piano, he also learned to play oboe. At the beginning of World War II, Boydell returned to Dublin and completed his studies at Trinity College. After a short time in his father’s malt business, he became director of the Dublin Orchestra in 1943. The following year, he was appointed professor of voice at the Royal Irish Academy of Music. Together with other composers he founded the Irish Music Association in 1948. In 1962 Boydell took up a post as professor of music at Trinity College and reformed the study course. As a presenter of music programs on RTÉ, Boydell introduced many people to classical music. He also devoted himself to surrealist painting and took lessons from Mainie Jellett. After his retirement, he wrote books on music theory and was elected to the exclusive circle of Aosdána, which honors outstanding Irish personalities. As a young composer, Boydell was influenced by the music of Béla Bartók and Jean Sibelius and sought to combine Irish music with European traditions. In Memoriam Mahatma Gandhi (op. 30), a 12-minute orchestral piece, was his first major success in 1948. He composed the work immediately after Gandhi’s assassination. At the premiere, the composer himself conducted the Radio Éireann Symphony Orchestra in the Phoenix Hall in Dublin. In the following 50 years Boydell composed a wide range of music, including orchestral works and chamber music but also compositions for voice or solo instruments. In 1961 he wrote a new orchestral version of the Irish national anthem for the launch of television in Ireland, which was played daily at the start of the program for many years.",

He was the most successful German long distance runner of all-time and, thru 2011, is still the fastest non-African over 5,000 metres. Beside his Olympic success he took part in five World Championships: 1987 (1,500 semifinal), 1991 (5K 4th), 1995 (5K 9th), 1997 (5K 5th) and 2003 (10K dnf). Even more successful were his appearances at the European Championships: 1994 gold in the 5000 metres, and 1998 and 2002 silver in the 10K. This was complemented by 40 national titles in distances between 1,500 and 10,000 m and cross-country running. He retired in 2003. In 1999 Baumann was tested positive for nandrolone, with a blood level 20 times above the allowable limit. The muscle-building steroid was found in a tube of toothpaste, possibly placed there by clandestine means. He was suspended for two years by the German Track & Field Association DLV, but the suspension was lifted in 2000; however, the IAAF did not lift the ban. To prove his innocence, Baumann and his wife took a lie detector test at the Psychological Institute of the University of Cologne, where it was found that Baumann, with a “probability of about 95%” told the truth, in his claims to have never knowingly taken doping substances. The doping scandal – in which Baumann repeatedly accused competitors of manipulation – was publicized in 2004 under the title Ich will Laufen! Der Fall Dieter Baumann (I want to run! The case of Dieter Baumann). The case itself, however, remained unexplained. Since 1995, while working as a photo lab technician, Baumann also worked as a columnist for the taz and the journal Runner’s World.

48186,Alfréd Hajós,Male,1 February 1878,,, Hungary,HUN,"As a 13-year-old boy, Arnold Guttmann saw his father drown in the Danube, after which he felt the urge to become a good swimmer. With the growing Hungarian nationalism and the impending 1000-year existence of the country, he changed his surname to Hajós (“sailor”). At age 17, he won the European Championships in the 100 m freestyle held in Vienna (1895), and added the Austro-Hungarian title the next day. Hajós was selected for the Hungarian team for the first Olympics in Athens, where he hoped to swim all events. Because of the tight schedule, he could only compete in the 100 and 1200 m freestyle, but won both races. Hajós retained his European title several months later, although not after his compatriot Gräfl had been disqualified. He placed fifth at the 1897 European Championships, after which he gave more attention to other sports. He won a number of Hungarian track and field titles, in events as varied as the discus throw and the hurdles. He also played football, winning the Hungarian title and playing on the national team. He was coach of the Hungarian squad between 1906 and 1908. Hajós won another Olympic medal in 1924, in the art contests. His design for a stadium, co-designed by former tennis player Dezső Lauber, won a silver medal. In addition to Walter Winans, he became the only Olympian to win a medal in sports and art competitions. Outside of this competition, Hajós designed many sports facilities too. Among the best known are Budapest’s swimming stadium (which hosted the 1958, 2006, and 2010 European Championships), and the Újpest FC stadium. In 1899 Hajós graduated as an architect at the Technical University of Budapest. Five years later, he opened his own office with his partner János Villányi and became independent after the First World War. From 1948, he was technical advisor to the Design Office for Building Construction and was involved in the reconstruction of large public buildings. His main work is the antique style design from 1924 for the Hungarian stadium for 50,000 spectators, whose realization was prevented by the outbreak and the consequences of World War I. In 1919 it was planned to build the facility on the Margaret Island instead on the originally considered Vérmező army terrain. Finally, the site of a former horse racing track in the XIV. District was envisaged. There, the Nép-Stadium was eventually built after World War II. In 1928 and 1932, Hajós competed again as an architect in the art competitions. His 14 exhibits from 1928 are probably related to the design of a sports forum, which would include an open and covered swimming pool, a gymnasium, an institute for the training of sports teachers and the physical education authority in addition to the stadium. In 1932, Hajós submitted plans and other exhibits for the swimming pool on Margaret Island planned in 1930. The pool was extended in 1937 and refurbished in 2000. It was the first indoor swimming pool in the world, and the building served as the European standard for a long time. The building is characterized by a bold use of reinforced concrete as well as modern use of space and facades. In 1953, Hajós was awarded the Olympic Diploma of Merit by the IOC.",Brother of Henrik Hajós Listed in Olympians With Asteroids Named After Them (151242 Hajós)

He regularly exhibited in prestigious shows alongside many esteemed painters. Eilleen Gardner Galer wrote a biography of him in 1995.

With the show he travelled to the United States and continued to work all kinds of occasional jobs. He served in the US Army in World War I and in The Philippines before he concentrated on his art education at the Corcoran School of Art.

Later he was also involved in the design of the decoration of the Galeries Lafayette in Paris as well as in the design of various postage stamps in Poland. Gronowski studied architecture at the Warsaw Technical University from 1915-25 and then went to Paris to continue his studies at the École des Beaux Arts for two years. Early on he worked as a graphic artist for art magazines and additionally as a commercial artist. In 1923 he was a co-founder of the studio for commercial art “Plakat” and in 1933 of the Association of Commercial Artists. After World War II, he was the chairman of the Association of Polish Artists for a long time and was appointed professor at the Academy in Warszawa. At this time, he turned to painting. Gronowski designed the first Polish Olympic poster for the 1920 Olympic Games, advertising a sports week to promote the Polish début at the Olympics in Antwerp. This poster – originally a color lithograph measuring 110 x 80 cm – achieved a wide impact thanks to a postcard edition as a newspaper supplement. Poland, however, cancelled its participation at short notice because of the war against Russia. Whether this poster was Gronowski’s entry for the 1932 art competitions is unknown.",

At Sandhurst, Barrington-Ward was a fine cross-country runner, and after joining the Royal Artillery he continued running and won the prestigious inter-services title. For the 1952 Olympics, Barrington-Ward, along with Tony Somers and Edward Dyson, competed in the three-man Dragon class in Somers’ boat Sabre. Barrington-Ward had no yachting experience, and Somers deliberately recruited a novice with the purpose of training him to be responsible for the spinnaker on the foredeck and, just four months before the Helsinki Olympics, Barrington-Ward sailed for the first time.

She finished second in that event in 1980, was second in the 1978 and 1979 World Sprints, and was expected to join her brother, Eric Heiden, in picking up a slew of medals at Lake Placid.

Heiden did not skate competitively after the 1980 season, but she kept in shape. Later in 1980, she became the second American to win the cycling road race at the Women’s World Championships (after Audrey McElmury in 1969), and for awhile it seemed cycling had become her primary sport, as she also won the Coors Classic stage race that year.

He made his senior World Cup debut two years later, with a sixth-place finish in a giant slalom event, and placed seventh in his first World Championship appearance in 1991. He first represented Switzerland at the Winter Olympics in 1992, where he was seventh in the slalom and joint-thirteenth (with Stéphane Exartier of France) in the giant slalom. He earned his first World Cup podium finish, a victory, the following year in the giant slalom, and followed it up with a third-place finish later in the season. At the 1994 Winter Games he was 15th in the slalom and failed to complete the giant slalom. Grünigen’s prowess began to be felt after these Games, and he had 11 additional podium finishes, six of which were victories, at the World Cup prior to the 1996 World Championships, where he captured bronze medals in the slalom and the giant slalom. The following year he became World Champion in the giant slalom and earned his second of four World Cup giant slalom titles (the others came in 1996, 1999, and 2003). His next major stop was the 1998 Winter Olympics, where he was 19th in the slalom, but won bronze in the giant slalom. He slipped to seventh in the giant slalom at the 1999 World Championships, and finished 12th in the slalom, but was crowned world champion in the giant slalom once again in 2001, where he was also 22nd in the slalom. He attended his final Olympics in 2002, but placed 11th in the giant slalom and 14th in the slalom. Grünigen retired from active competition shortly after a seventh-place finish in the giant slalom at the 2003 World Championships.

Because of this, during the 1948 Israeli War, his store was not placed under government administration, as was done with most Jewish businesses. After a military coup ousted King Farouk in July 1952, the Cicurel store still enjoyed a high level of protection because of his affiliation with members of the Free Officers due to his reputation and accomplishments. The Free Officers even helped rebuild the store after the Cairo Fire of January 1952. This changed during the 1956 Suez Crisis, and the store was placed under government control.

Both studied from 1912 at the École National des Arts Décoratifs in Paris and worked as sculptors, designers and interior designers. They applied new or rarely used materials in sculpture and often collaborated with architects such as Robert Mallet-Stevens. In 1929, they were among the founding members of the Union des Artistes Modernes, and were both best-known for their ornamental sculptures, statues, monuments and fountains displaying characteristics typical of the Art Déco and Cubist periods, which included a monument to the great French composer and musician Claude Debussy. Their avant-garde sculptures for their four concrete Cubist (trees) designed for a garden setting at the 1925 Exposition des Arts Décoratifs et Industriels Modernes in Paris became especially well-known. Both were closely tied to their native region, the Vendée, and died in 1966, about six months apart from one another, Jan in an accident and Joël as the result of a long struggling illness. The brothers usually did not individually sign their works, so the separate assignment in the 1948 art catalog may not be correct. The Polo Player, a 60 cm high and long sculpture, dates back to 1930. The first version is still missing the quarter disks, which can be seen on a picture dated 1934. In 2002, eighth bronze casts were made. In 1948, a plaster model was entered. The same motif also appears on a medal. The Bicycling Trophy was made of aluminum, but could not be identified until now.",Twin brother of Joël Martel

She first represented her nation as a senior at that year’s Summer Olympics, but finished last in her heat in the K1-500 and failed to qualify for the finals in the K4-500 (alongside Barb Olmsted, Nancy Olmsted, and Sheila Taylor). She had improved by the 1992 Games, finishing 7th in the K1-500 and 6th in the K4-500 (with Alison Herst, Klara MacAskill, and Kevyn Stafford), and won her first World Championship medal, bronze in the K1-500, in 1993. After earning bronze twice more, in the K1-200 and the K4-200 (alongside Herst, MacAskill, and Corrina Kennedy) at the 1994 World Championships, she had a breakthrough year in 1995, winning the K4-200 title (with Herst, Kennedy, and Marie-Josée Gibeau-Ouimet) and silver medals in the K1-200 and K1-500 at the World Championships. She followed up on her success with silver in the K1-500 at the 1996 Summer Olympics, losing the gold medal to Rita Kőbán of Hungary by just 0.2 seconds, but earning Canada’s first canoeing podium finish since 1984. Brunet was dominant at the next three World Championships, winning the K1-200, 500, and 1000 titles each year, except in 1998, when she was second in the K1-1000 behind Josefa Idem-Guerrini. She also captured silver in the K2-500 in 1999 alongside Karen Furneaux, the same year she was awarded the Lou Marsh Trophy as Canada’s most outstanding athlete. Expectations for her were high at the 2000 Summer Olympics, where she served as her nation’s flagbearer in the opening ceremony. She lost the K1-500 gold medal to Idem-Guerrini, this time by just over 0.8 seconds, and came in 5th in the K2-500 with Furneaux. Following these Games, Brunet’s long career began to wind down. She took home silver medals in the K-1 200 and K-1 500 at the 2002 World Championships and won the K-1 200 a final time in 2003, in addition to a bronze medal in the K2-1000 alongside Mylanie Barré.

On the final straight, Hill moved out to pass Lehtinen, but the Finn blocked him, zig-zagging from one lane to the other to the great exasperation of the American crowd, and Lehtinen held off Hill for the gold medal. The crowd in the LA Coliseum was unhappy and severely booed Lehtinen, causing the address announcer, Bill Henry, to warn them, “Please, remember. These people are our guests.” Hill declined to protest, and they both were both given the time of 14:30.0. At the 1936 Summer Olympics, Lehtinen couldn’t defend his title, finishing second behind fellow Finn Gunnar Höckert. Lehtinen won Finnish 5K titles in 1931 and 1935.

He was seriously injured in World War I. From 1925 Pape taught for 35 years at the School of Applied Arts and Crafts in Münster. He left behind an extensive body of work as an illustrator and designed numerous publications and symbols for the city of Münster. His style, initially close to Expressionism and working with hard contrasts, was gradually replaced by a more objective, realistic representation. The original document designed by Pape for the Reich youth competitions was apparently in use from 1929-1932. However, the text changed slightly. In addition, a draft of a certificate for the city of Münster could be discovered. Whether it is the one submitted as Kohlurkunde (literally Cabbage Certificate) is unknown.

In 1922 the family moved by motorbike and sidecar to Canvey Island and built a bungalow on a plot of land they had bought. Roland and his younger brother Frank enjoyed the outdoor-life at their new home, and when the two siblings were barely five-years-of-age, their father built them a canoe in which to traverse a local creek. Their father started a boat-building business in 1935 and Roland and Frank helped out in the business whenever they could. The business eventually became very successful as G. Prout & Sons. In 1964, one of their catamarans was the first multihull vessel to circumnavigate the earth, and in 1989 they won a Queen’s Award for Industry. In the early 1950s, Prouts made the world’s first production catamaran, the Shearwater, and with it came the Shearwater class of racing. Prouts catamarans became well known all over the world, and in 1963 they launched the 77ft (23.5m) Tsulamaran at Canvey Island. It was the largest European-built catamaran at the time. Roland and Frank Prout were no newcomers to canoe racing in the post-war era and won seven prizes at the Chertsey regatta in 1949. An outdated amateur status rule, however, forbade them from competing in National Championships because they were professional boat builders. This rule changed, however, and in 1951 they made up for their long absence by winning the K-2 1,000 and 10,000 metres titles at the 1951 National Championships. Roland also won the K-1 1,000 title. The siblings added the K-2 500 in 1952, had a clean sweep of all three kayak pairs titles in 1953, and rounded off their career by capturing the K-2 1,000 and 10,000 in 1954. Prior to the 1952 Olympics, the brothers spent some weeks in Sweden training with the 1948 Olympic gold medallist Hans Berglund, but they disappointed at Helsinki by finishing seventh and last in the opening heat in the K-2 1,000 metres. Roland later became a very successful catamaran racer.",Brother of Frank Prout

Yet upon witnessing Nadia Comăneci’s performance at the 1976 Summer Olympics and professing her desire to become an Olympic champion, her thoughts did not immediately turn to aquatics. She took up competitive aquatics only after trying her hand in tennis and figure skating, but was sufficiently talented to make the Canadian national swimming team in 1981. She burst onto the international scene in 1982, winning silver and bronze in the 100 and 200 meter breaststroke events respectively at the World Championships. She followed this up with gold in the 200 m breaststroke and the 4×100 m medley relay (with Cheryl Gibson, Michelle MacPherson, and Maureen New) and silver in the 100 m breaststroke at that year’s Commonwealth Games. A favorite in the 200 m at the 1983 Pan American Games, she was disqualified from that event for an allegedly illegal kick, but captured gold in the 100 m and silver in the 4×100 m medley relay. She then prepared for the 1984 Summer Olympics, but was unable to participate in the trials after dislocating her kneecap in a fall. Despite this, she was given a spot on the delegation, a wise decision on behalf of the Canadians, as she won a medal in every event in which she participated: gold in the 200 m, silver in the 100 m, and bronze in the 4×100 m medley relay (alongside MacPherson, Reema Abdo, and Pam Rai). As of 2012 she remains the only Canadian female to have won a gold medal at the Olympics. Ottenbrite entered the University of Southern California in her Olympic year and retired from the Canadian national team in 1986, having won five Canadian national championships. She transferred to Wilfred Laurier University in 1987, graduated in 1990, and has since worked as a coach for numerous clubs, Swim Ontario, Wilfred Laurier, and the University of Guelph.

Of Jewish ancestry from Morocco, he was a member of the Racing Hockey Club by the age of 16 and is noted among their archives as being one of their top players. In 1926 he not only became the national champion in the 400 metres, but also set a new record (37 seconds) at the 300m distance and captured the junior championships in all three fencing categories. Two years later he repeated the latter feat, this time as a senior competitor. By 1930 his interests had shifted to automobile racing and that year he won the Anfa Grand Prix in his native country in a French-made Amilcar. He remained athletically active throughout his life and attended the 1960 Summer Olympics as both a fencing coach and competitor. In the team épée event he was the victor in two of the squad’s five winning bouts, which was not enough for the Moroccans to advance beyond the first round.",
95364,Vladimir Melanin,Male,1 December 1933,172.0,74, Soviet Union,URS,"Vladimir Melanin was the first Soviet biathlete to win an Olympic and World Championships. He started his sporting career as a cross-country skier, but switched to biathlon while serving in the Soviet Army. As a mediocre shooter, he won most of his titles thanks to strong skiing. Melanin made his international début at the 1959 World Championships, where he won gold medals in the 20 km and relay. At the 1960 Olympics, Melanin had one of the best skiing times, but managed only fourth place because of poor shooting. Melanin missed the 1961 World Championships, but again won both the 20 km and relay at the 1962 and 1963 World Championships. At the 1964 Olympics, Melanin had a very strong skiing time, but this time he surprised everyone with clean shooting rounds to win a gold medal, nearly 3½ minutes ahead of his teammate, Aleksandr Privalov. This is still the largest victory margin in any Olympic biathlon event. Melanin made his last international appearance at the 1965 World championships, where he won a silver as a member of the Soviet relay team and was seventh in 20 km. Domestically Melanin won only two Soviet titles, in 1959 and 1966, both in the 20 km race. After his competitive career Melanin worked as a biathlon coach and managed a cross-country skiing and biathlon complex in his native Kirov Oblast. After his death in 1995 Vladimir Melanin received posthumously the International Biathlon Union Honorary Award.","Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the World Biathlon Championships (3–0–0 1959 Courmayeur gold: 20 km and team (unoffical); 1962 Hämeenlinna gold: 20 km and team (unoffical); 1963 Seefeld gold: 20 km and team (unoffical); 1965 Elverum silver: team (unoffical), bronze: 4×7.5 km relay (unoffical))"

He went to the 1956 Winter Olympics as a substitute, but Gunder Gundersen injured his arm two days before the competition and Knutsen was placed on the team, and he finished sixth, only 2.6 points out of silver. In 1958 Knutsen won at Holmenkollen, and after winning national championship gold medals in both 1959 and 1960, he was highly favored for the Olympic gold at Squaw Valley. Before leaving for Squaw Valley, Knutsen surprised everybody by winning a silver medal at the Norwegian Championships in ski jumping. In Squaw Valley, a newcomer from West Germany, Georg Thoma, led the jumping, but the Norwegians considered him a weak cross-country skier and reckoned Knutsen for a gold medal. However, Thoma surprised everybody in the cross-country, skiing 7.2 seconds faster than Knutsen and was a clear winner, with the Norwegian taking silver. Thoma dominated the international scene in Nordic combined in the following years, but Knutsen continued to compete, placing fourth at the 1962 World Championships. After winning two more national championships (1963 and 1964), he felt well prepared for the 1964 Innsbruck Olympics. He placed second in the jumping section, only 2.2 points behind Thoma, but Knutsen was over 1½ minutes better than Thoma in cross-country and won the gold medal comfortably. Thoma got revenge over Knutsen by winning at Holmenkollen later in the season, where Knutsen was a distant sixth, after which the 32-year-old Norwegian ended his career, with his old dream of an Olympic gold medal having come true.",Listed in Olympians Who Were Awarded the Holmenkollmedaljen (1960)

Bevilacqua became the new face of the Italian athletics, but declined many offers to work as a model. Bevilacqua’s best year was 1996 when she finished fourth at the Atlanta Olympics with a personal best 1.99. She had not missed a height up to that mark, and only failed when the bar went to 2.01.

921652,Mahonri Mackintosh Young,Male,9 August 1877,,, United States,USA,"Mahonri Mackintosh Young, a sculptor and painter from Salt Lake City, came from a distinguished Mormon family, as he was the grandson of Brigham Young, second President of the church and first Governor of Utah. Mahonri Young had studied in his hometown and New York before he went for further education to Paris. After his return to Utah in 1905 he began his career as a sculptor. However, it was only after he moved to New York that he had considerable success and won numerous awards. In 1912 he created the Seagull Monument in Salt Lake City’s Temple Square. From 1916-43 he taught at the Art Students League and wrote the book “The Realistic Revolt in American Painting.” His main works were monumental sculptures of Native Americans and projects for 20th Century Fox Studios. Later he turned to social realism and portrayed workers and peasants. He lived mainly in New York, but remained in close contact with the Mormon Church. Even though best known for his sculptures, he was also a painter and graphic artist of note. Young submitted a total of 16 exhibits in three fields (painting, drawings, sculptures), five of these “hors concours”. His gold medal winning sculpture of two boxers, The Knockdown, a 65 x 78 cm bronze group, is now preserved in the Smithsonian American Art Museum in Washington, DC. It was created in 1931 as one of the last of his boxer statuettes. A few years earlier, in 1927, The Winner was produced, also titled Da Winnah in slang. The 84 x 38 x 23 cm plaster model is in the Art Museum at Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah, a bronze cast in the Springville Museum. Joe Gans is a bronze portrait of one of the first black professional boxers and is located in Madison Square Garden, where boxers consider the statue as a lucky charm. Bob Fitzsimmons was another study of a boxing world champion. The 53 cm high plaster figure is also in the Art Museum at Brigham Young University. The following works were entered “hors concours”: A Right to the Jaw (1926-1927, bronze, 38 x 54 x 26, Smithsonian American Art Museum), Groggy (1926, bronze, 36 x 21 x 21, Whitney Museum of American Art), Bantams (also known as Two Bantams, 1927, plaster, 51 x 26 x 41 cm, Brigham Young University Museum of Art) and On the Button (bronze, 36 x 59 cm, Art Museum at Brigham Young University). Of Young’s eight paintings and graphic works, he submitted At the Tap of the Gong, a sparsely lit scene of a boxing match, “out of competition”. The painting in oil on canvas (45.7 x 50.8 cm) had already been created in 1906. Beat Him at the Punch was a 1932 etching sized 20.3 x 30.2 cm, a print of which is in the Smithsonian American Art Museum. Main Street Athletic Club, Los Angeles was based on a drawing. It is more likely, however, that the respective etching was exhibited in 1932. The five Drawings of a Prize Fight numbered I to V could not be identified. There are actual sketches and partly colored drawings of boxing matches by Young, but they cannot be assigned to the entries.",

Sinding-Larsen was commissioned in 1919 to complement the planned national gymnastics school with sports fields and a stadium. The additional requirements demanded a rescheduling and were introduced into the submitted draft.

Although he eventually missed selection for the team pursuit he had established himself as a rising star and in 1993 won the national title in the kilometre time trial. This was the first of what would become fifteen national track titles in four separate disciplines, the kilometre, individual pursuit, madison and points race. After an inauspicious Olympic début in 1996 he suffered ill luck at the Sydney Games missing a medal in the individual pursuit then being brought down in a multi-rider crash whilst in second place in the Madison. Later in 2000 he won his first world championship medals on home boards in Manchester. For the next three years he concentrated on road racing and signed to ride for the French Cofidis team but a serious car crash in which he suffered a triple fracture of the pelvis impeded his progress and his only performance of note during his three seasons with Cofidis was a second place at the British Road Race Championships in 2002. At the end of 2003 he returned to the track and rejoined the British pursuit team to place second at the World Championships. This feat was repeated at the Athens Olympics and he also partnered Bradley Wiggins to bronze in the Madison. His two world title victories were both recorded in 2005. A win as part of the team pursuit was not unexpected but his victory in the Madison alongside a precocious teenager called Mark Cavendish was a major surprise. The success continued in 2006 with appearances on the podium at the Commonwealth Games and Track World Championship but this proved to be the high point of his career. Suspended from the 2008 World Championship due to a high haematocrit level, he was overlooked for the Beijing Olympics and retired from the track at the end of the year though he did have of the satisfaction of being crowned British road race champion during the summer. Hayles continued to race in British domestic road racing for a further three seasons until announcing his retirement in 2011. By then he had also begun a career as a television and radio commentator.

His most well-known success came at the 1908 Summer Olympics, where he won a gold medal in the individual trap shooting contest after leading in all three stages of the event. This came after a controversial scrubbing of the scores from the first round (in which the British trio of Charles Palmer, Richard Hutton, and John Postans had held the lead), following a Canadian protest. He also took silver in the team event, alongside George Beattie, Mylie Fletcher, David McMackon, George Vivian, and Arthur Westover, after earning the highest score among the Canadians and the second-highest overall, after Great Britain’s Alexander Maunder. Ewing remained in London for a while after the Games, winning several local tournaments, and then returned to Canada, where he captured numerous provincial and national titles. Most notably, he was national champion in the individual trap in 1910 and 1911, and the two and five man team trap in 1910. In 1912, however, he turned down the opportunity to defend his national and Olympic titles and faded into obscurity. He was inducted into Canada’s Sports Hall of Fame in 1958.",

He experimented with several different sports in his youth, but had settled on figure skating by the age of ten, first competing internationally three years later. His first World Junior Championship appearance came in 2007, when he placed 26th, but he improved to 16th the following year. By 2009 he was taking part in the Senior World Championships and, by virtue of his eighth-place finish, he qualified to represent Kazakhstan at the 2010 Winter Olympics. There, he placed 11th among 30 total competitors in the men’s singles event. He was 13th at the year’s World Championships. Ten’s big international breakthrough came at the 2011 Asian Winter Games, where he won the men’s singles tournament, and the following year he came in 7th at the World Championships. At the 2013 edition, however, he was second only to Canada’s Patrick Chan, thus becoming Kazakhstan’s first medalist at the Worlds. Expectations were raised for him at the 2014 Winter Olympics and he did not disappoint, capturing bronze in the men’s singles behind Yuzuru Hanyu of Japan and Chan, making him the first (and as of 2018, only) Kazakhstani figure skating medalist. He carried this momentum to the 2015 World Championships, where he again placed third, this time behind Spain’s Javier Fernández and Hanyu. After this point, injuries began to plague Ten, although he did take gold in the men’s singles at the 2017 Winter Universiade. At the 2018 Winter Olympics, however, he could only manage 27th after the short program and did not qualify for the free skate. He was still preparing for competition when he was stabbed to death after confronting two thieves who were trying to steal the mirrors from his car, giving him the unfortunate distinction of being the first 2018 Winter Olympian to die, just five months after the Games.",Listed in Olympians Who Were Murdered (Stabbed to death on a street in Almaty.)

May was acknowledged to be the leader of that team, and later in 1976, he was the backbone of the U.S. Olympic team, as well. A great pro career was expected of the 6-7 (2.00) forward, but it was not to be, mainly because injuries made him less effective in the pros. May never became the dominant force he was in college, although he played for parts of seven seasons, mostly with Chicago. In the middle of the 1982-83 season, May was released by the Detroit Pistons, and he retired to devote full time to a real estate business he had established for himself.

After the war, Blue Eagle taught at the Oklahoma State Technical School in Okmulgee. Later, he was inducted into the Indian Hall of Fame. His paintings depicted scenes of Native American life with clearly structured color zones. Of his paintings, mostly done with tempera paints, only a few could be definitely attributed to entries of the Olympic Art Competitions, as by far the majority are undated, and motifs such as the buffalo hunt recur several times. A few can be clearly dated from 1932 or could be identified by the title. The painting titled Indian Ball Game and awarded an “Honorable Mention” is probably Stickball. It was likely done in 1932 showing eight Muskogee Native Americans with painted faces and coon or horse tails. They hold sticks of hickory wood in their hands and play ball. The game was a precursor to modern lacrosse. Also dated from 1932 are Sacred Pipe Dance, possibly identical to the Peace Pipe Dance, and the Buffalo Dancer. Identified by title were Feather Dancer, Shield Dancer, Spear and Wheel Game, and Warriors on Horseback.",

His drama La Dîme (The Tithe), which he wrote for the centenary of the canton of Vaud, was set to music by Alexandre Dénéréaz. In 1905, Morax was given artistic responsibility for the Fête des Vignerons of the Canton of Vaud together with his brother Jean, a position he held until 1947. In his biennial dramas, he mostly used biblical, historical, and Romanesque themes, but also village and folk themes. In 1908, Morax opened the Théâtre du Jorat in Mézières. Together with Gustave Doret, he also wrote several operas for this theatre, with Morax being responsible for the librettos. Arthur Honegger wrote the music for his best-known work, König David (King David), inspired by a trip to India in 1919. His other brother Victor became a well-known ophthalmologist. René Morax attended the “Consultative Conference on Art and Literature” organized by Pierre de Coubertin in 1906. He was also close to the popular theater of the Frenchman Maurice Pottecher. Like the latter, he wrote a very positive newspaper article on the results of the conference, L’Esthétique de la Force (The Aesthetics of Strength) in Le Journal de Genève. Based on these connections to the Olympic Movement, René Morax is a likely candidate for the unknown participant in the 1912 Art Competitions, even if the name on the original documents cannot be clearly identified.",

This switch won them 27 kg in weight, but they had to add five more kilogrammes as the boat’s rudder was now above water. Brandt and Klein took the lead from the start, finishing with just one fifth of a second behind the second-placed French team. Brandt also rowed in the Dutch eight, which did use Brockmann as the coxswain, which according to the Dutch coach cost them first or second place. Brandt studied civil engineering in Delft until 1900, and represented the student rowing club LAGA at the Olympics. After his studies, he joined the Dutch railways, where he worked until 1938.

Like Willy Dod, the 1908 men’s champion, Queenie Newall came from one of the oldest families in England – the Newalls are recognized by the College of Arms back to the time of Henry IV in the 14th century. Queenie was the eldest of seven daughters of John and Maria (Fenton) Newall, who maintained a large country estate at Hare Hill in Lancashire. The Fentons were also a prominent Lancashire family and Queenie’s maternal grandfather, John Fenton, twice served as the Liberal MP for Rochdale. Having left Lancashire, Queenie joined Cheltenham Archers in 1905 and made spectacular progress. In 1907 she shot at all five regional meetings, making the highest score in four of them and being placed second in the fifth. At the 1908 Olympic Games, the women archers encountered the same adverse weather conditions as the men and at the end of the first day Queenie Newall trailed the multitalented Lottie Dod by 10 points, but Newall soon moved into the lead on the second day and went on to win the gold medal by 43 points. In less than three years, she had risen from being an obscure archer at a provincial club to become Olympic champion. The greatest British woman archer of all-time, Alice Legh, who won 23 Grand National titles in a 41-year span between 1881 and 1922, chose not to compete at the 1908 Olympics, but the following week in the Grand National meeting at Oxford she defeated Newall by the huge margin of 151 points. Newall’s success at these championships would come later; she won the title in 1911 and 1912, and in 1914 she only missed a third victory by just three points. She continued shooting after the war and her last recorded score was with the Cheltenham Archers in September 1928 at the age of 74.",

He established the Gray Rocks Inn in 1930, which served as both an expansion of the ski resort founded by his father George in 1905 and a kennel that bred the common ancestor of the Seppala Siberian Sleddog and the Siberian Husky. He used some of those animals to compete in the dog sled demonstration event at the 1932 Winter Olympics, where he placed fourth in a field of twelve starting competitors. Wheeler continued racing through the end of the 1930s and operated his kennel until 1950, by which point the two Siberian breeds had begun to branch out from each other. Perhaps Wheeler’s greatest claim to fame, however, was his role in developing the Mont Tremblant Ski Resort in the Laurentian Mountains of Quebec. After meeting American broadcaster Lowell Thomas at the Olympics, Wheeler convinced Thomas, as well his wealthy business acquaintance Joe Ryan, to travel to Quebec and ascend the mountain. Ryan was so impressed with the view from the top that he invested heavily in the development of the area. Wheeler, meanwhile, was busy helping found a ski school at Gray Rocks and working with the Canadian Ski Instructors’ Alliance to bring about consistent instruction methods across the country. He was inducted into the Canada Ski Hall of Fame as a builder in 1986 and his daughter Lucille was a bronze medalist for Canada in the downhill event at the 1956 Winter Olympics.",Father of Lucile Wheeler

In 1921 he moved to Paris, where he worked as an antique dealer. Inspired by the visit to Paris he returned to Belgium, lived in Namur and studied in Bruxelles, where he resumed working in sculpture. In 1926 he finally moved to Bruxelles. Demanet produced mostly large-scale sculpture showing physical work and powerful movement and, from 1926, more than 100 medals for public and private patrons, and exhibited internationally. One of his most famous sculptures is the statue of the Belgian King Leopold II in Namur. In 1937, Demanet was appointed Knight, and in 1961 Officer, of the Leopold Order and in 1947 Knight of the Legion of Honor. He regularly participated in the Salon des Artistes Français, of which he was a member. Demanet entered three Olympic Games, those of 1924, 1932, and 1936. The Invocation of the Athlete was first exhibited in 1923 in the Salon des Artistes. The dimensions of the bronze sculpture are given as 34 x 185 x 205 cm. Two sculptures were designed just prior to the 1932 Olympics. One 65 cm high and 80 cm long bronze from 1930 is also referred to as Hercules as an archer. Another nearly 60 cm high Archer from 1932 carries an ivory bow in some copies and seems to be more likely his Olympic entry Tir à la perche (Perch shooting). In the same year, Demanet also submitted the medal _ Prix Piccard-Kipfer_. The 75 x 53 mm size bronze plaque, partially silvered, was issued on the occasion of the ascent of Auguste Piccard and Paul Kipfer with a balloon into the stratosphere on 27 May 1931. The back of the plaque bears a respective inscription. The 62 x 50 mm bronze plaque Tireur à la Perche (Perch shooting) dates back to 1935 and shows a fragmentary image of the sculpture Archer from 1932. The plaque Tir à la Carabine (Rifle shooting) in the original 51 x 69 mm format dates from the same year and is also made of bronze, partly silver plated.",

Later he taught in Chicago and New York after having lived in Venezia for two years. In New York he opened his first studio. Johansen’s portraits included many well-known and high-ranked politicians in the US. In 1919, back in Paris, he also painted the signing of the Treaty of Versailles, ordered by the US Congress. He combined luministic, tonalistic, and impressionistic styles and specialized in landscapes, portraits, and interior scenes. His son John M. Johansen was to become one of America’s most famous architects. In 1932 he could only compete “hors concours” because he was also a member of the jury for the art genre of painting. No picture of his painting Land of the Hunters could be found.

Despite losing in the 1924 ABA final, McKenzie went to the Paris Olympics and returned home with the flyweight silver medal after losing the final to the future American world champion Fidel LaBarba.

At the Games he received a bye in the first round and defeated Mohamed Siluvangi of Zaire in the second.

He won both sprints at the 1991 European Junior Championships and was only denied the same double at the 1992 World Juniors by the future superstar Ato Boldon. Unlike Boldon, his career was arrested by injuries and, disillusioned by this and an attempt by a fellow athlete to interest him in a drug programme, he walked away from the sport at the age of 21. For three years he followed a career as a footballer and played for a succession of semi-professional in the lower leagues of English football and also in the League of Wales. He resumed his athletics career in 1995 and within 18 months earned a place in the sprint relay at the Atlanta Olympics. Although he never broke 10 seconds in his career, Campbell tended to excel at major championships. He won the European Championship 100 metres in 1998 and placed second, after the disqualification of Dwain Chambers for drug taking, four years later. On both occasions he was a member of the winning relay team although the 1992 gold was stripped due to Chambers’ involvement with BALCO and he also added a further gold in 2006. He also won two Commonwealth Games relay titles and an individual bronze in 2002. At the global level he won four medals at the World Championships, 2 silvers and a bronze in relays and a bronze in the 100 metres in 2003. Moving on from the disappointment of Atlanta his Olympic fortunes improved in 2000 and 2004. After reaching the final of the 100 at Sydney, Campbell produced a career best performance and led the 200 final until he was overtaken by Kostas Kenteris close to the line. His individual performances in Athens did not match this level but he had the huge satisfaction of being part of the first British team to win the Olympic 4×100 m for 92 years. He left athletics in 2006 and splits his time between a career in the media and as a specialist sprint coach for a number of football and rugby clubs.

By 1931 he was competing in larger races in Canada and the United States, including a 9th place finish in the 1932 Boston Marathon, but was still receiving little attention from the public overall. It was therefore claimed at the time that he “came out of nowhere” to win the 1932 Canadian Marathon Championships in Winnipeg, Manitoba, defeating reigning champion Percy Wyer, who had competed for Canada at the 1928 Summer Olympics and would do so again in 1936. Cudworth’s victory qualified him to help represent Canada at the 1932 edition of the Summer Games, where he placed 18th in a field of 28 competitors in the marathon. He competed in the Boston Marathon again in 1933, but his career began to slow down after this and effectively ended upon his marriage to sprinter Isabella Evans in 1936. Outside of athletics he worked as a baker for his entire life and rarely spoke of his running career. Personal Best: Mar – 2-52:11 (1932).",

46028,Graham Smith,Male,9 May 1958,,, Canada,CAN,"In the late 1970s Graham Smith was arguably Canada’s greatest swimmer on the international scene. He joined the national team in 1973 and first made his mark at the 1976 Summer Olympics, where he won a silver medal in the 4x100 metre medley relay, alongside Clay Evans, Gary MacDonald, Steve Pickell, and Bruce Robertson. He also finished fourth in the 100 and 200 metre breaststroke events and fifth in the 400 metre individual medley. His next feat was to lower the world record in the 200 metre individual medley to 2:05.31 in August 1977, which was later bettered by Oleksandr Sydorenko of the Soviet Union in July 1978, and again by Steve Lundquist of the United States less than a month later. Smith would better Lundquist’s mark just over three weeks later, to 2:03.56, while winning gold in the event at the 1978 World Championships, a tournament at which he also captured silver in the 100 metre breaststroke. Before that, however, Smith had a more important stop, the 1978 Commonwealth Games, where he won a record six gold medals: the 100 and 200 m breaststroke, the 200 and 400 m individual medleys, and the 4x100 m freestyle and medley relays (the former with MacDonald, Bill Sawchuk, and Peter Szmidt and the latter with Sawchuk and the non-Olympians Jay Tapp and Dan Thompson). He accomplished all of this in Edmonton’s Donald Smith Pool, named after his father who died in 1976, shortly after the younger Smith’s appearance at the Olympics. For his achievements that year he received the Lionel Conacher Award and the Lou Marsh Trophy as Canada’s top male and overall athlete respectively. Smith entered the University of California, Berkeley after the Games and won gold at the 1977 Summer Universiade in the 100 and 200 m breaststroke events. His final major international tournament was the 1979 Pan American Games, where he earned silver in the 4x100 m medley relay (alongside Pickell, Sawchuk, and Thompson) and the 200 m individual medley (behind Jesse Vassallo of the United States, who broke Smith’s world record in the process) and bronze in the 100 m breaststroke. After skipping a year of school to train for the 1980 Summer Olympics, he was denied a chance to participate by Canada’s boycott of those Games. He retired from active competition in 1982 and worked as a coach for several years before obtaining an MBA from St. Mary’s College of California. As of 2013 he owns a consulting firm in British Columbia. He was inducted into Canada’s Sports and the Canadian Aquatic Halls of Fame in 1986.","Brother of George Smith Brother of Becky Smith Brother of Susan Smith Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the Summer Pan American Games (0–2–1 1979 San Juan SWI silver: 200 m medley and 4×100 m medley relay, bronze: 100 m breaststroke) Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the Summer Universiade (2–1–0 1977 Sofia SWI gold: 100 m breaststroke and 200 m breaststroke, silver: 4×100 m medley relay) Listed in Olympians Who Set a World Record in Long Course Swimming (200 m medley – 4 August 1977 - 9 July 1978 and 24 August 1978 - 6 July 1979: 2:05.31 (4 August 1977; Montréal, CAN), 2:03.56 (24 August 1978; West-Berlin, FRG)) Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the World Aquatics Championships (1–1–0 1978 West Berlin SWI gold: 200 m medley, silver: 100 m breaststroke) Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the British Empire/Commonwealth Games (6–0–0 1978 Edmonton SWI gold: 100 m breaststroke, 200 m breaststroke, 200 m medley, 400 m medley, 4×100 m freestyle, and 4×100 m medley)"

Birch-Lindgren studied at technical and art universities in Stockholm before he started working as an architect in 1915. He followed his father as architect of the penitentiary directorate. In 1949, he established an architects’ office together with Rudolf Holmgren. He was known for his designs for hospital and prison buildings. Birch-Lindgren also built the first motel in Sweden. His architecture is distinctively functionalistic and expedient. As an expert, he also got involved in planning hospitals in Liberia, Korea, Libya, Kuwait and Lebanon. Birch-Lindgren and Holmberg were also leading architects for building crematories. He promoted winter sports, was on the board of the Swedish Ski Association, designed ski huts, and was a pioneer of Sweden’s Igloo movement. Additionally, he published a number of textbooks. His father Gustaf Lindgren was also an architect. The first ski jumping facility on Fiskartorpet north of Stockholm was built at the end of the 19th century. The ski jump built by Birch-Lindgren around 1930 is still standing, but was not used after 1982. Carl Florman’s ski lodge was built in 1932 at Ullsjö north of Åre. Here, actress Greta Garbo often spent time between film shootings. The ski huts in Storlien, designed by Birch-Lindgren, were built in 1932 for the later king Gustav VI Adolf as a wedding present, as well as for the director E. Bolinder. The submitted Olympic drawings are probably preliminary studies for these projects. “Högfjällsgården” – today “Danske (gården)” – is a hut from 1928 near the Högfjälls ski hotel, whose first designs were also from Birch-Lindgren. “Rämstugan” or “Rämshyttan” is a hut in the province of Dalarna.

At the 1936 Berlin Olympics, he was also entered in the 10,000 m, which was contested on the first day of the athletics competition. But Wang decided not to start, but rather to concentrate on the marathon. Although he fell behind early in the race and finished almost one hour behind the winner, Wang did not quit and completed the course. His first international appearance was at the 1934 Far Eastern Games and a major achievement came in 1935, setting a national record in the 3,000 m. In the year of the Olympics in 1936, Wang also broke the record in the 5,000 m with a time of 17:13.4. After World War II, he continued to compete, setting new records in the 5,000 m in 1946 and 1947, to eventually 16:51.0. Allegedly Wang also went to London to take part in the 1948 Olympics, but there is no record of him competing. He was, however, also the tutor of deaf and dumb 1948 Olympian Luo Wenao and accompanied him on his return to China via North America, where they are reported to have competed in long distance runs and marathons. They both went back by boat to Hong Kong, but did not dare to go to Shanghai where the People’s Liberation Army had just taken control. Lou stayed in Hong Kong, but little is known about the fate of Wang Zhenglin. In 1950, he won Hong Kong’s New Year’s Day international long-distance race representing the South China Association.

Herman Altwegg became a naturalized British subject but returned to Switzerland in 1946 when the Cotton Exchange was nationalized. Jeannette first began ice skating when she was eight years old but she was also an excellent lawn tennis player – in 1947 she was runner-up in the British Junior Championships at Wimbledon. But after winning the British figure skating title and finishing fifth in the World Championships in 1947, she gave up tennis to concentrate exclusively on skating. A bronze medal in the Olympics and fourth and fifth places respectively in the European and world championships in 1948 were an indication that she was making satisfactory progress towards her goal of being the best skater in the world. In the years leading up to the 1952 Olympics, progress was maintained and each season saw Altwegg improve on the previous year’s results. In 1949, she finished third in both the European and world championships; in 1950 she improved to finish second in both championships and in 1951 she won the European title in Zurich and the world crown in Milan. In Olympic year, Altwegg retained her European title in Vienna three weeks before the Games and she went to Oslo in 1952 as the reigning world and European champion. There she established a substantial lead in the compulsory figures and although she was only the fourth in the free skating, her early advantage was sufficient to give her a narrow victory over Tenley Albright of America, who was to succeed her as Olympic champion in 1956. Immediately after the Olympics, Jeannette Altwegg retired and did not defend her world title the following month. Although she was offered vast sums to turn to professional she preferred to take up a teaching post at a children’s orphanage in Switzerland. She remained with the Pestalozzi Children’s Village for a year, and after being awarded the CBE in 1953 Jeannette married Marc Wirz, a Swiss engineer who was the brother of her friend Susi Wirz, the Swiss skating champion.

68917,Godfrey Brown,Male,21 February 1915,183.0,70, Great Britain,GBR,"Twenty-one-year-old Godfrey Brown was the youngest member of the British 4×400 metres relay team at the 1936 Olympics. Despite his youth he was given the responsibility of running the testing anchor stage but he had already shown that he had the ability and the experience for this formidable task. Brown had been an outstanding athlete at Warwick School and when he went up to Peterhouse College, Cambridge, he was awarded his blue in his freshmen year, gaining the first of his three successive victories in the 440 yards in the match against Oxford. Later in 1935 he set a Fenner’s ground record of 48.1 seconds before making his international debut against Germany in Munich where he finished second to Bill Roberts. Prior to the Berlin Olympics, Brown only ran four serious quarter-miles in 1936, all of which he won, but he had also run 9.7 seconds for 100 years and 1:56.0 seconds for 880 yards; this combination of speed and stamina boded well for his Olympic chances. After running 47.3 seconds in the semi-finals, Brown failed by inches to take the Olympic title but his time of 46.7 seconds was a new European record and one second faster than he had run before the Games began. In the 4×400 metre relay, Freddie Wolff, Godfrey Rampling and Bill Roberts handed Brown a six-metre lead over the American Al Fitch and with a fine run Brown stretch the advantage to 15 metres, breaking the tape in 3:09.0 seconds for another European record. In London, one week after the Olympics, Brown produced an even greater relay leg, when he snatched victory with his last strike for the British Empire in the match against the Americans. Brown’s 440 yard stage was unofficially timed at 45.9 seconds and he made up a three-yard deficit on the Olympic bronze medalist Jimmy LuValle. In 1937, Godfrey Brown brought his personal best for 880 yards down to 1:52.2 seconds in America and later ran a relay leg of 1:51.2 seconds in the match against Germany when he comfortably held off the future world record holder Rudi Harbig. Brown was unbeaten in 1938 and was possibly the world’s leading quarter-miler that year. He was the AAA and European champion (400 m) and could count among his victories a win over the American champion Ray Malott. At the 1938 European Championships he also won the silver medal in the 4×400 metres relay (with Godfrey Brown and the non-Olympians John Barnes and Alfred Baldwin) and the bronze medal in the 4×100 metres relay (with Godfrey Brown, Ernie Page, and the non-Olympian Maurice Scarr). After a strenuous season, Brown only indulged in light training the following winter and this neglect showed when the 1939 track season arrived. Apart from winning the AAA 880 yard title in a modest time, he had an undistinguished season and in the last major race of his career he finished fourth and last in the 400 metres in the match against Germany in Cologne. After the war, he attempted a comeback but met with little success and soon retired completely. Godfrey Brown was the most distinguished member of a notable sporting family. His sister Audrey (later Lady AK Court) was a silver medalist in the relay at the 1936 Olympic Games and his brother Ralph (later Sir RK Brown) won the 1934 AAA 440 yards hurdles title and finished third in the Empire Games later that season.

69227,Frederick Kitching,Male,4 July 1886,,, Great Britain,GBR,"Initially a specialist in the standing jumps, Frederick Kitching became the first British athlete to show any degree of consistency in the javelin. He was the first Briton to exceed 120 ft. (36.58), 130 ft. (39.62), and 140 ft. (42.68). A solicitor by then, Kitching was runner-up in the national standing high jump championship in 1911, and in 1912 won the Olympic trial, also finishing second in the javelin. Surprisingly, it was in the standing long jump that he was selected to represent Great Britain at the 1912 Olympics. Kitching was also a very good running high jumper but it was in the javelin, at Stamford Bridge in May 1914, that he set a new British native record of 143 ft 3 in (43.66). A devout Quaker, Kitching sought exemption from service in World War I, and this was granted on the grounds that he joined the Friends Ambulance Unit (FAU), which he did in 1916. He was sent to France a few months later where he drove an ambulance, and also engaged in farming duties. On 11 August 1918 he was killed following an enemy raid that hit the headquarters of the FAU in Dunkerque.

2000550,Luis Fernandes,Male,27 July 1895,,, Portugal,POR,"Luís Fernandes was a sculptor, designer, painter, and teacher. He attended secondary school in Leiria, where he attracted early attention with his caricatures. In 1914 he went to Lisboa with his friend and colleague, the painter Lino António (1898-1974), to study at the School of Fine Arts. Disappointed by the education there, both transferred to the Academy of Fine Arts in Porto. While António stayed with painting, Fernandes concentrated on sculpturing, and around 1921 he returned to Leiria. His most famous works were monuments to the dead of World War I in Leiria and Coimbra, the bust of 17th century poet Francisco Rodrigues Lobo, and a series of large bas-reliefs for public buildings. As a painter he hardly ever appeared publicly. Fernandes was also a talented violinist and in 1946 became co-founder of the Orfeão de Leiria Conservatory. Because of his political convictions, which could not be reconciled with the Estado Novo of dictator Salazar, Fernandes got into professional problems. Fernandes then worked as a teacher at various industrial schools, including the Industrial and Commercial School in Leiria, becoming director in 1950. He died in a tragic accident in the sea off the Berlengas, a group of islands off the west coast of Portugal. Concerning his Olympic work it is known only that it was created as a bronze sculpture or relief in 1952.",

He competed in 11 pistol events and never won a medal, but he finished in the top eight three times, to earn diplomas. However, Tobar was a legend in South American shooting circles. At the Central American and Caribbean Games, Tobar won 29 medals, which is an all-time record for most medals at those games, in any sport (through 2018). Of the 29, nine were gold medals. At the Pan American Games he won 12 shooting medals, with three golds. The 12 Pan American medals is the most ever by any Colombian athlete and ranks him =7th all-time among shooters at those games. His totals for both events were increased by team events, but remarkable nonetheless. To all this, he added a gold medal in air pistol at the 1990 World Championships. Tobar’s son, Bernardo Julian Tobar Prado, also became a top pistol shooter, competing at the World Championships from 1997-2018. While returning from training one day, Tobar Prado was stopped on a Colombian highway by robbers who brandished pistols at his car, which was a bad career move. Tobar Prado promptly took out his sport pistol and shot both dead.

His talent as a rower was spotted when he was a pupil at the King’s School in Chester and he was drafted in the British junior rowing programme where he was to win medals at successive World Junior Championships. By now a student at Cambridge University, James made his senior international début in 2003 and by the end of the year had won his first World Championships medal, a bronze, as part of the national eight. Despite having seven of the crew continue in the boat for the Athens Olympics they had a disappointing time in Greece and failed to reach the final. He took a year to concentrate on his studies but returned to the sport in 2006 and reached his second world final in the coxless pairs. James returned to the eight as a last minute replacement for an ill team-mate during the 2007 World Championships and helped his crew finish third in the final. His big break came at the beginning of the Olympic year of 2008 when he was chosen to be a member of the number one British boat – the coxless four. After injury and illness had stalled the crew’s progress in the early part of the season they had a spectacular return to form in Beijing and rowed through the Australians to win the Olympic title. He then took an extended break from the sport and only returned to rowing at the start of 2011. By the end of the year he had won his first World Championship gold after returning to the coxless four. He won a second successive Olympic gold medal in 2012 and became the first Welshman since Richard Meade in 1968 and 1972 to win consecutive golds. Following his second Olympic gold medal, Tom was granted the Freedom of Wrexham as he became only the 30th recipient of the honour since it was first made in 1906 and the first individual since 1978 to receive it. James also rowed in four Oxford-Cambridge boat races 2003-07 and, in winning his Olympic title, was the first Welsh Olympic champion in rowing for 76 years. Tom retired in November 2013 to concentrate on his business consultancy career but maintained his connections with the sport as he worked with both the Cambridge University and Molesey Boat Clubs.","Listed in Olympians Who Competed in the Boat Race (2003 Cambridge (won), 2005 Cambridge (lost), 2006 Cambridge (won), 2007 Cambridge (won))"

She continued her streak of silver medals at the national championships through 1974, making two appearances at the World Championships in 1973 and 1974 and finishing 15th both times. 1975 was a pivotal year for Berezowski: in addition to finally capturing a gold medal at the Canadian National Championships, she moved up to 9th at the World Championships and was crowned “Miss Toronto”, an honour that was not unprecedented, as she had twice been voted “Miss Charm on Ice” at the Moscow Invitational Championships. The following year she was once again Canadian National Champion, finished seventh at the World Championships, and competed in the very first ice dancing event at the 1976 Winter Olympics, finishing 10th. She also continued her success as a beauty queen, finishing third runner-up in that year’s “Miss Canada” competition and being named “Miss Olympics” in a German newspaper poll of readers and journalists.

921535,Anna Hyatt Huntington,Female,10 March 1876,,, United States,USA,"Anna Hyatt Huntington mainly produced heroic equestrian statues and specialized in sculptures of animals, especially pets, but also wildlife. As the youngest daughter of a zoologist she developed an early interest in animals, mainly horses. Rather casually, she also painted landscapes. Her mother drew sketches for her husband’s publications and painted landscapes in her leisure time. Nevertheless, Huntington’s first career goal was to be a violinist, until, in 1895, her sister asked her to model a group of dogs. The success of this work encouraged the sisters to work closely together. In 1895 Anna began to study sculpture, first in Boston and then in New York. In 1900 she had her first exhibition in Boston and completed her first major work, two German mastiffs from blue granite. In 1902, she went to New York City and studied under Hermon Atkins MacNeil at the Art Students League. During this time she lived and worked with Abastenia St. Leger Eberle. Together they went to Europe and toured England, Italy and France until 1911. For her equestrian statue of Jeanne d’Arc for the French city of Blois she was honored as a Knight of the Legion d’Honneur. At the age of 47 years, Anna Hyatt married the wealthy philanthropist Archer Milton Huntington. In 1930 he bought a site near the city of Myrtle Beach in South Carolina. There, the couple founded the Brookgreen Sculpture Garden, the first of its kind in the US. In 1932 they moved to Virginia and opened the Mariners’ Museum, today one of the largest maritime museums worldwide. After her husband’s death she continued to work until her death at age 97, although she had developed tuberculosis in 1927. About a dozen copies of the approximately 2.50 m tall bronze statue Diana, actually Diana of the Chase, sculptured in 1922, are in various places, including: Brookgreen Garden, the Huntington Library & Botanical Garden in Pasadena, the Audubon Zoo in New Orleans and the Washington County Museum of Fine Arts in Hagerstown, Maryland.

Walter stood in his brother’s during their lifetime. Both brothers were architects and won the 1936 competition for the construction of the Berlin sports forum. Model, ground plan, and photos were his 1928 entry for the art competitions. Construction began after the Reichstag had paid a first installment of one million RMs. A part of the dormitory for female students and the connecting tunnel were completed. The second phase of construction fell victim to the government’s savings plans. After 1933 the construction of the forum was finalized, although the university was dissolved. In fall 1933, the brothers were awarded the contract to build the Reichssportfeld and the Olympic Stadium for 1936. Walter March worked in the 1920s at times in the US with Frank Lloyd Wright and took US citizenship in 1931. There he worked on numerous buildings in Greater New York. He also designed ceramics, furniture and other wood and metal works. While Walter March went to the US, Werner collaborated with the Nazis and joined the party in 1933.

Nannini was in charge of the squadron (one of eight in total) called Rossa Stellata (Red Star). From Chicago the entire squadron flew to New York with an escort of 36 US planes, where they were given a warm welcome on Broadway as millions of people watched the parade. US President Franklin D. Roosevelt invited General Balbo and all his men to lunch. On 25 July the group returned via Shediac, Shoal Harbour, Ponta Delgada, and Lisboa, landing at the seaplane base of Ostia on 12 August, and ending what The Times described as “the greatest exploit in the history of the Air Force.” During World War II, Nannini was for some years at the Budapest legation and when he was reached by the news of the armistice (8 September 1943), he immediately worked to protect and defend Italian interests, safeguarding thousands of remaining soldiers involved in the events of the armistice.
