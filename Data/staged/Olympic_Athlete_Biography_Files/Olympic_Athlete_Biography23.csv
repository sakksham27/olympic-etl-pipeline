From 1936-40 he was Kapellmeister at the Berlin State Opera Unter den Linden, and until 1945 worked as a freelance composer.

He was a flier, motorist, yachtsman, and was equally at home on the Cresta Run, where he won the Curzon Cup in 1920, 1922 and 1927. He was also a scratch golfer and was described by former British amateur champion Roger Wethered as “the best bad golfer in England.” Brabazon celebrated his 70th birthday in a bobsleigh on the Cresta Run, and at 79, just six months before his death, drove in the London-to-Brighton car race. In addition to his sporting prowess, Brabazon served as a Member of Parliament from 1918-29 and then again from 1932-42, when he entered the House of Lords as Peer. He served in Winston Churchlll’s war-time Cabinet as Minister of Transport (1940-41) and then Minister of Aviation (1941-42). The son of Lieutenant Colonel J. A. H. Moor-Brabazon of Tara Hall, County Meath Ireland, Brabazon’s full title was first Lord Brabazon of Tara of Sandwich in the County of Kent. He was educated at Harrow and then Trinity College, Cambridge and at the end of the 19th century started to indulge in the new pastime of motoring. After leaving college he started racing cars seriously and became an amateur mechanic for his friend Charles Rolls, of Rolls Royce fame. Brabazon’s biggest motor racing success was in winning the 1907 Circuit des Ardennes in a Minerva. At the same time he started experimenting with flying and in December 1908 flew 450 yards in his own machine to become the first Englishman to fly such a distance. Having won various flying trophies, on 2 May 1909 he made history by being the first Briton to carry a passenger aboard a flight in Great Britain, and the following year, 8 March 1910, he had the distinction of receiving the very first pilot’s certificate (No.1) issued by the Royal Aero Club. During World War I it was no surprise that Brabazon served in the Royal Flying Corps (later the RAF), and was awarded the Military Cross and rose to the rank of lieutenant-colonel. After the War, he concentrated on developing aerial photography techniques, and in 1926 built the first truly effective air camera. Over the years, Brabazon held some important posts. He was president of the Royal Aero Club, and between 1946-48 was president of the Fédération Aéronautique Internationale. He was also the one-time Commodore of the House of Lords Yacht Club. However, Brabazon held some important positions in the golfing world. He became a scratch golfer within months of taking up the sport and in 1938 became president of the English Golf Union, a similar post he held with Professional Golfers’ Association (PGA) in 1954. He had the honour of captaining the Royal & Ancient (R&A), but spoke very little about “driving himself into office” at his inauguration, with a drive that was best described as being “lower than anyone expected”. Golf’s Brabazon Trophy, which is presented to the winner of the English Men’s Open Amateur Stroke Play Championship, is named after Brabazon’s son Derek, the second Lord Brabazon of Tara.",Listed in Olympians Who Were Members of National Legislatures (Member of the UK House of Commons 1918-1942 (Conservative))

Finding the sport too repetitive, he then took to diving, but injured himself and then switched to gymnastics. It was in this sport that he was finally chosen to represent Egypt at the 1952 Helsinki Olympics, where he had a best individual finish of joint-105th (with Zdzisław Lesiński of Poland) in the floor exercise and was 16th with the national team. As a student of Political Economy at Cairo University, Reda encountered an Argentine dance troupe, which he was invited to join. This solidified the career path that he would take for the remainder of his life: that of a dancer. After touring Egypt, Rome, and Paris, he worked as an accountant for a short time to save money and then started his own Egyptian folkloric dance troupe, The Reda Troupe, in August 1959.

During the German occupation, he was interned in a concentration camp near Svatobořice. Španiel’s style was based on Art Nouveau and then on Neoclassicism. After World War II, he was an official state artist. Španiel was best known for his frequent medal works illustrating Czech VIPs. One of these medals with the face of J. E. Purkyně became the template for a stamp series in 1937. He designed the first Czech coins after World War II and also created his own grave at the famous Prague cemetery Vyšehrad. Some of his works, mainly gold medals and coins, were presented in the exhibition “Czech Gold” in Prague in 2009-10 at the Czech Club of the Municipal House at Prague. In 1912 he took part under the flag of Bohemia, a part of Austria-Hungary, and in 1936 under that of Czechoslovakia. In 1936 he entered the ČSOV Challenge Award, which bears the name of Bohemian-Czech Olympic pioneer Jiří Guth-Jarkovský.

74144,Arne Halse,Male,20 October 1887,172.0,80, Norway,NOR,"Arne Halse was born in Kristiansund as the son of a ship captain. The family moved to Trondheim in 1901, where his father, Dyre Halse, started a firm in which he imported and sold coal and coke. The firm was a success, and his father became one of the richest men in Trondheim. In 1921 he donated a statue of the founder of the city of Trondheim, the Viking king Olav Tryggvason. The statue is placed on the market place in the city, still a well-known landmark in Trondheim. Early on Arne Halse showed great talent in the throwing events. In 1905, at age 17 as a member of Trondhjems IF, he became Norwegian Champion in javelin and was second in the shot put. From 1905-09 he was national champion four times in the javelin and three times in shot put. At the 1906 Intercalated Games Halse placed seventh in the javelin while still a teenager. In 1908 he moved to Kristiania to study economy, and became a member of IK Tjalve. In May he showed excellent form, throwing the javelin 54.40 m, 25 cm better than the famous Swede Eric Lemming’s best result at the time. At London in 1908 Halse won Norway’s first Olympic medals in athletics, with silver in the javelin and bronze in the freesyle javelin, both events won comfortably by Lemming. After the Olympics, Halse concentrated on his studies, but went to his hometown for the National Championships, winning both the shot put and the javelin. In 1909 Halse moved home to Trondheim to work in his father’s company, but in 1911 he came back with a new club at Brage’s international competition in July, winning the shot put and finishing second in his favorite event, javelin, behind the Swede Hilding Sonne. In 1912 he went to Kristiania in late June to participate in the third and latest selection competition for the Stockholm Olympics. He was in good shape and won the both hands javelin, setting a new national record, and defeating the 1911 national champion, Daniel Johansen, by almost 10 metres. In Stockholm Halse placed seventh in the javelin throw, and three days later concluded his athletic career by finishing fifth in the both hands javelin event, ending his career by setting an all-time personal best of 55.05 with his best-hand throw. Halse retired from athletics at age 24. He married, and from 1913-18 became the father of four children, one boy and three girls. He continued to work for his father’s firm. During the 1920s his father retired, and Arne became the manager, but he was still interested in sport.

113074,Sharon Laws,Female,7 July 1974,164.0,54, Great Britain,GBR,"Born in Kenya to British parents, Sharon Laws took a long and unusual route to being a professional cyclist and eventually an Olympian. Though she was a county level hockey player as a schoolgirl, Laws concentrated on her studies and earned a degree in biology from Nottingham University. After a period doing volunteer work in East Africa, she returned to the UK to complete a master’s degree in conservation at University College London, after which she was offered a job as an environmental advisor with the Civil Service. Her first cycle race came when she was already 27 and was mainly as training for more gruelling, multi-discipline “Adventure races” in which she successfully competed while posted to South Africa. After a return to the UK and growing success in endurance mountain bike races, a new job with the Rio Tinto Corporation then took her to Australia in late 2006. By the end of the following year she was making regular visits to the podium in minor Australian races but it still came as a shock when she made a huge breakthrough by placing 2nd in the Australian National Championships at the start of 2008 sandwiched between Oenone Wood and Olympic champion Sara Carrigan. This display earned her a contract with the Team Halfords professional team and a sabbatical from her job. Laws then won the British national time trial championships in early summer to clinch a place at the Beijing Olympics. Her story garnered enough publicity for the BBC to shoot a segment for their Olympic preview programme but she hit a pothole whilst filming and suffered a broken fibula just six weeks before the Games began. She recovered in time to compete but her supporting role to Nicole Cooke was compromised when she was twice brought down by accidents taking place in front of her and finished 35th. Despite being a late starter she had a ten year pro career which was highlighted by a win at the 2012 British Road Race Championships. After struggling through the 2016 season she retired in August of that year and only two months later was diagnosed with stage IV cervical cancer. She received chemotherapy and was well enough to join the commentary team for the TV coverage of the women’s Tour of Britain in summer 2017 before succumbing to the disease just before Christmas of the same year.",

It was here that Schöpf renewed his passion for skiing and won titles in the downhill, slalom, and combined at the 1947 University World Championships. That same year, he won the first of three consecutive Austrian national titles in the slalom, adding a combined victory in 1948 and finally clinching all three disciplines in 1949 by winning the downhill as well. In between, Schöpf represented his country at the 1948 St. Moritz Olympics, where he was fifth in the downhill and sixth in the slalom. Schöpf won his only major international medal at the 1950 World Championships, where he was third in the downhill behind Zeno Colò of Italy and James Couttet of France. Schöpf was also fifth in the slalom and 20th in the giant slalom. He retired from active competition after this tournament, but made a brief comeback in 1952 in time to represent Austria at that year’s Olympics in Oslo. He failed to complete either the downhill or the giant slalom, and then retired for good. In addition to his career as an alpine skier, Schöpf was also active as a handball player from the late 1940s and had a few appearances on the Austrian national team. In the mid-1950s he also became a rally driver. In 1960 he became race supervisor for the Kneissl ski company and worked with successful skiers such as Karl Schranz, Heinrich Messner, Leonhard Stock and Marc Girardelli.

Despite this he finished sixth in the race, at that time the second best finish by an American in an Olympic downhill (Bill Beck had finished fifth in 1952). Mill skied the World Cup circuit from 1974-81 with seven top 10 finishes, all in downhill or combined. He then began a career in the ski industry, working as a ski racing commentator on television, and with a syndicated show that is shown in many of the major US ski areas, called “Ski with Andy Mill.” Mill later took up tarpon fishing and became quite good at that sport as well. He won five Gold Cup tarpon tournaments and won the Triple Crown of tarpon fishing, winning the Gold Cup, Hawley, and Golden Fly events. In addition to his work on television for skiing, he has hosted an outdoor fishing show on the OLN Network (later Versus).

His early Irish mythological subjects reflected the influence of Jack Yeats and are part of the poetic imagery of the search for national identity. Oliver’s father Simpson Sheppard was also a sculptor. He is best known for his bronze sculpture idealizing the Irish struggle for independence. The Death of Cuchulainn is considered Sheppard’s masterpiece and an important work of Irish art. It is a bronze figure of the mythological warrior-hero Cuchulainn, who continued to fight against his enemies while gravely wounded and tied to a tree. Sheppard was important as an Irish Protestant who supported Irish independence, beginning as a student in the 1880s when he joined the Irish Parliamentary Party. He created at least two sculptures bearing the title of his entry, The Bather. Dating from 1915 and 1934, both were presented at the respective Royal Hibernian Academy’s annual exhibition.",

They built secret bunkers and provided them with food from the store. Unfortunately, someone found out and complained to the Germans and brought Jószef in for questioning.

He was a prolific Danish sculptor who is remembered for his figures of sportsmen and his statues of famous Danes. Nellemose attended a drawing school and the art academy from 1927-33. He began his career as a cartoonist and sports journalist. A scholarship enabled him to travel to Italy, Greece, Turkey, France and the UK in the late 1940s. As a sculptor, he was known for his naturalistic human figures and portrait busts, often in motion, and sculpted numerous athletes, often with strong emotion, both in small and large formats, mostly in stone and bronze. During World War II, Nellemose was a member of the Danish resistance group. Therefore, he later received many commissions for war memorials. He also used photographs as templates to represent prisoners from concentration camps in his sculptures. In 1965, he became a teacher at the Art Academy in Århus. The Thorvaldsen Medal, awarded in 1968, was one of his numerous honors. His sister, Karin (1905–93) was a well-known actress, figuring in many stage productions and films. In the 1930s he was married to painter Rita Elena Goltermann Hansen (married Nellemose and Baunsgaard, 1910-1985) from Argentina. The bronze Ung mand med diskos (Young Man with Discus) from 1942 is 280 cm high together with its granite base. Nellemose received the Eckersberg Medal for this work in 1944. It was erected in 1949 at the Vejle Stadium in Copenhagen. The first version of the Bokserhovede (Head of a Boxer) was created in 1934 and was presented in 1948 in the granite version (1947). The height of this sculpture, which is located in the Stockholm National Museum, is 42 cm. It is remarkable that he received the Honorable Mention for both, Young Man with Discus and Head of a Boxer. The bronze To Brydere or Brydere i kamp (in the art catalog as Group of Wrestlers) is 76 cm high and dates from 1938. It was a preparatory work for a larger-than-life group that Nellemose exhibited, but destroyed shortly afterwards. The original of the life-size bronze Fodboldspillere (Football Players, also called Tacklingen) from 1941 is displayed in the Trapholt Museum in Kolding. Until the 1980s, only slightly revised versions of this work were set up at different locations in Denmark. Denmark’s “Football Player of the Year” also receives a copy of the sculpture.",

In truth his first Olympic experience was underwhelming as he failed to finish the 18 km cross-country skiing event and was a lowly 23rd of 25 in the ski jumping portion of Nordic combination. From then on his career as a javelin thrower took precedence and he won the first of his five national titles in 1925.

He bettered the record again in 1926 in Wengen and ultimately in 1927 in Nový Svet to 42.5 m. He even jumped 66 m in Pontresina but did not land properly and, therefore, the record was not approved. At the 1928 Winter Olympics, he was handicapped by a shoulder injury but still managed to become the best of the Polish jumpers. With his first jump of 58 m he set yet another Polish record, which only lasted weeks until he jumped 63 m. At his two World Championships he placed 13th in the jumping in 1927 and two years later in his hometown Zakopane 21st in Nordic combined and 38th in jumping. After the actual competition, he jumped 66 m setting his last national record. After his competitive career, he appeared in two mountain movies by director Adam Krzeptowskiego and took care of his farm and carpenter’s workshop.

In his early years he paired with his sister Meghan to compete in ice dancing tournaments. As a singles competitor he first drew attention in 1998 when he was the runner up in the Canada Junior Figure Skating Championship. His next three years were rocky, placing 10th, 6th and 9th at the senior level of the competition and 7th at the World Junior Championships. He finally reached the podium in 2002, with a bronze medal at the Canadian Championships, but was selected only as an alternate for the 2002 Winter Olympics and that year’s national runner-up Emanuel Sandhu pulled out too late to be replaced by Buttle. The latter competed at the 2002 World Championships and placed 8th, and then took silver at the 2003 Canadian Championships. He slid to 15th at that year’s World Championship and in 2004 won another bronze medal at the Canadian Championships. Buttle had his landmark year in 2005 when he won the first of three consecutive Canadian Championships and was runner-up at the World Championships. He made it to the 2006 Winter Olympics and won a bronze medal in the singles tournament, but placed 6th in the 2006 World Championships and again in 2007. In 2008 he slid to runner up position at the Canadian Championship, but pulled off an amazing program at that year’s World Championships to take home the gold. Declaring that his motivation to compete had ended, he retired in September of that year. He had skated with Stars on Ice for the final three years of his amateur career and began touring with Smuckers Stars on Ice in 2009.

Simmons later had a moderately successful decade as a film actor and stuntman, first with Universal and then with MGM. He played in the 1958 musical “South Pacific,” and after the movie, briefly lived in Tahiti. One of his close friends in his early Hollywood days was another aspiring actor, Clint Eastwood, of whom he noted that they “jogged and surfed together and spent a lot time displaying our sunglasses, like movie stars.” Simmons fought in World War II with the 10th Mountain Division, earning a Purple Heart, serving in Italy. He later became a professional artist and photographer, settling in his native Charlotte. Chunk’s nickname came from his youth, when his mother called him her “little chunk of love.” Personal Bests: 120yH – 14.4 (1951); Dec – 6945 (1952).",Listed in Olympians Who Acted in Movies (20 credits on IMDb from 1956-63; notably as Commander Harbison in South Pacific)

Educated at a Free School Community in Thuringia he started composing in 1909. But he started studying Chemistry in Switzerland, where he attended the notorious premiere of [Igor Strawinsky’s]’s Sacre Du Printemps. When his father’s company burned down in 1914, he had to take up a teaching job. At the end of World War I, Kool started his musical studies in Berlin, but later also went to Munich and Paris. He then frequently collaborated with expressionist female dancer Grit Hegesa and led a jazz orchestra, he himself playing the saxophone. His growing fame resulted in the Berlin Philharmonic performing his Workers’ Symphony. In 1924, he travelled to the US together with dancer Leni Riefenstahl, later director of the films about the 1936 Olympics. From 1923-25, Kool was the artistic director of the newly founded Vox record company. He wrote the music for films, ballets, theater productions, etc. After he lost a fortune on Black Friday in 1929, he returned to his former boarding school as a teacher and for some years as a headmaster. In 1931, Kool published his standard work The Saxophone and one year later married the Silesian dancer Vlasta Hajek, 19 years his junior. He returned to Amsterdam for some time but was called back to his German school. Although his previous work was considered “Degenerate Art” in Nazi Germany, he impressed the culture officers with a new composition based on paintings by Pieter Breughel. But after the occupation of the Netherlands, he was arrested and expelled to his home country. Nevertheless, he was initially commissioned by Hitler’s local governor. After World War II, Kool moved to Thuringia again, trying to resume his school teaching. But he ended up as a bar musician, owner of a music shop, and timber merchant in the Netherlands. His music was largely forgotten. His work submitted in 1924 is not mentioned. One of the likely candidates is his dance pantomime Die Schießbude (The shooting gallery) completed in 1922.

As a 16-year-old youth, he upset the French épée fencers at the 1900 Paris Olympics, winning the amateur event. He also fought in the competition that faced the best amateurs against the best masters, in which he ranked second behind Albert Ayat. These were the first Cuban and first Latin American medals in Olympic history. He added to his collection at the 1904 Games in St. Louis, winning both the foil and épée events and joining American Albertson Van Zo Post and fellow Cuban Manuel Díaz to win the foil team competition. For 20 years, Fonst disappeared from the Olympic stage, but he did not stop competing, fencing in events over the world. When the first formal Cuban team entered the Olympics in 1924, Fonst was again an Olympian, albeit without a medal. His career was still far from over, as Fonst dominated the fencing competitions at the 1926 and 1930 Central American and Caribbean Games, winning five golds. In 1938, at the age of 55, he returned to these Games and won a sixth gold - his last major victory. As a pun on his matronymic which was Segundo, Fonst’s nickname was El nunca Segundo, roughly meaning “He who never comes in second”. Fonst continued to be involved in sports, serving as the president of the Cuban NOC (1941-46) and as a government advisor on physical education.","Listed in Olympic Fencers - Winning Gold Medals, Foil/Épée (1900 Épée, Individual; 1904 Épée, Individual; 1904 Foil, Individual; 1904 Foil, Team.)

Additionally, an uncle, great-uncle and three cousins also won it. The first victor from the family in 1860 was “Honest” John Phelps, who was the finishing judge on the only occasion the Boat Race ended in a dead-heat, in 1877, when he famously declared the result as: “A dead-heat for Oxford by five yards.” Dick Phelps was employed as a boat builder by his uncle “Bossie” Phelps, and, apart from a brief spell in in the Royal Navy during World War I, he remained in that profession until 1931, when he became boatman at The Thames Rowing Club. He remained with them for 35 years until 1966. In his second year with TRC, 1932, he helped them win the Stewards’ Cup at Henley and was also a reserve for the gold medal-winning coxless fours at the Los Angeles Olympics that year. He was one of two reserves and when Tom Tyler pulled out at the last minute, Phelps lost out because the seat went to “Jumbo” Edwards. Phelps attended the 1936 and 1948 Olympics as boatman, and also went to the 1954 and 1958 British Empire and Commonwealth Games, and the 1959 European Championships, in a similar capacity. He had the honour of being appointed by Royal Warrant, the Queen’s Waterman in 1953. When he retired from the Thames Rowing Club in 1966 he was made an honorary life member. Dick’s brother Tom was boatman to the London Rowing Club for many years, and in 1969 was the lone figure standing on the barge that carried Sir Winston Churchill’s body up the Thames during his State Funeral.

97942,Tamás Sudár,Male,13 July 1941,,, Hungary,HUN,"Tamás Sudár started skiing at the age of 7 and joined the ski jumping team of Bp. Honvéd at the age of 11. He became a Hungarian champion twice as a youth (1958, 1960) and was a three-time national champion silver medalist as a senior (1959, 1961, 1963) and a member of the championship team twice (1963, 1965). Yet he was most proud that he was the first Hungarian jumper to jump 80 metres and was chosen for the 1960 Winter Olympics for this performance. No one could accompany the 18-year-old to the Squaw Valley Olympics, so he had to prepare for the competition alone for three weeks, which piqued the interest of Tony Curtis and Life Magazine. The American filmstar, who was of Hungarian descent, spent a day in Squaw Valley and wanted to meet Hungarian athletes. Life Magazine was also curious about the special situation of a Hungarian boy and his meeting with Tony Curtis, and thus, Tamás Sudár, who finished only 41st in the ski jumping competition, ended up on the cover of Life Magazine on 29 February 1960. After his sports career in 1967, Sudár worked as a coach for a few years. In 1968, as a coach at the Grenoble Winter Olympics, he helped the best Hungarian ski jumper of all-time, László Gellér, to a 19th place finish with the best Hungarian result to date. Sudár was an iron turner as a profession, but later became a grinder and tool maker. Eventually, he was a team leader at a German telecommunications company.",

Katz first competed at the Finnish championships in 1922, finishing fourth in the 3,000 metre steeplechase, and soon rose to be the world’s leading steeplechaser in the mid-1920s. Katz won steeplechase Olympic silver in 1924, behind legendary Ville Ritola and then joined with him and Paavo Nurmi to win gold in the 3,000 m team race. Katz was Finnish steeplechase champion in 1923-24 and 1926; 5,000 m champion in 1924; and 4x1,500 m relay champion in 1926. In 1926, he ran on two world record setting relay teams, when he was a member of the Finnish 4x1,500 m relay team that ran 16:26.2 in July 1926 and then lowered the mark to 16:11.4 later that year. In 1925, Bar Kochba of Berlin, the first Jewish national sports club in Central Europe, founded in 1898, invited Katz to represent the club. He did, but then returned to his native Finland in 1927 to prepare for the 1928 Olympic Games; however, a severe foot injury ended his chances of competing in Amsterdam and Katz returned to Germany and Bar Kochba as a coach. In 1933 Katz emigrated to Palestine and was selected to coach the Israeli Olympic track team for the 1948 Games in London. Neither he nor the Israeli team ever made it to England, as Israel was not admitted into the Olympic family until 1952, and Katz was murdered by Arab terrorists in December 1947, while working as a film projectionist at a British Army camp near Gaza.

Russell then represented Great Britain in the match against the United States at Wembley and beat Joe Wall. After the match, Russell was offered a large sum of money to turn professional but remained in the amateur ranks.

In 1938 she worked as a bookkeeper at a chemical plant in Zgierz and married Franciszek Grętkiewicz. During the German occupation, she was imprisoned with her husband after the uprising in the Warszawa Ghetto. After the 1944 Warszawa Uprising they returned permanently to the small town of Pabianic. After her first husband died in 1945 she married Tadeusz Marcinkiewicz, who later died in 1964. After World War II Jadwiga Wajs worked again as a bookkeeper for a textile company in Łódź and also became a coach, professionally since 1950, in local sports clubs. In the 1960s she was employed to care for abandoned and disabled children. She had an interest in sports since her early age, joining the local sport club when only 8-years-old, and making her international début in 1931. Prior to the Los Angeles Games she took the world record in the discus from 1928 gold medalist Halina Konopacka, becoming the first woman to better 40 metres. Her bronze medal was surely a disappointment, and in a meet in Chicago just after the Games she threw 41.08 m, which would have been enough for the gold medal. Wajs won the discus at the 1934 Women’s World Games, and during the next few years bettered the world record four more times, losing the record in 1935 to the eventual 1936 Olympic champion, German Gisela Mauermayer. Wajs set her last of nine national records while winning the silver medal in Berlin. She also set three national records in the shot put. Her versatility is also shown by the fact that she qualified to represent Poland in 1936 in gymnastics, but did not compete. After the war, she took up competing again, winning the Polish Championship in the discus and shot in September 1945. After her second marriage she won a bronze medal in the discus and finished fourth in shot put at the 1946 European Championships as Jadwiga Wajs-Marcinkiewicz. At times she also adopted the German name Weiß. Between 1932 and 1948 she won 21 Polish titles in four different disciplines despite the forced break during World War II.

He stayed in captivity in Germany until his release in 1918. Shortly afterwards, however, Horrocks was back fighting again, this time against the Bolsheviks in Russia. He was subsequently injured in action, which resulted in him receiving a Military Cross. In between the two World Wars, Horrocks enjoyed several military staff appointments. He also found time to compete in the modern pentathlon at the 1924 Paris Olympics. He returned to active service in 1939 and commanded his own regiment until 1942 when General Montgomery called him to command the 13th Corps of “Monty’s” 8th Army in the Western Desert. Towards the end of the war, Horrocks was seriously wounded and was hospitalised for many months in. He never fully recovered and, despite returning to action, eventually succumbed to his injuries and was invalided out of the Army in January 1949 with the rank of lieutenant-general. He was then appointed Gentleman Usher of Black Rod in the House of Lords (known simply as Back Rod). Horrocks held the post, which was inaugurated in the 14th century, for 14 years until June 1963. Needing more in his life, Horrocks started writing articles and stories on military matters for newspapers and magazines, and later became a television personality talking on the same subject.

Initially training with the Soviet skaters, she was refused when she became a threat to them. The GDR government allowed the Haases to move to the Swedish town of Kiruna, where they could train.

During that time his name was suggested by Frank Selke, then general manager of the Montreal Canadiens, as a possible candidate to join the Canadian delegation to the 1948 Winter Olympics as a defenseman. When officially invited by Sidney Dawes, then president of the Canadian Amateur Hockey Association, he accepted, and was immediately instated as a private in the Royal Canadian Air Force so that he could be a member of their team, the Flyers. He played in eight games in the tournament, scoring one goal in a 15-0 shutout against Poland. In the final eight seconds of the match against Sweden he acted as a goalkeeper when Murray Dowey was given a penalty. The Canadian team took the gold medal and Laperriere returned to the University of Montreal, despite an offer to play with the New York Rangers. He finished his degree and retired from active play after the 1949-1950 season, after winning the Canadian Intercollegiate Hockey Union championship in his final two years.

The year after taking up the sport, he made his début at Bisley, and in 1949 won the Silver Pheasant Challenge Trophy at the annual Gamekeeper’s Clay Pigeon Tournament. He made his England début that same year, and also won his first major championship, the English Open Skeet Championship. Over the next six years he won more than 60 titles, and was the first shooter in England to score 100 straight hits with a single barrel. Wheater was runner-up in the English Open Skeet Championship in 1950, and was the English Open Clay Pigeon Champion in 1951, 1955, and 1956. Having appeared in the first of three Olympics in 1956, he set a world record the following year breaking 1,308 clays in an hour, beating the old record set by J. H. Crang of Toronto. Wheater was the individual European trap champion in 1959, when he also won a team bronze. By the time of the 1960 Olympics, Wheater had moved from being a gamekeeper to working for a Hull gunmaker, and it was a memorable year for him. He was runner-up in both the British Skeet Championship and the Grand Prix of Great Britain at Chester, which was won by three-time Formula One World Champion Jackie Stewart. That year, 1960, Wheater also won an individual trap bronze, and team silver, at the European Championships, and became the first English All-Round Champion, making him one of the favourites for a medal at the Rome Olympics. He was lying joint third after the first round of the final, but was not feeling at his best and was suffering from a severe lack of sleep in the Olympic Village, which he blamed on: “The equestrian people clattering down the hall, ‘horses and all’, at five and six in the morning” – that was typical of Wheater, a straight-talking Yorkshireman who was not one of the traditional “shooting set” of that era. He eventually finished in sixth place in the Roma final. Wheater won a fifth European medal in 1961, a team silver, and in 1964 won his sixth British Open Clay Pigeon Championship. He was honoured with the captaincy of the British clay pigeon team at his third Olympics, in Tokyo. In 1968, he was the coach of the Irish Olympic shooting team in Mexico City. He went on to win two more British Open titles, in 1971–72.

The cover of issue 12 from August 1936 shows a hand with a laurel wreath, an antique Hoplitodromos runner, and Doric columns. According to the imprint, the color offset print in the format 36.8 x 26.7 cm was made by Hans Ferdinand and Hein Neuner. Neuner studied at the Städelschule in Frankfurt and later at the Frankfurt Academy. In 1943 he had to leave Berlin, as his home was bombed out, and returned to his parents in Aschaffenburg. In 1946 he turned back to free artistic creations in the old mill stream near the village of Obernaus. In 1949 Neuner joined the faculty of the National School of Arts and Crafts in Saarbrücken, where he and his wife Eve (1914-1979) became members of the “New Saar Group.” In 1953, Neuner was named professor at the Stuttgart Academy of Fine Arts and was a successful teacher until his retirement in 1969.

He studied wood carving, sculpturing and painting under the leading local artists of the time. He preferred to work with the local Molave wood. His famous works included the figure of San Francisco in Quiapo Church and the bust of Jose Rizal done in bronze relief. In addition to this, he produced realistic polychrome figures of peasant types, such as a woman holding a clay pot, and a grey-haired man proudly holding a rooster. Animal subjects also fascinated Nepomuceno, and one of his best known sculptures portrayed a man grappling, and subduing, a crocodile. Nepomuceno also created the ceiling reliefs in Malacañang Palace, the official residence of the President of the Philippines. He also transposed famous paintings, such as Leonardo da Vinci’s “Last Supper”, into carved reliefs, mainly working with the local Molave wood. The work submitted to the 1948 Olympic art competitions was a wooden sculpture of a boy playing sipa, a popular local game played with a rattan ball. The sculpture is now kept in the magazine of the National Museum in Manila.",

Shortly afterwards, Turner won the Southern Counties springboard title and was called up for his international début against Germany. In 1951 Turner dethroned Heatly as national 3-metre champion and, after winning an Olympic qualifying competition, Turner was selected for the 1952 Olympics. He went to the Helsinki Games as the first Englishman to win all three titles (Platform, and 1- and 3-metre springboard) in one year. At the Olympics he finished seventh in the springboard event and 19th in the platform. A month after the Olympics, Turner finished seventh, again, in the springboard event at the European Championships in Milano. Turner, a joiner’s apprentice, retained his three national titles in 1953 and that year was called up for two year’s National Service. He served with the Royal Air Force (RAF) School of Physical Training, and in his first year helped the RAF win the Inter-Services Diving Championships. Turner retained all three national titles for a third consecutive year in 1954 and then went to Vancouver to represent England at British Empire and Commonwealth Games in Vancouver. He finished fifth in the platform event but won the springboard silver medal behind Scotland’s Peter Heatly. In 1955 Turner won a scholarship to the University of Michigan and, when the ASA published one of their early lists of competitors for the 1956 Melbourne Olympics, Turner along with the swimming Wardrop twins Bert and Jack were all at Michigan. Only Jack, however, made the trip to Australia. After moving to the United States, Turner helped the University of Michigan swimming and diving team win three consecutive NCAA titles, and was named an All-American. He then went on to become the swimming and diving coach at Riverside City College, California, and served them for 30 years (1964-93).

In the following year, he won the Japanese Championships in the marathon and qualified for the Amsterdam Olympics. In the Olympic race he had a comfortable lead at the 40 km mark when a knee injury that he acquired during training in Berlin flared up, and he had to let three runners pass him, eventually finishing fourth. Nevertheless, his time of 2-35:29 was a Japanese best on an official marathon course at the time. After the Olympics, he took first place in the 400 miles ultra-race from Osaka to Tokyo in 59-29:11.

He won further golds in the 400 metres (1909, 1911), long jump (1910), and as part of the quartet in the 4x100 metres relay (1910–12).

In 1897 he placed second in the shot and third in the hammer at the British championships and the following year he won the AAU shot and 56-lb. weight throw. In 1899, Sheldon confirmed his talents as an all-round weightman by taking a shot/discus double at the AAU championships and setting a world discus record of 122-3½ (37.27). In 1900, Sheldon won the British shot title with a new championship record and then crossed the Channel to Paris where he improved his best to 46-3¼ (14.10) and became the youngest ever winner of the Olympic shot put title. Reports of his being the youngest champion in an Olympic weight event are unfounded; examination of his birth certificate shows him to be born in 1878, not in 1880 as usually quoted.

Singh coped with the harsh treatment given to them at the hands of other boys by using his fists effectively and this soon came to the attention of scouts from the Sports Authority of India who were looking for natural talent amongst the population. He won a regional junior title in 1989 and soon graduated to the Indian national team. He was named best boxer at the King’s Cup in Thailand in 1997 but was overlooked for a place at the Asian Games the following year. After going on a drinking spree to drown his disappointment he was then then told that the decision was reversed. Singh made the most of his opportunity, beating two of the world’s top five ranked bantamweights and taking India’s first boxing gold at Asian Games level for 16 years. Hopes were high for him at the Sydney Olympics but, after a first-round bye, he was defeated by Serhiy Danylchenko of Ukraine, the European champion at the weight. Singh had been hampered by a wrist injury suffered in 1999, which never set correctly. When his sporting journey ended, he concentrated on his career in the Indian Navy to the expense of turning professional as a boxer.

37297,Ian Fairbairn,Male,14 April 1896,,, Great Britain,GBR,"Ian Fairbairn was educated at Eton College and then the Royal Military College at Sandhurst, from where he was commissioned into the Royal Horse Guards. He was posted to France in 1915, and transferred to the Guards Machine Gun Regiment in 1918. Fairbairn resigned his commission in 1919 after being seriously injured during the hostilities. Having rowed at college, Fairbairn joined the Thames Rowing Club shortly after World War I, and in 1920 was second in the Silver Goblets at Henley with the 1912 Olympian Bruce Logan. Fairbairn was a member of the Thames eight beaten by Leander in the final of the Grand Challenge Cup at Henley in 1922. He was, however, in the Thames crew that won the Grand the following year when they were coached by Fairbairn’s father Steve, a four-time Cambridge rowing Blue, and regarded as one of the finest coaches ever seen on the River Thames. The young Fairbairn was stroke of the Thames eight that represented Great Britain at the 1924 Paris Olympics and, despite setting an Olympic best time in their first round heat, they missed out on a medal after finishing fourth, just half-a-length behind bronze medallists Italy. Fairbairn worked on the London Stock Exchange for a while, and then worked in Paris. He stood as a Unionist (Conservative) Party candidate for Burnley at the 1925 and 1929 General Elections. After obtaining a degree at the London School of Economics, Fairbairn joined M&G Investments in 1935, and was responsible for pioneering Unit Trusts in Britain. M&G’s was the first Unit Trust quoted on the London Stock Market. He was a vice-president of the Thames RC for 40 years until being elected president in 1967, just a year before his death. He was also captain of the club in 1933 and was a Henley steward for 20 years from 1948 up to the time of his death. He also became chairman of M&G in 1943 and of the parent group, White Drummond, from 1955 until resigning both posts in 1967. Fairbairn’s second wife Esmée served with the Women’s Volunteer Service (RVS) during World War II and was a Civil Defence regional administrator. Sadly, she was killed outright when hit by a flying bomb in Kensington, London, in August 1944. In her memory, Fairbairn established the Esmée Fairbairn Charitable Trust in 1961 and he transferred his personal holding in White Drummond so the Trust could enjoy the financial benefits from it, and they went on to become one of the United Kingdom’s biggest fund raisers. In 2019 the Trust made grants of £35.8 million to a wide variety of beneficiaries like the environment, the arts, food and social change, and children and young people. In his later life, Fairbairn had a passion for Chamois stalking in such locations as the Pyranees and the Alps of Transylvania. At the time of his death in 1968, Fairbairn was the reigning public schools heavyweight boxing champion. He won the title in 1914 and it had not been contested since then.",Cousin of Eric Fairbairn

49320,Ada den Haan,Female,14 May 1941,180.0,80, Netherlands,NED,"On 13 November 1956, then 15-year-old Ada den Haan lowered the world record in the 200 m breaststroke in her hometown of Naarden, lowering the mark set by Éva Novák by 2.1 seconds. This would normally have made the teenager one of the top contenders for the Melbourne 1956 Olympics, but at that point it was already known that the Netherlands would boycott the Games over the Soviet response to the Hungarian revolt. In fact, the race had been specifically organized by her coach for a world record attempt now that she could not swim in Melbourne. Over the next few years, den Haan lowered the 200 m breaststroke world record three more times (although with slower times, as the tactic of long underwater periods had been banned after 1956), and in 1958 she won the European title in the event, adding a second gold in the medley relay. In Rome, 1960, den Haan was finally able to compete at the Olympics. She reached the final in both the 200 m breaststroke and the medley relay, but placed fourth on both occasions. In the relay, the Dutch team, anchored by Erica Terpstra, seemed to have narrowly edged out the German squad, but while the jury recorded the same time for both, it ranked the Germans in third. A double Dutch protest - against the finishing order and against the fact the Germans fielded a swimmer not entered in the individual events, as was required - was denied. For Den Haan, it marked the end of her international career. She later married Martien Swinkels, a swimming coach who would later count world champion Marcel Wouda among his pupils.","Listed in Olympians Who Set a European Record in Long Course Swimming (100 m breaststroke – 13 July 1957 - 20 July 1958: 1:21.1 (13 July 1957; Paris, FRA); 200 m breaststroke – 13 November 1956 - 1 May 1957 and 3 August 1957 - 25 July 1959: 2:46.4 (13 November 1956; Naarden, NED), 2:51.9 (3 August 1957; Rhenen, NED), 2:51.3 (4 August 1957; Rhenen, NED); 4×100 m medley relay – 8 December 1956 - 1 May 1957, 18 May 1957 - 25 July 1958, and 5 September 1958 - 15 July 1960: 4:53.1 (8 December 1956; Zwolle, NED), 4:57.0 (18 May 1957; Blackpool, GBR), 4:52.9 (5 September 1958; Budapest, HUN), 4:51.5 (26 July 1959; Waalwijk, NED), 4:47.3 (12 June 1960; Leipzig, GDR)) Listed in Olympians Who Set a World Record in Long Course Swimming (200 m breaststroke – 13 November 1956 - 25 July 1959: 2:46.4 (13 November 1956; Naarden, NED), 2:52.6 (18 May 1957; Blackpool, GBR), 2:51.9 (3 August 1957; Rhenen, NED), 2:51.3 (4 August 1957; Rhenen, NED); 4×100 m medley relay – 8 December 1956 - 25 July 1958 and 5 September 1958 - 6 September 1959: 4:53.1 (8 December 1956; Zwolle, NED), 4:57.0 (18 May 1957; Blackpool, GBR), 4:52.9 (5 September 1958; Budapest, HUN), 4:51.5 (26 July 1959; Waalwijk, NED)) Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the European Aquatics Championships (2–0–0 1958 Budapest SWM gold: 200 m breaststroke and 4×100 m medley relay)"

In 1935, he won the award for the best etching at that year’s Roma Quadrennial. After World War II his works displayed a resemblance to expressionist graphics. His paintings are characterized by broad brushstrokes and thick warm colors. His novel “Bicycle Thieves” was filmed by Vittorio de Sica and is considered one of the greatest films ever made. Bartolini was also an opponent of the Fascist dictatorship in Italy before World War II. In 1933 he was arrested for political reasons, and after one month in prison he went to Merano, where he remained until 1938.

As a youth Urbanovich played volleyball and did not take up gymnastics until her family moved to Moscow in 1935. Soon she rose to be one of the top gymnasts of the country and later the world.

However, he soon returned to South Africa to continue with his duties and then serve with the Royal Horse Guards in the Boer War 1900-01. He was mentioned in dispatches and received the G.C.V.O. (Knight Grand Cross, Royal Victorian Order) in 1907 Prior to acceding to the Dukedom he was known as Viscount Belgrave but was known to family and close friends as “Bendor”, named after the 1880 Epsom Derby winner Bend Or, which was owned by his grandfather the first Duke, The biggest private landlord in Britain, the Duke owned prime property in central London. He also owned a lot of property close to the family seat at Chester, in Scotland and shortly before his death he acquired Annacis Island in the Fraser River, British Columbia. Not surprisingly, the Duke was one of the wealthiest people in Britain at the time. He was a keen sportsman, and in addition to riding with the hounds, he was an excellent shooter, polo player and a enthusiastic car driver. He was also a keen participant in the new sport of motorboating and at the 1908 Olympics drove his own boat, Wolseley-Siddley which took part in both races in the A-Class competition. But following the abandoned first race due to adverse weather, Grosvenor and his crew, Winchester Clowes and George Atkinson ran aground near Hamble Bouy on the third lap of the second race as the tide was rescinding, and victory went to Émile Thubron, an Englishman representing France. The Duke of Westminster served in World War I with the Royal Naval Air Service Armoured Car Division and following service in France and Egypt he was honoured with the D.S.O. in 1916. He later gained the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel and Honorary Colonel in the service of the Cheshire Yeomanry and was decorated with the award of the Commander, Legion of Honour in 1934. The Lord-Lieutenant of Cheshire between 1907-20, Hugh Grosvenor, Duke of Westminster, was married four times but did not produce a surviving son and heir. He also had a much publicised affair with fashion designer Coco Chanel in the 1920s and she was a regular visitor to the family home at Lochmore Lodge in Scotland where the Duke died in 1953.",Listed in Olympians With a Net Worth > $100M (Estimated worth of $1.5B to 2.5B (inflation corrected) at time of death in 1953) Listed in Olympian Members of the Nobility (2nd Duke of Westminster)

Kleine took the Olympic 10,000 m gold and Stensen’s World Record at Innsbruck, but Stensen beat him head-to-head and reclaimed his World Record in a country match at Medeo at the end of the season.

He had studied architectural design and drawing in San Francisco first and then worked as a jewelry designer. He then studied in Paris from 1904-07 at the Académie Julian. This was followed by a study visit to Roma. Back in the US he built a studio in Manhattan and became well-known as a sculptor in bronze and marble, and as a designer and engraver of American coins. In 1946 he was awarded the Saltus Medal of the Numismatic Society for his work in medals. Beach was president of the National Sculpture Society and a member of the National Institute of Arts and Letters. In 1910 he had invented a small electric motor, which led to the development of kitchen mixers. The “Greek Games” were held at the Barnard College for Women in New York since 1904. The 1905 class commissioned Chester Beach with a sculpture to mark the 25th anniversary of the Games. The statue was unveiled in 1927 and sent to Amsterdam in 1928. A Greek inscription is chiselled into the base, which translates to “winner is the one who runs first and last”, related to the torch relay. The bronze statue used to be located in the lobby, later outside behind Barnard Hall. After having suffering from the weather, it was restored in 2014.",Father of Beata Beach

First named in the Dutch seven in 1955, he helped advance his team into the top tier of Dutch water polo a year later. A solid fullback with a feared shot, he was also selected for the Melbourne Olympics but the Dutch boycotted these Games at the last moment over the Soviet crackdown of the Hungarian revolt. As captain, Lamme led the Dutch team at the 1958 European Championships, placing sixth. Lamme retired from the national team in 1959, having to take over his father’s barber shop, but with the 1960 Rome Olympics on the horizon, he was asked to return and obliged, but was unable to propel the Dutch to success as they came in eighth.

17971,Foxhall Keene,Male,18 December 1867,,, Great Britain,GBR,"The informal nature of the 1900 Olympic polo tournament is best illustrated by the fact that two years after winning a gold medal with the Foxhunters team, Foxhall Keene played for America against Great Britain in the Westchester Cup. Foxhall Keene started his polo career as a 16-year-old with the Rockaway Hunt Club, New York and at the age of 18 played in the first Westchester Cup match at Newport, Rhode Island in 1886 when he had the distinction of scoring the first ever goal in international polo. Although the visiting British team won 10-4, Keene scored for the home team after only 24 seconds of play. Keene was the only player to appear in all of the first six Westchester Cup matches, in 1886, 1900 and 1902, and he only missed the 1913 series after breaking a collar bone in the final workout. He was the first American to be given a 10-goal handicap and maintained that rating for 14 of the next 28 years. Keene won the US Senior Championship five times, with Rockaway in 1896 and 1907, Westchester in 1899, Lakewood in 1901 and Meadow Brook in 1912. Keene spent two years at Harvard as a special student with the Class of ‘91 before transferring to the Law School, where he stayed only for one year. He then joined his father and helped direct the family’s substantial business interests. During this period he was a familiar figure at Castleton Farm in Kentucky, on the hunting and polo fields of England, and was also seen riding with the famous Quorn Hunt in Leicestershire near his home in Melton Mowbray. Keene enjoyed many successes on the turf on both sides of the Atlantic. Foxhall Keene was a talented and versatile sportsman. In 1897 he finished 31st in the US Open Golf Championship and the following year reached the quarter-finals of the US Amateur Championship before losing to the renowned Walter Travis. After being badly injured when his car crashed into a telegraph pole in the 1905 Vanderbilt cup races, he gave up motor racing and devoted himself to other sports as a result of which he played in the 1914 World Rackets Championships. Keene never married and in 1913 went to live with his sister in Canada where he eventually died in poverty. Although Keene was a US national all his life, at the 1900 Paris Olympics he played for Foxhunters Hurlingham, a British polo club.",

He placed only sixth in the 200 fly at his first international appearance, the 1992 Olympics, but in 1993, at the European Championships in Sheffield, Pankratov won his first international medals, gold medals in the 200 butterfly and medley relay and a silver in the 100 fly. He improved this performance at the 1995 European Championships, winning all three gold medals and breaking Pablo Morales nine-year-old 100 metre butterfly world record with a time of 52.32. Pankratov had swum his first world record a month before the 1995 European Championships in 200 butterfly, recording 1:55.22 in France and that world record stood for over five years until Tom Malchow broke it in 2000. At the 1994 World Championships in Rome, Pankratov won gold in the 200 butterfly, silvers in both the medley and 4×200 freestyle relay and bronze in the 100 fly. But Pankratov’s greatest performance probably occurred at the 1996 Olympics, where he won both butterfly events and silver in the medley relay and set his third and final world record by clocking 52.27 in the 100 butterfly final. Pankratov was named as the male World Swimmer of the Year by Swimming World magazine in 1995 and 1996 and was named as the male European Swimmer of the Year in the same years.

18013,Bert Solomon,Male,8 March 1885,,, Great Britain,GBR,"The son of a miner, Bert Solomon came from a poor background but went on to become one of the finest rugby centres Redruth and Cornwall has ever produced. He left school at the age of 12 to get a job in a bacon factory and around the same time he became interested in pigeon fancying which was his first love until he was persuaded to give rugby a try with his local team, Treleigh. He enjoyed it and soon showed some exceptional skills and was recruited by Redruth. He made his début for them at the age of 19 and by the time he was 21 he was a County player and went on to play for Cornwall 26 times. Consequently, Solomon was sought after by many top clubs but, apart from occasionally helping out Devonport Albion, he remained loyal to Redruth. His outstanding skill in the 1908 County Championship final against Durham virtually won the title single-handedly for Cornwall and he scored two of their five tries. He scored Cornwall’s only try in the Olympic ‘final’ against Australia. After being selected as a reserve for England on several occasions, his skill eventually got him an England call-up and he made his début against Wales in the first ever international at Twickenham in January 1910. Before the match the crowd were wondering who Solomon was. After the game, they certainly knew, because he made one wonder try and scored a brilliant solo effort as England won 11-6 and inflicted the first defeat on Wales in 12 years. Again, victory was down to a single-handed effort from Solomon who was then penned as “The finest centre in living memory” by the press. Solomon felt intimidated by his wealthier team-mates who came from a different class to him and, despite being selected for England’s three other games that season, he declined to play. He also declined an offer to go on tour with the British Lions and was happier to stay in Cornwall looking after his pigeons and his allotment. His self-inflicted sense of inferiority meant he never played top class rugby again, instead he turned out occasionally for the Treleigh Junior Rugby Club. Bert’s older brother Barney also played for Redruth and Cornwall.",Brother of Barney Solomon

He was first noticed by Soviet sports officials in 1951 and in 1953 won his first two Soviet titles in the 5 and 10,000. He repeated that double victory at the Soviet Championships three more times (1954-56) and won the 10K and cross-country titles in 1957. In 1954, Kuts established himself as one of the world’s best long-distance runners, winning the European 5,000 title with a world record of 13:56.6 and beating such stars as Emil Zatopek and Chris Chataway. A month later, Kuts lost his world record to Chataway, but took it back 10 days later, clocking 13:51.2 in Prague. In September 1955, Kuts set his third 5,000 m world record by clocking 13:46.8 in Belgrade and although his world record was broken by Sándor Iharos and Gordon Pirie before the 1956 Olympics, he still went to the Olympics as the favorite to win both long-distance golds as just a month and a half before the Olympics, Kuts had broken the 10K world record of 28:30.4. At the Olympics, he first won the gold in 10,000, leading from start-to-finish and then five days later won the 5,000 m in a similar fashion. He set his last world record in the 5K in 1957, running 13:35.0 in Rome, but soon after that he was forced to retire from athletics due to constant stomach pains that prevented him from training properly. After his retirement, Kuts worked as an athletics coach, but the constant stomach pains led to drinking, which led to the loss of his job. In his last years, Kuts’ alcoholism deepened and he became seriously overweight, and suffered a stroke in 1972. On 16 August 1975, his lifeless body was found in his flat in what seemed an apparent suicide from mixing sleeping pills and alcohol.

He began swimming four years later and, at the age of seventeen, earned his first of 34 national titles. He earned his first major international medal, bronze in the 400 metre individual medley, at the 1979 Pan American Games, and held the world record in the 200 metre individual medley by the time he attended the 1982 Commonwealth Games, where he took home gold in the 200 and 400 m individual medleys and bronze in the 4x100 metre medley relay (with Blair Hicken, Peter Szmidt, and the non-Olympian Graham Welbourn). He also served as Canada’s flagbearer and met his future wife, swimmer Tracy Taggart, at this tournament. Chronic shoulder pain kept him out of the 1982 World Championships, but he persisted and won gold in the 200 and 400 m individual medleys at the 1983 Summer Universiade, where he was again Canada’s flagbearer. He was selected to represent Canada at the 1984 Summer Olympics and attended, despite the deaths of his father and brother prior to the tournament, serving once again as his nation’s flagbearer. He became a double gold medalist by winning the 200 and 400 m individual medleys, and also finished fifth in the 4x200 m freestyle relay (alongside Szmidt, Benoit Clément, Sandy Goss, and Wayne Kelly), seventh in the 4x100 m freestyle relay (with Goss, Hicken, Dave Churchill, and Levente Mady), and seventeenth in the 200 m freestyle event. Baumann added to his gold medal haul at the 1986 Commonwealth Games, winning the 200 and 400 m individual medleys, as well as the 4x100 m relay (with Goss, Victor Davis, Tom Ponting, Mark Tewksbury, Mike West, and the non-Olympians Claude Lamy and Darcy Wallingford). He also took silver in the 4x100 m freestyle relay alongside Goss, Hicken, and Vlastimil Cerny. His final major international medals came at the 1986 World Championships, where he earned silver and bronze in the 200 and 400 m individual relays respectively. He retired from active competition in 1987 and began working as a coach, and had a stint as a commentator for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation at the 1988 Summer Olympics. A graduate of Laurentian University, he moved to Australia in the 1990s to pursue graduate studies at the University of Queensland and became involved in the coaching and administration of swimming in the region, culminating in his appointment as CEO of Queensland Swimming in 1999. After being rejected for a vacant position on the Canadian Olympic Committee, he continued to work in Australia and, in 2012, moved to New Zealand to take on the mantle of Chief Executive of High Performance Sport New Zealand. He has also continued to swim in masters-level tournaments, setting a world record in the 200 m individual medley for the 45-49 age group in March 2009. Among numerous honors, he was named to the Order of Canada in 1984 and the Order of Ontario in 1988, won the Lionel Conacher Award as Canada’s top male athlete of 1984, was named Swimming World Magazine’s Male Swimmer of the Year in 1981 and 1984, and was inducted into Canada’s Sports (1987) and the International Swimming (1992) Halls of Fame.

For 10 years he attended evening and Sunday classes at the Ghent Royal Academy of Fine Arts until he received an award for sculpturing in 1908, which allowed him to work without financial pressure for some time. In 1929, he built his own Art Déco house, which also hosted his workshop. He mainly created bronze, marble, wood and gypsum sculptures and statues in Art Déco style. Sarteel changed styles from romantic realism to symbolism. In 1936, he took part in the Venezia Biennale and had various solo exhibitions in Belgium. Since he never took a job as an art teacher, he had to rely on the income from selling his works, which was difficult just prior and during World War II. His house with the atelier was restored by his son in 2001 and became a museum which is regularly visited. At 59, he died of a heart attack.

Joining the track club, his performances led to national junior titles in Suriname and the Netherlands (of which Suriname was still a colony at the time). Having moved to the Netherlands to study, he gained his first Dutch senior title in 100 m in August 1968. This performance led to him being nominated for the Mexico Olympics. That was not just a notable moment for Monsels, but also for his entire nation, as he became the first athlete to represent Suriname at the Olympic Games. In 1960, Wim Esajas had travelled to the Rome Games, but he never competed due to an official’s mistake. In Mexico, Monsels managed to reach the quarter-finals, where he placed last in his heat and was eliminated. Monsels later won two more Dutch titles, repeating his 100 m win in 1971, and also claiming the 1970 60 m title (indoor). After completing his studies in geology at Leiden University, Monsels moved back to Suriname, where he taught at Anton de Kom University. He occasionally still competed, running in the 1977 Central American and Caribbean Championships. Around that time, he also joined the board of the national athletics federation.

The design for the Great (Olympic) Stadium of Beograd dates back to 1947, when the team was awarded the first prize of a tender. The stadium was to be built in the Beograd district of Banjica to accommodate 80,000 spectators. The design was characterized by two semicircular opposite shells and tried to reconcile the theoretical and technical requirements. The project, however, did not go beyond the planning phase. Turina and Neidhardt received another honorable mention for his work Project for Stadium for Zagreb in the same category. The football stadium in Zagreb is the largest in the city and was named after the district in which it is located as Maksimir Stadium. Located on the site of an old stadium from 1912, it was built in the late 1940s according to plans by Neidhardt and Turina from 1946. Except for the catalog of the art exhibition, most sources also mention Eugen Erlich as the third architect. Over a period of 15 years, sections of the building were completed successively. The entire complex also included a second, smaller stadium, a swimming pool, a sports hall and the corresponding infrastructure. In 1998, a major refurbishment of the stadium began, but could not be completed. Later, the original capacity of 64,000 spectators had to be reduced significantly due to the installation of seats. In 2011, further minor improvements were made. Turina was an associate professor, planner, builder, critic and architecture theorist, city planner, master of graphic expression, excellent educator, and lucid man of letters. He studied and graduated in 1936 in Zagreb and and later taught there and occasionally in Berlin. He was engaged mainly in studies of airfields, hospitals, theaters and sports facilities. One of his best known projects is his design of the swimming pool in Rijeka. There was a project by Vladimir Turina in 1948/49 for a large sports complex with a combined indoor and outdoor swimming pool in Sušak, a district of Rijeka. It could not be confirmed whether there was an invitation for a competition. The Flexible Swimming Pool was submitted in 1952 by Turina for the Helsinki art exhibition. The so-called “Delta” was envisaged as a recreational, leisure, and entertainment center for the twin cities. Among the technologically avant-garde features of Turina’s proposal were pools with a movable cylindrical roof that could be adjusted to the changing seasons. The realization of the design ultimately failed due to disputes over land ownership.",

Two years later, now a Canadian senior champion in the 100 m and a student Clemson University, he represented his nation at the 1979 Pan American Games, finishing sixth in the 200 m and eighth in the 100 m. He was the 100 and 200 metre Canadian champion in 1980 and was selected to compete at that year’s Summer Olympics, but stayed home after Canada joined the boycott of those Games. After setting a national record in the 200 m in 1981, he travelled to the 1982 Commonwealth Games, where he won silver in the 4x100 metre relay alongside Ben Johnson, Mark McKoy, and Tony Sharpe. He then won silver in the 100 m at the 1983 Summer Universiade, behind Chidi Imoh of Nigeria, but was less successful at that year’s World Championships, coming in eighth in the 100 m, and being eliminated in the semifinals of the 200 m and disqualified in the 4x100 m relay. He finally got a chance to attend the Summer Olympics in 1984, where he won a bronze medal in the 4x100 m relay with Johnson, Sharpe, and Sterling Hinds. He was also eliminated in the semifinals of both the 100 and 200 m events.

After coming in third and second at the 1995 and 1996 European Championships respectively, he was third in two-man at the 1996 World Championships, but then earned gold the following year. He was also the original winner of the four-man event, but was disqualified alongside the second- and third-placing Swiss teams for competing with a bobsled that the national team had been using all season, unaware that it was illegal. He was also champion in the four-man and third place in the two-man at the 1997 European Championships. Götschi and Acklin returned to the Winter Olympics in 1998 as reigning World and European Champions, but a strong pool of competitors relegated them to sixth place in the two-man. Acklin retired from active competition in 1999, after a final European title in the two-man, but Götschi continued to compete and earned silver in the two-man at the 2001 World Championships, alongside Cédric Grand. Götschi retired from active competition in May 2002, having captured nine Swiss national titles in the two-man and two in the four-man. By career he was originally a home building and house inspector but, in August 2011, he became the CEO of “Swiss Sliding”, Switzerland’s luge, bobsleigh, and skeleton federation.","Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the European Bob & Skeleton Championships (3–1–2 1995 Altenberg bronze: Two-man; 1996 St. Moritz silver: Two-man; 1997 Königssee gold: Four-man, bronze: Two-man; 1998 Igls gold: Two-man; 1999 Winterberg gold: Two-man) Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the World Bob & Skeleton Championships (FIBT/IBSF) (1–1–1 1996 Calgary bronze: Two-man; 1997 St. Moritz gold: Two-man; 2001 St. Moritz silver: Two-man)"

920911,Filippo Sgarlata,Male,24 November 1901,,, Italy,ITA,"Italian sculptor and medalist Filippo Sgarlata was born in Tunis in 1901 and began his study at the L’Accademia di Belle Arti di Palermo at the suggestion of Francesco Messina in 1918 when he passed the entrance exam with honors. He moved to Roma in 1919 and attended the art academy and the school for medalists. From 1926-32 Sgarlata lived in the United States, but after returning to Italy became a medalist and a professor for sculpturing in Palermo and San Luca. He also created some works in line with Fascist ideology during Mussolini’s dictatorship. However, he soon gained recognition again and exhibited at important exhibitions in Europe (Biennale Venedig, Roma, Bruxelles, London, Barcelona and Madrid). In 1961 he created the Marian Gate of the Palermo Cathedral. Sgarlata received an Honorable Mention at the 1948 London Olympics for his medals La Caccia and Il Disco in the category Sculpture, Medals and Plaques, and for his bronze statuette La Pesca in the category Sculpture, Statues. Thus, he was the only artist with two Honorable Mentions at one Olympics in different categories. La Pesca, mostly called Pescatore con giacchio (Fisherman with Casting Net) dates from 1942 and is 32 cm high including a marble base. With the cast-bronze medallion La caccia al cinghiale (Boar Hunt) from 1934, Sgarlata also won a gold medal at an international exhibition in Madrid in 1951. It bears the inscription VENATOR IMPAVIDUS (The Fearless Hunter). It has a diameter of 200 mm, embossed in bronze, silver and gold of 71 mm. The second cast-bronze plaque appears under the titles Discobolo Lancio del Disco or just Il Disco (Discus Thrower or The Discus) and was created in 1947. The model could have been the Polish Olympic champion Halina Konopacka, who frequently wore a beret in competition. The fourth work submitted, a sculpture, is called Hawking in the art catalog, but in Italian sources only La Caccia (The Hunt). Since no sculpture could be identified showing falconry, it may well be the statuette Cacciatore con cane e fagiano (Hunter with Dog and Pheasant).",

He studied in Berlin and Weimar, The Netherlands, Paris (1873-78), and Venice. Via München, he returned to Berlin in 1884. In 1892 the “Association of the XI” was established, from which the “Berlin Secession” emerged. Liebermann soon became the leader and first president of the group, resigning in 1911. In 1907 on the occasion of his 60th birthday, a special exhibition of the Berlin Secession was held in his honor. The city of Berlin made him an honorary citizen on his 80th birthday. From 1920-32 Liebermann served as president of the Berlin Academy of Arts. He was regarded as representative of the liberal arts policy of the Weimar period. Liebermann attracted the criticism of the nationalist parties, especially the Nazis. In 1933, he was - like so many – banned from academic life, and in 1935 died at his home, having already withdrawn from the art scene and public life two years earlier. When his wife Martha (1857-1943) was to be deported to the Theresienstadt concentration camp in 1943, she took her own life with sleeping pills. Polo Players (full title: Polo Players in Jenisch Park) was painted in oil on canvas as early as 1903. It measures 71 x 102 cm. Until 1941, it was owned by the Hamburg Kunsthalle and since then it has been in private hands. It is illustrated in the catalog of the art exhibition. In 1909, Liebermann created the lithograph Horse Race (22 x 34 cm). An oil painting with this motif also dated from the same year. It is unclear which other graphics by Liebermann were exhibited. In the international exhibition catalog, there is only a general reference: 33 a-f Oeuvres graphiques. In the German catalog, in addition to Boy with Horse (lithograph), Horse Racing I and II (lithographs), Horse Racing III (etching), and Polo Players (etching) are listed.

921101,Martin Monnickendam,Male,25 February 1874,,, Netherlands,NED,"Martin Monnickendam was a Dutch painter and draftsman. He was educated in 1891-93 at the Academy of Fine Arts and was a pupil of Felix Meritis in Amsterdam. Subsequently, he lived in Paris for two years from 1895. Monnickendam worked in the genres of painting, watercolors, etchings, drawing and lithography. He often painted subjects of the city of Amsterdam or Jewish themes, but also figures, portraits, landscapes, animals, and still lifes. In Amsterdam he belonged to several art associations, including Arti et Amicitiae and the Painters’ Guild of Sint Lukas. During the 1920s he traveled in various European countries. In 1934 he was appointed an officer of the Order of Orange-Nassau. He died of pneumonia in 1943 shortly before his planned deportation to a concentration camp. The painting submitted in 1928 may have been De Biljartwedstrijd, although it was already painted in 1907. Today it is usually titled Billiard Academy. It shows the hall “De Vereeniging” in Amsterdam, where under the guise of a “billiard academy” matches between so-called “professionals” took place. The public could bet on these games. The painting depicts the moment of the winners’ pay-off. Since it is marked in the catalog as a “painting”, it was probably the version oil on canvas (120 x 200 cm), which is in the Amsterdam Museum. An almost identical watercolor also exists. A much younger painting is “Concourse Hippique tijdens de Olympische Spelen in het Olympisch Stadion in 1928”, submitted as At the Olympic Games, which was created in the same year 1928. It is a watercolor/pastel of 63.2 x 83 cm. Monnickendam’s first participation was in 1924 with the painting De amazon, also in oil on canvas (200 x 140 cm) from 1915. The painting from the Stedelijk Museum Zutphen shows his pupil and later colleague Margot van Hasselt (1879–1935).",

The fifth-generation Penrose was educated at Rugby School, and then Christ Church, Oxford. At Rugby, he was a very good rifle shooter and competed in the Ashburton Shield. His son was in the winning Winchester team in 1905, and his grandson was in the Charterhouse team that won the Shield in 1931. Penrose captained the Oxford University rifle shooting team. He was ordained in 1874 and worked in several parishes before taking up the post at West Ashton. In addition to shooting, Penrose became one of the best-known archers in the south-west of England, and in 1904 won the UK Championship and, with it, the coveted Spedding Memorial Challenge Cup. At the 1908 London Olympics, he finished fourth in the Double York Round, although he had more total hits and golds than the bronze medallist Henry Richardson (USA), but he lost out to the American on total points scored.

Kurlovich took up weightlifting in 1973 and rose to the Soviet national team 10 years later. In that same year, Kurlovich first came to international prominence when he finished second at both the European and World Championships to his fellow Ukrainian Soviet, Anatoliy Pysarenko. In 1984, he and Pysarenko were considered as the main favorites for Olympic super-heavyweight gold, but they missed the Olympics due to the Soviet boycott. At the Friendship Games, which were held by the nations that boycotted the 1984 Olympics, Kurlovich lost to Pysarenko, who lifted a world record 465.0 kg, by 2.5 kg but Kurlovich still lifted 50 kg more than the 1984 Olympic champion Dean Lukin. Later in 1984, both Pysarenko and Kurlovich were arrested at Mirabel Airport in Montréal when customs officials searched their luggage and found anabolic steroids. The two were convicted by Canadian authorities and fined. Soviet officials dismissed them from the national team and stripped them of their status as “Masters of Sport,” thus losing all the funding and benefits. Pysarenko, three years senior to Kurlovich, decided to quit weightlifting and later became a successful businessman and president of the Ukrainian Weightlifting Federation, but Kurlovich worked his way back to the Soviet national team. Despite no funding and no support from Soviet sports officials, Kurlovich made it back to the national team in 1987 and returned stronger than ever. Kurlovich won the 1987 World Championship with a world record and repeated this victory in 1989, 1991, and 1994. He was also European super-heavyweight champion in 1989 and 1990. Domestically, Kurlovich was the Soviet super-heavyweight champion in 1983, 1989 and 1991, while taking silver in 1984 and 1987.

The conversion into the Stadio dei Centomila, later renamed Olympic Stadium, was started on 28 December 1950 to foster the bid for the 1960 Roma Olympics. The leaders of the project were Cesare Valle, then director of the Centro Studi Impianti Sportivi C. O. N. I., and Prof. Carlo Roccatelli (?-1951). At the time, the planned stadium was considered as one of the world’s top sports facilities. However, the scarce financial resources and the characteristics of the local environment led to a less ambitious construction. After the death of Roccatelli, the architect Annibale Vitelozzi (1902-1990) took over the management.",

Educated at Winchester School and Oriel College, Oxford, Bridges was an excellent all-round sportsman. He was a football Blue and played in the very first Varsity Match against Cambridge in 1873/74. He captained the side in the game the following season and was also a member of the Oxford University squad that won the FA Cup final for the first time in 1874. Despite playing in the quarter-final win over the holders, Wanderers, and then Clapham Rovers in the semi-final, however, he never played in the win over the Royal Engineers in the final. Bridges was also an excellent cricketer and, with his father, was one of the pioneers of the Beddington Cricket Club in its formative years. He played two First Class matches for Surrey in the 1876 season, scoring just nine runs from two completed innings. Apart from being a fine archer, Bridges was also an excellent rifle shooter, mostly on his Aberdeenshire estates. He was runner-up in the British National Archery Championships in 1904 but went one better the following year when he captured the title and, with it, the coveted Spedding Memorial Challenge Cup. At the 1908 London Olympics, Bridges finished a commendable fifth in the Double York Round and was the leading scorer from 60 yards. Away from his sporting endeavours, Bridges was a Justice of the Peace (JP) for both Surrey and Aberdeenshire, where he and his wife divided their time. He was also the High Sheriff of Surrey in 1919-20, a post his grandfather Sir Henry Bridges held in 1813-14. John Bridges was a notable breeder of the famous Aberdeen-Angus cattle, which he introduced into England in 1876, and in 1905 he became the first English breeder to be appointed president of the Aberdeen-Angus Cattle Society. Bridges had six sons who all fought with distinction in World War I, and he was honoured to receive a personal letter from King George V expressing his thanks for the dedication given to their country by each of his sons.",

Bigger than almost any decathlete of his era at 6-3 (1.90) and 225 lbs. (102 kg.), he had seemingly incongruous personal bests in the 100 of 10.2 (1970) and in the shot put of 18.56 (60-10¾) (1969). His only Olympic appearance in 1964 resulted in a ninth-place finish but in 1966, he became world record holder with 8,230 points (8,119 on the 1985 tables), narrowly defeating his arch-rival, Bill Toomey. Despite his immense talent, Hodge was often injured, which likely kept him from reaching his potential. He twice competed at the Pan American Games, finishing 4th in 1963 and 2nd in 1971. His mother, Alice Arden, high jumped at the 1936 Olympic Games.

3445,Harry Mallin,Male,1 June 1892,,, Great Britain,GBR,"Henry Mallin, a 28-year-old London policeman and the ABA champion of 1919 and 1920, opened his bid for the Olympic middleweight title at Antwerp in 1920 by out-pointing Lt. Joseph Cranston of the US Army. Cranston, who later became a general, told Mallin that he could only be consoled for losing his first fight, after a 5,000 mile journey, if he knew that he had been beaten by the Olympic champion. In due course, Mallin provided that consolation. In his second bout, Harry Mallin defeated another American, Sam Lagonia, who was disqualified for persistent holding. As the 1920 US Official Report put it, the Americans were “seething with volcanic indignation” at the decision and threatened to withdraw from the Games. The situation eventually calmed and, after a straightforward win over the Canadian, Moe Herscovitch, in the semi-finals, Mallin met another Canadian, Art Prud’homme, in the final. The tough French-Canadian soldier, who had won each of his three previous bouts by a KO, gave Mallin a hard time throughout but the Englishman did enough to get the verdict. One of the people who helped chair him from the ring was his first round victim Joseph Cranston. In 1924 Mallin began the defense of his Olympic crown at the Velodrome d’Hiver in Paris. After two easy wins he met the home-town hero, Roger Brousse, in the quarter-finals with dramatic results. The bout went the full three rounds and Brousse appeared to have won comfortably, but before the decision was announced Mallin told officials that he had been bitten on the arms and chest, pointing to his opponent’s teeth marks in support of his complaint. Neither Mallin, nor the British team managers, protested officially but when the judges awarded the fight to Brousse the Swedish officials lodged an official complaint on Mallin’s behalf. The jury d’appel met until the early hours of the morning and heard a great deal of evidence, including that of an American who said that he too had been bitten by Brousse in an earlier fight. No decision was reached at the first meeting and the Jury re-convened the following evening, the boxing program being held up until their deliberations had been completed. Finally it was announced that Brousse had been disqualified. Pandemonium followed. Fights started around the hall and the disqualified Brousse was carried shoulder-high around the ring by his supporters. Meanwhile, Mallin and his opponent in the semi-final, Joseph Beecken of Belgium, sat in the ring and watched the commotion. Eventually the bout started, Mallin out-pointed the Belgian and went on to meet his teammate, John Elliott, in the final the following night. Reports of the final are somewhat limited as, at the sight of Mallin climbing into the ring, the French crowd renewed their demonstrations and neither the press nor the spectators enjoyed an uninterrupted view of the bout. It was, apparently, a close fight with the verdict going to Mallin, who became the first man ever to successfully defend an Olympic boxing title. This was the last fight of Mallins’ distinguished ring career during which he won two Olympic gold medals and five ABA titles and remained undefeated in more than 300 bouts. He was manager of the British Olympic boxing team at Berlin in 1936 and the following year he gave the first ever television sports commentary in Britain when two amateur contests were transmitted from the Concern Hall, Alexandra Palace. He was again manager of the Olympic boxing team in 1952 and in his later years held high office in the ABA. His brother, Fred Mallin, was also a five-time British middleweight champion.",Brother of Fred Mallin

A serious back injury kept him away from the water from three years and, after being accepted by Cambridge University, he did not row again until his third year of college. Upon reaching full fitness he was quickly drafted into the British national eight and was a part of the crew that finished second at the 1999 World Championships. The following year the crew upped their performance and became Olympic champions in Sydney. Although his only world title was as part of a coxless four in 2002, he was an established member of the eight for the rest of his career. West’s crews were regular finalists at major championships but another medal constantly eluded them. He began to suffer injuries towards the latter part of his career and was so disillusioned with this and the internal politics of the British programme that he walked away from the sport six months before the 2008 Olympics. He studied Economics and Mathematics at Cambridge and later taught the subjects at a private school before returning to Cambridge for post graduate studies in Military History.

In 1923 she was commissioned to organize a winter carnival in Worcester, and she asked Arthur Walden to give a sled dog demonstration. She then married Milton Seeley and they honeymooned in New Hampshire, staying at Walden’s Inn, and later moved to the White Mountain Region. Shortly thereafter, they adopted an Alaskan Malamute Chinook dog from Walden’s Wonalancet Kennel. In 1929 Walden accompanied Admiral Byrd to Antarctica, taking several of his Chinooks with him. While gone, he left the Seeleys in charge of his kennel, and after his return, when he had financial difficulty, they bought the kennel from him. Eva Seeley immediately changed the bloodline of the kennel, buying dogs from Leonhard Seppala, including a Siberian Husky named Toto, the daughter of Togo, who had been the lead dog when Seppala made the famous Great Serum Run in January 1925 in Alaska. The Seeleys changed the name of the kennel to Chinook Kennel, and began breeding Huskies and Malamutes. One of her dogs, Queen Husky I, later became the second mascot dog for the Northeastern University Huskies. Chinook Kennel provided dogs for the US Military to use in search-and-rescue missions. During World War II she taught US soldiers how to work as a team with sled dogs. Several of her dogs were used during the Battle of the Bulge. Seeley was instrumental in having Alaskan Malamutes officially recognized by the American Kennel Club (AKC) in 1935. The Alaskan Malamute Club of America (AMCA) became a member of the AKC in 1953 and Seeley was its first President, and became an AKC Judge.

In capturing the title, he broke the competition record by nearly 13 ft (4m). A month later he would become the discus and shot champion at the Southern Youth Championships, and then won both titles at the London Schools Championships. King made his international début in 1963 and announced that year that he wanted to go to the United States to study physics, and further his athletics career. He was subsequently offered a track and field scholarship at the University of Colorado. He returned to the UK in 1966 to finish second to Bill Tancred in the AAA shot. By 1970, King was specialising in the decathlon and he won another AAA silver medal that year when second to Peter Gabbett. At that year’s British Commonwealth Games King won decathlon bronze. Another return trip to the UK in 1972 saw King win the AAA decathlon title that had eluded him, when he beat defending champion David Kidner into second place. King was selected for the München Olympics that year, and in 1974 he went to Christchurch, New Zealand, for the British Commonwealth Games, and won the silver medal behind Northern Ireland’s Mike Bull. King later became Associate Dean of Students at the University of California, San Diego. In 1977, along with friend and training partner Bill Toomey, the pair founded the sports marketing company “Sports Directions”. They developed Olympic sports programmes for clients around the world including for the Los Angeles Olympic Organizing Committee. When Toomey set a new decathlon world record 8,417 points at Los Angeles in 1969, King finished third – a long way behind Toomey. King joined the US Olympic Committee (USOC) in 1987 and was Director of Marketing Communications for 14 years. During his time in office, he secured funding for many US Olympic teams, as well as organizing finance for the 1996 Atlanta and 2002 Salt Lake City Games. After leaving the USOC in 2001, King founded “Outdoor-Fitness”, a company that installed outdoor exercise equipment into schools, and other important establishments. He was also a board member of the San Diego-based Pharmaceutical Manufacturing company, “Imagenetix”. King also wrote, or co-wrote several books, including the USOC’s two-book series entitled “The Olympic Challenge”. As a youngster, King was a keen amateur astronomer.

He never won an NCAA title at Yale, which is unusual in that he dominated American sprint swimming from 1934-39. Fick was AAU Champion in the 100 metres outdoors in 1935-38 and indoors in the 100 yards in 1935-39. He won AAU 4x100 yard relay titles with the NYAC in 1934-36. Fick set three world records for the 100 metres. In 1934 he broke Johnny Weissmuller’s vaunted record of 57.4 from 1924, recording 56.8, and he improved that in 1935 with 56.6, and in 1936 with 56.4. He went to the 1936 Olympics a slight favorite in the 100 freestyle, but placed sixth, although American officials disputed the finish and thought he may actually have been a medalist. In 1938 Fick swam anchor on an American 4x100 metre relay that broke the world record (3:59.2) and became the first relay team to better four minutes for the distance. Fick would have been favored at the 1940 Olympics in the 100 freestyle but never had that opportunity. Fick served in the Navy during World War II, teaching officers to swim. He became a well-known radio actor in New York, and appeared in cigarette ads in newspapers. Fick eventually settled in Miami in the 1950s, where he taught swimming and ran recreational programs at several hotels. He was inducted into the International Swimming Hall of Fame in 1978.","Listed in Olympians Who Set a World Record in Long Course Swimming (100 m freestyle – 2 March 1934 - 13 April 1944: 56.8 (2 March 1934; New Haven, USA), 56.6 (5 March 1935; New Haven, USA), 56.4 (11 February 1936; New Haven, USA); 4×100 m freestyle relay – 20 August 1938 - 8 March 1940: 3:59.2 (20 August 1938; Berlin, GER))"

He interrupted his studies to take part in the Finnish Civil War in 1918 and then in the Estonian War of Independence. His first compositions were written after he resumed his studies in Helsinki. In the 1920s he continued his studies in Paris and Wien. His main inspiration was French composers, especially Maurice Ravel, but also Russians like Igor Stravinsky. From 1930 Klami became increasingly known as a composer. During this period he began to write music based on motifs from the Finnish Kalevala epic. In addition, he worked for several years as a teacher at the People’s Conservatory, but mainly as a music critic for magazines. During the Winter War, Klami joined the medical service. After that, his music took on a more nationally conservative character. In 1949-50 he made another study trip to Paris. Only two years after being appointed a member of the Finnish Academy, Klami died of a heart attack suffered during a boat trip from his summer home on the island of Kujaholmi. Over time, his music moved away from its romantic beginnings. He was considered a “European composer” on the one hand but also a “national modernist”. His compositions include quotations of folk music as well as elements of jazz. Klami is regarded as a master in the use of the orchestra and, after Jean Sibelius, the most important Finnish composer. His 1952 entry, Pyöräilijä (Cyclists), is a 7-minute long rondo for orchestra, written in 1946. The premiere took place on 1 July 1947. In 1992 it appeared for the first time on CD, recorded by the Lahti Symphony Orchestra.",

This begin a rivalry between her and fellow Olympian Ingeborg Pfüller, which would continue at the unofficial South American Championships of 1953, where Avellan edged out Pfüller for gold in the discus. The following year saw Isabel set her first South American discus record with a throw of 43.86, and although this was soon broken by Pfüller, she would reclaim the record in February 1955 with an effort of 46.05. Pfüller turned the tables on Avellán later in the year at the Pan-American Games in Mexico, when the teammates finished 1-2 in the discus, but later in the year Avellán bounced back by adding nearly a metre to the record mark at a meeting in Buenos Aires. The years of 1955 and 1956 were difficult for Argentine sport as the country attempted to stabilize following the coup that deposed President Juan Peron and established a military dictatorship. For a while it was doubtful whether the nation would participate at the Melbourne Olympics but eventually a scaled down team, which included Avellán, was sent to compete in Australia. The Melbourne Games were literally life-changing for Avellán. Firstly, she was chosen for the honour of carrying her national flag at the opening ceremony, and she then threw well in the discus and her position of sixth has never been bettered by an Argentine thrower through 2020. Two days before the Games ended, Avellán met Australian businessman Frank De Neefe, and five days later, on the day the Argentines were about to leave for home, she accepted his proposal of marriage. The two were to remain together for half a century until his death in 2007. The couple corresponded by letter until 1958 when her fiancée travelled to Uruguay to see her win the shot and discus double at the South American Championships. The pair travelled back to Australia where they settled in Melbourne. She joined the South Melbourne club where she was coached by the legendary Austrian Franz Stampfl.

A Southern Californian, Lynch considered the entire ABLA to be run by Northeast clubs. He organized a group that manufactured a large number of paper clubs and submitted their application to the ABLA. This put them in the majority and allowed them to take over the ABLA administration. Eventually this was settled when the ABLA Constitution was amended to provide for election on a geographic basis, dividing the country into three regions – East, Central, and West, with an equal number of directors. Lynch, who owned a bike shop in Westwood, California, was eventually named to the ABLA board, but the rebellious effort came at a cost, as he lost his job and his marriage.

Stevenson won a gold medal at the 2001 World Championship and silvers at the 2001 and 2004 European Championships but her Athens Olympic campaign once again ended in disappointment when she lost a close decision in her first fight. Stevenson continued to add to her medal collection by placing second at the 2005 World Championships and winning the European title in both 2005 and 2006. Returning to the Olympic arena for a third time in Beijing she appeared to have suffered another heartbreaking defeat at the hands of a Chinese rival in the last eight of the competition. In a decision without precedent in the history of taekwondo an appeals committee ruled, on video evidence, that she unfairly denied two points which would have won her the match. After being reinstated into the competition she went on to win the bronze medal. She added another European Championship in 2010 before winning the world welterweight title for the first time in 2011. Stevenson took the oath on behalf of the athletes at the 2012 London Olympics but could not add another medal to go with her Beijing bronze.

He had two earlier world records to his credit, the first coming in the 1932 Olympic final when the winner, Bob Tisdall of Eire, was debarred from having his time of 51.7 recognized because he knocked over the last hurdle and the record went to Hardin, who ran 51.9 in second place, although the IAAF rounded it up to 52.0 for record purposes, and this equalled Morgan Taylor’s 1928 world record but Hardin made the record his own by winning the 1934 AAU in 51.8. While at LSU, Hardin won the 440y flat and the low hurdles at the NCAA in 1933 and 1934; he also won the AAU intermediate hurdles in both those years.

2000638,Carlos Botelho,Male,18 September 1899,,, Portugal,POR,"As a painter, illustrator, cartoonist and satirist Carlos Botelho was one of the most important Portuguese artists of his generation. The child of musicians, he attended art school in Lisboa, but quit before graduating and remained largely an autodidact. From 1926-29, he drew comics in the children’s weekly ABCzinho and in 1928, he started a satirical comic page for the weekly Sempre Fixe. This cooperation lasted for 22 years continuously. A visit to Paris in 1929 brought Botelho to painting. In 1930, he set up his first studio in Lisboa, in the residence of his wife, a teacher. The location of this house in the old town, where he lived until 1949, also influenced his choice of artistic subjects. During this period, he was part also of a team of decorators who designed the official Portuguese pavilions at major exhibitions for the National Information Secretariat (SNI), such as the “small” World’s Fair “Arts et Techniques dans la Vie Moderne” in Paris (1937), the International Exhibitions in New York and San Francisco (1939) and the World’s Fair in Lisbon (1940). Therefore, Botelho spent six months in the USA in 1939. In 1937, he became more familiar in Paris with the work of van Gogh, which strongly influenced him and gave his work an expressionist orientation in the early years. In 1949, he moved to his own house in Buzano, near Lisboa, but returned to the center of the city in 1955. In 1969, Botelho retired from the SNI after almost 30 years. The motifs of his paintings were urban landscapes, mainly of Lisboa but also of other cities in Europe and the United States that he got to know. As a contrast to his humorous works, he also devoted himself to social themes and painted, for instance, acrobats, blind people and fishermen. Eventually, he added portraits of family members. With time, Botelho turned away from his expressionist-influenced style and approached abstraction in the 1950s, for example in the formal structuring of urban landscapes. He exhibited, amongst others, at several biennials in Venice and São Paulo. At the Olympic Art Exhibition in Helsinki in 1952, Botelho presented three oil paintings: The Quays of Belém are shown in the catalog. Candidates for his Snow on the Serra da Estrela - created in 1938 according to the catalog – are the paintings Serra da Estrela and Untitled (both in oil on wood). These are dated, however, from 1933. The Serra da Estrela (Star Mountains) is with almost 2,000 m the highest mountain range of the Portuguese mainland. It is also home to the country’s only ski resort.",

Pett, who won three NCU titles at 50 miles, also competed in the Olympic road race in Athens and, in view of his NCU successes, was the favorite for the 84 km. event but he suffered a bad fall and failed to finish. In addition to his Olympic gold medal and his NCU victories, Pett finished second to Leon Meredith in the 100 km. at the 1904 World Championships but his greatest performance came at Herne Hill in September 1908 when he set a British tandem-pace record for one hour of 30 miles, 1,170 yards. This record withstood every attack for 20 years and it was not until 1928 that the great Frank Southall covered a greater distance inside the space of 60 minutes. Billy Pett did not take up cycling until the age of 20 and in his early days he was associated with Southern CC and Putney AC before joining the Norwood Paragon club.

Pett achieved all these successes despite the inhibitions imposed on him by his work.

Between 1920 and 1928 he won a record nine Olympic gold medals (six individual; three team) and three individual silver medals. His medals came in a wide range of events: 1,500 metres, 3,000 metres (team), 5,000 metres, 10,000 metres, steeplechase and cross-country. In 1932, he was banned for alleged professionalism and missed the chance to add the 1932 marathon, for which he was one of the favorites, to his list of Olympic successes. Although subsequently reinstated as an amateur for domestic races, he continued to be excluded from international competition, a decision that left him embittered for the rest of his life. However, he returned to the Olympic arena in 1952 when he carried the torch into the Opening Ceremony. The incomparable “Flying Finn” set 22 official and 13 unofficial world records, and statues (done by Wäinö Aaltonen in 1925) honoring his feats stand in his hometown of Turku, outside the Olympic stadium in Helsinki, and in the park of the Olympic Museum in Lausanne.

In the 1936 unofficial Hungarian championship, which was the qualifier for the Olympic team, he won first place alongside Gábor Cseh in the K2 10,000 metres, so they earned the right to start the Olympics, albeit at their own expense. Due to brief preparation, they finished last in both in 1000 and 10000 metres. At the end of his sporting career in 1941, Gelle founded the kayak division of the BSZKRT, and his pupils won the Hungarian championships multiple times. The recognition of his work is indicated by the fact that he was the first Hungarian coach to receive an offer abroad: in 1949 he laid the foundations for Soviet kayak-canoe sport in Moskva. After his return, Gelle worked in the kayak division of Budapest Elöre for three years, then from 1953 coached at the Újpest Dózsa and became the coach of the national team. As a coach, the first great success of the Hungarian kayak-canoe team, the 1954 World Championships in Macon, is credited to Gelle’s leadership, from which they returned home with six gold medals. In 1960, he took part in the Rome Olympics as head coach, where his competitors won one gold, three silver, and two bronze medals. In 1961, he was awarded the title of master coach for his outstanding work. In 1968 he compiled a handbook entitled Kayaking, Canoeing, which also contained international rules.",

Highly distressed, she sought help with her father who soon settled the matter when the accusations appeared to be unknown to the organization. Following her Alpine skiing career, she became an administrator with the International Ski Federation (FIS) and was a skiing official at two Olympics.

Masterkova made it to the 1991 World Championships, where she finished eighth in the 800, but that was her only major international event prior to the 1996 Olympics, due to injuries and childbirth. At the 1996 Olympics, Masterkova was not considered as the top favorite in the 800, with Maria Mutola and Ana Fidelia Quirot expected to battle for 800 gold. But Masterkova took the lead from the start, and led the entire race to become Olympic champion. After this surprise, Masterkova caused a major upset by also winning the 1,500 in a similar fashion, thereby equalling Tatyana Kazankina’s performance at the 1976 Olympics. She completed her season by setting two world records in the 1,000 metres (2:28.98) and mile (4:12.56). Masterkova missed the next season again due to injuries, but returned in 1998 to win a European 1,500 metre title. At the 1999 World Championships, Masterkova won the 1,500 title, but had to settle for a bronze in the 800.

He also attended the Tokyo School of Fine Arts to study western painting but dropped out before graduating. Yamaguchi took part in various exhibitions with his prints, but also produced oil paintings presented at the Emperor, Koufukai and Pacific Ocean Artists’ Association Exhibitions, among others. He later became a member of the staff of the higher education supervision and also taught painting. He continued to produce prints as well as oil paintings and in 1927 had his first exhibition abroad in Los Angeles. Yamaguchi became a member of the Japanese Creative Prints Society. After retirement from his administrative job, he returned to his home district and the town of Ina and concentrated on producing art. He became known for woodcuts showing the mountains of the Nagano region. His woodcuts were known for their combination of carved blur and printing blur, creating a unique style combining power and softness. At the age of 86, Yamaguchi died in the Tenryu River Hospital in Ina from acute pneumonia. In 1932, Yamaguchi entered Mr. Mikio Oda Holding ‘The Crown Prince Cup’. The Cup was donated in 1918 by the regent and later emperor Hirohito to the winner in a sumo competition. The sheet is a woodcut, printed on paper in the format 60.0 x 38.0 cm.

81471,Nancy Kerrigan,Female,13 October 1969,162.0,52, United States,USA,"Nancy Kerrigan won two Olympic medals in figure skating, a bronze in 1992, and a silver in 1994. If only that were all to her story. Kerrigan first competed internationally at the 1991 World Championships, where she received a bronze medal. In 1992, she moved up at the US Nationals, winning her first major title, which qualified her for the Olympic team, where she finished behind American gold medalist Kristi Yamaguchi. With Yamaguchi turning professional after the 1992 Olympics, Kerrigan appeared poised to move up to the top spot in world figure skating. Her greatest competition in the US seemed to come from Tonya Harding, who had been fourth at the Albertville Olympics. Harding did not fit well into the figure skating world, coming from a poor family. She hunted and fished, was an accomplished auto mechanic, played pool, smoked cigarettes, and was completely outside the skating establishment. Kerrigan was not from a wealthy family either, but had more community support. Beautiful, quiet, and classy, Kerrigan started to reap the rewards of the more traditional skating world, and received several commercial endorsements, which helped ease her family’s economic concerns. Harding was getting none of this and she saw one way out. To get endorsements and money, she had to win the gold medal in Lillehammer and to her that meant eliminating Kerrigan as a competitor. Harding was then married to Jeff Gillooly. Gillooly contacted a friend, Shawn Eckardt, asking how a hit could be arranged on Kerrigan, disabling her for the Olympics. Eckardt eventually contacted Derrick Smith, who hired his nephew, Shane Stant, who agreed to attack Kerrigan and injure her leg. The group finally settled on attacking Kerrigan at the US Nationals in Detroit. Shortly before the competition, Kerrigan came off the ice after a training session, when a large man assaulted her with a solid-metal baton, hitting her just above the knee. The assailant was Stant, who escaped by running out of the arena to a getaway car. Kerrigan collapsed, crying out, “Why? Why me?” She could not skate at the Nationals. Two days later, Tonya Harding won the US Nationals and qualified for the Olympic team. The US had only two spots for the ladies’ event in Lillehammer. The second spot could go to Michelle Kwan, who finished second to Harding. But the US figure skating authorities held the spot open for Kerrigan, if she could show that she could recover in time for the Winter Olympics. Kwan graciously stepped aside and Kerrigan did recover in time to be named to the Winter Olympic team. Eventually Harding and her mob was caught, and she would be fined and sentenced to community service and she has had a difficult life since that episode. At Lillehammer, a media frenzy surrounded the women’s figure skating because of the “Kardigan Saga.” In Norway, Kerrigan skated beautifully, but lost out by the narrowest of margins to Ukrainian Oksana Bayul, earning a silver medal. Kerrigan married her agent, Jerry Solomon, whom she had become close to during the controversial episode. She skated professionally a bit, but mostly raised three children with Solomon in their hometown in Massachusetts. Nancy Kerrigan also started The Nancy Kerrigan Foundation for the visually impaired, honoring her mother, who was legally blind, and could barely see well enough to watch her daughter’s elegant skating.",Listed in Olympians Who Acted in Movies (Small part in Blades of Glory.)
