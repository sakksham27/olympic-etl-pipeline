After falling during a triple axel jump at the 1996 World Championships, he pulled off the first quadruple toe loop-triple toe loop in international competition and managed to finish in 4th place. He regained the world title for a final time in 1997. Stojko experienced a groin injury, as well as a bout with the flu, in 1998 prior to that year’s Winter Olympics. Although he managed to win a second silver medal at the tournament, he severely strained the injury and decided not to attend that year’s World Championships. He placed fourth, second and tenth at the 1999, 2000 and 2001 World Championships respectively and did not skate at the latter year’s Canadian Championships. He regained the Canadian title a final time in 2002, but placed only 8th at the Winter Olympics and decided to turn professional. He skated for four more years before retiring in 2006.

He made his début in the Danish top flight league in 1957 for Vejle, switching to AGF in 1962. In this period, he won the league title in 1958 and the Danish Cup in 1958, 1959 and 1965. In 1958, he débuted internationally against Curaçao, scoring twice in his first international match. He would eventually collect 54 caps, scoring 29 times. The latter figure made him one of the more successful strikers in Danish history, and at the time of his death he was still ranked 7th among most scoring Danish internationals. In the 1960 Olympics, Enoksen and the Danish squad exceeded expectations, beating defending champion Hungary en route to a silver medal. Enoksen was also selected for the Danish Euro 1964 squad, but did not actually play during the tournament. Following his retirement from top football in 1967, Enoksen continue to play with amateur side Tønder SF, first as player/manager, later as manager only.

Later he studied at the School of Applied Arts in Wien (Vienna) (1913-1914) and the Academy of Fine Arts in Zagreb (1919-1920). His stone and wooden busts and portraits, as well as his allegorical compositions and grave stones, were initially produced in the spirit of Art Nouveau, but were later directed more to expressionism and critical realism. An essential part of Škarpa’s work was sacral-themed plastics, often carried out by clerical orders. Due to political developments and since he was not in line with public and critical tastes, he lacked recognition for a long time. He suffered especially for decades under the opposition of sculptor Ivan Meštrović (1883 – 1962).",

In contention for the medals coming down the final straight he mistimed his leap at the final hurdle, lost momentum and slipped back to sixth. In the next four years he continued his improvement and, in addition to winning 440 y hurdles and relay gold medals at the 1958 British Empire Games. set three world records at 440 y hurdles. A potential meeting between Potgieter and a trio of high class Americans led by Glenn Davis shaped up to be one of the highlights of the 1960 Olympic track and field programme but it was never to take place. A few weeks before the Games began Potgieter was involved in a serious car crash whilst in Germany. He lost the use of an eye in the accident and the vision in the other was also damaged. On the day of the 400 m hurdles final he was still recuperating in a Heidelberg hospital. He recovered well enough to compete in the decathlon and won the 1966 South African title in the event but even if he could have resumed his career at the highest level South Africa had by then been barred from the Olympic Games. Although from the Afrikaner heartland of Pietermaritzburg Potgieter became involved in attempts to desegregate sport in his country and in 1988 helped to found the South African Olympic Academy, a fully non-racial body.

It was said, that in his big, blue helmet he looked like a bump on two legs, hence the nickname Bulan. Lars-Börje grew up in a family of ski enthusiasts. His mother was Eivor Berglund from Åre, an alpine skier who competed at the 1956 Cortina Olympic Games. As a 10-year-old he already placed third in the national Donald Duck Cup in 1976. Living in Stockholm, his home slope was the 45 m high Sundbyberg’s Hill. Therefore, he started with slalom until he came to the Järpen ski gymnasium in 1982. In 1987 he was a surprise Swedish champion in super-G. Two more national titles were to follow in 1989 in the downhill and giant slalom. In January 1988 he finished sixth and eighth in two World Cup races in downhill just before the Olympics, and at the 1988 Calgary Olympics won the bronze medal in the first ever Olympic super-G. In one of the downhill training runs in Calgary, he only saved himself by going up onto the safety net and slid 10-20 meters along it, before he turned onto the course again and continued, a classic video sequence at the time. He became the first Swedish skier ever to win a super-G in the World Cup, winning the Aspen race in February 1989. His second World Cup win was a giant-slalom in the same season in Thredbo, Australia. Eriksson’s career was successful but short. In the downhill race of the 1991 World Championships in Saalbach, he fell and broke his leg. In the course of the subsequent operation, the doctors put in overly long nails. When the leg healed together the nail migrated into the knee. From this Eriksson contracted a chronic inflammation. He was faced with the choice to either have a risky new operation, to be able to continue competitive skiing, or to stop. He retired from active sports and moved to Åre to become CEO of a company working to develop the town as a tourist destination.",Son of Eivor Berglund

69544,Bruce Tulloh,Male,29 September 1935,171.0,54, Great Britain,GBR,"When he ran in the Inter-Counties championship at the White City in 1959, Bruce Tulloh raised a few eyebrows because he ran barefooted, a sight normally reserved for African runners on British tracks. Tulloh reckoned he could run faster without spikes and, barefooted, he could attain a greater burst of speed. His decision was vindicated he then won his first AAA title, at 3-miles, that same year. Tulloh started running at his prep school, and developed further after going to public school. He won his first race at the age of 12 at the Horwood village sports day in Devon. He then went to Southampton University, where he studied botany and was the 1958 and 1959 UAU 3-mile champion. He was the Southern Counties 3-mile champion in 1959 and, after going up to Selwyn College, Cambridge for one year, became a Blue, winning the one mile at the Varsity meeting. After University, Tulloh got his first job with the Shell company, which took him to Kenya, where he started teaching and coaching athletics and later set up the Safaricom Marathon. One of his pupils in Kenya was Olympic medalist Mike Boit. Tulloh’s victories included the AAA 3-mile title in 1959, 1962-63. He was also runner-up in 1960 and third in 1964. He was narrowly beaten by the legendary Mohamad Gammoudi in the AAA 6-mile race in 1966, when he set the British record of 27:23.78, just 0.4 sec behind the Tunisian. Tulloh also won the Inter-Counties 3-mile title in 1962, and 1964-85 and the 6-mile title in 1962, and 1966-67. In 1962, he finished second to Peter Snell when Snell broke the World mile record at Wanganui, New Zealand. Tulloh led going until the back straight but, despite finishing second, still managed to go on and beat the four-minute barrier for the first time. Tulloh’s proudest track moment, however, was in winning the European Championship 5000 metres title at Budapest, also in 1962. Equally at home cross-country running as he was on the track, Tulloh was twice runner-up in the English National Cross-country Championships, in 1961 and 1962. He lost to Basil Heatley in 1961 and the following year thought he had the race won at Blackpool, when he tried to get away from local hero Gerry North with half-a-mile to go, but the local man was not prepared to be beaten on home soil and won by two seconds. Ironically, the two men would become team-mates in the highly successful Portsmouth AC in the 1960s and 70s. Tulloh competed in the 1960 Rome Olympics, but the heat and humidity beat him. He missed the 1964 Games due to a bout of measles and the prospect of racing at altitude at Mexico in 1968 did not appeal to him so, instead, he took on another challenge. He decided to attack the record of running the 2,876 miles across America form Los Angeles to New York City, and he did it in 64 days 23 hours to beat the old record by more than four days. It was an achievement that later earned him the nickname “The original Forrest Gump.” He wrote about his achievement in a book Four Million Footsteps, which was regarded as one of the best running books of all time. In total, Tulloh had 23 books published including Complete Distance Runner, Running over 40, 50, 60, 70, Running is Easy, and How to Avoid Dying - For as Long as Possible - published just after his 80th birthday. He kept on running long after his competitive days were over, and at the age of 58 ran a 2:47 in the London Marathon, clocking 1:16 for a half-marathon aged 60. For his 75th birthday he ran the original marathon course in Athens, and for his 80th birthday ran, and walked, the 80 miles from his Wiltshire home to London. Tulloh was a biology teacher at Marlborough College for more than 20 years, where he also coached the cross-country team. He had twin daughters, Katherine and Jojo, who were also barefooted runners and both had podium finishes in the 1500 metres at the English Schools Championships. At the time of his death, Tulloh was President of Portsmouth AC.

17862,Édouard de Rothschild,Male,24 February 1868,,, France,FRA,"Édouard de Rothschild was a member of the French banking dynasty, one of the world’s wealthiest families. He was the third child and the only son of Alphonse, who became the co-owner of the family stud farm at Ferrières which was established in 1835. The family acquired 20 acres of land at Meautry, near Deauville, in 1873 and built stables and breeding facilities. On his father’s death in 1905, Édouard inherited his father’s half share of the stables and at the height of his career owned some 80 brood mares and had more than 90 horses in training. One of them, Brantôme, was unbeaten as a two- and three-year-old and won the French Triple Crown and the Prix de l’Arc de Triomphe in 1934. When he died aged 21 in 1952, a newspaper headline read: “Brantôme de Rothschild is dead.” He was probably the greatest French racehorse and was even the subject of a short film entitled: Brantôme: Invincible Horse. Rothschild won the Prix de Diane five times and the Arc on a second occasion with Eclair au Chocolat in 1938. His first Classic success was with Alcantra in the 1911 French Derby. As a youngster Eduardo had to contend with anti-Semitic insults and, following an invasion by the Germans in the early part of World War II, the Rothschild horses were either destroyed, sold in France, or shipped to Germany for breeding. Edouard himself fled to the United States. On his return in 1946 he set about rebuilding Meautry with son Guy, who took over the stables after his father’s death in 1949. Guy continued the family racing tradition, which was then carried on by his son Edouard who took over Meautry after his death in 2007. In addition to owning racehorses and being a good polo player, Rothschild was a director of the family bank and a director of the Bank of France and was also heavily involved in the family’s railway investments. He was also inherited a vast art collection form his father and a share in the Château Lafite vineyard. Like many members of the Rothschild family, Edouard was a good polo player and served as a member of the committee of the Deauville Club and was a bronze medal winner with the Paris Bagatelle Club at the 1900 Olympics.",Listed in Olympian Members of the Nobility (Baron)

After three of four runs, Lechner was third, behind the East Germans Ortrun Enderlein and Anna-Maria Müller and immediately before another East German, Angela Knösel. However, a jury check after the third run revealed that the blades of the toboggans used by the team of East Germany had been heated, an illegal practice which helped reduce friction on the ice, so the three athletes were disqualified and Lechner found herself in first place before the final run, which was initially postponed due to bad weather, but was later canceled, bringing her the gold medal. Another successful year was 1971, when she won the European Championship in Imst and the silver medal at the Worlds in Olang, only narrowly missing first place, beaten by the West German Elisabeth Demleitner. The following year she ended her career after taking part in the 1972 Winter Olympic Games in Sapporo but failed to finish.

The following year his crews were victorious in both events (Weder was allowed to compete despite being caught chipping a “bad lump” of ice off one of the track’s corners), but slid to second place in 1991, with Morell replacing Gerber in the two-man. At the 1992 Winter Olympics, Weder teamed up with Acklin once more and won the two-man event, while coming in third in the four-man with Acklin, Morell, and Schindelholz. Acklin and Weder saw continued success at the 1993 World Championships, where they took silver in the two-man and gold in the four-man (alongside Kurt Meier and Domenico Semeraro), and then defended their Olympic crown in the two-man in 1994, 0.05 seconds ahead of Acklin’s brother Guido and compatriot Reto Götschi.

It would be 76 years before this feat was equaled when Malcolm Cooper won his second gold in 1988. Between 1908 and 1912 Pimm took part in eight events, winning three medals, all in team events. In 1908 he was on the winning small-bore rifle team, 50 and 100 yards. A second gold followed four years later in the small-bore rifle, 50 metres prone, team event, and in the 25 metres disappearing target event he was on the team that won the silver to make up his tally of three medals. In that same silver medal-winning team was his son-in-law William Styles. Pimm was the adjutant of the miniature shooting events for the 1912 Olympics and an interesting article in The Times shows that he was trying to recruit members for the individual 25 and 50 metres events for the British team via the newspaper. The article went on to say that successful applicants would have to undertake to pay their own expenses to Stockholm of around £15, and were invited to write to Pimm at his London address. Pimm was a well known Victorian and Edwardian artist, well known for landscapes and portraits. He trained in Antwerp in 1885 where he met Vincent Van Gogh, and also met his future wife Louise Van Tongelen. Many of his works still sell at auction for several thousand pounds and he was at one time commissioned to paint the portraits of the Lord Mayor of London each year. His works have also hung in the Royal Academy. During World War One he was sent to the front line to draw pictures of the German lines on the Western Front. Pimm emigrated to the United States in 1940 and lived with his daughter in Florida where he died in Dade County in 1952. Before he went to the United States Pimm lived in Sussex, as did his son-in-law William Styles. Both were hired by local golf clubs to shoot rabbits and keep them off the courses and there was a rivalry between the two men to see who could shoot the most each day!",Father-in-law of William Styles

12224,Shunzo Kido,Male,4 July 1889,,, Japan,JPN,"Although he never won a medal, Shunzo Kido can be considered one of the best-known horsemen of his time, at least in the US and his home country Japan. As at Amsterdam in 1928, he mounted his horse Kyu Gun in Los Angeles. The horse, however, was already 19-years-old and therefore initially considered as a reserve. Due to the lack of suitable horses, Kyu Gun had to compete. Kido was placed 12th of 14 riders after the dressage. He had almost completed the cross-country phase when he noted that the horse was sweating profusely and its nostrils were flaring. He dismounted and withdrew from the competition to save the horse’s health or even life. This action was praised by many animal lovers and two plaques commemorating the incident were installed in the US – one at the World Peace Bridge on Mount Rubidoux, California in 1934, and the other at the Riverside Mission Inn. The story, however, was blown up by the press, saying that only one more successful jump would have been necessary to win the gold medal, which was far from the truth. In 1964, the plaque from the Mission Inn and the saddle that Kido used in Los Angeles were presented to Japan and are on display at the Prince Chichibu Memorial Sports Museum in Tokyo. Shunzo Kido graduated from the Military Academy to become a cavalry officer and represented Japan in eventing at the 1928 and 1932 Olympics. At the latter, he was captain of the Japanese equestrian team. He returned to the Army Cavalry School and became an equestrian instructor. In 1934, he joined the Imperial Household and taught horseback riding to the Emperor and to Crown Prince Akihito. After the war, he served as an instructor at the former Imperial Palace Equestrian Club and as a managing director of the Japanese Equestrian Federation. He also promoted horse breeding and developing a training facility for the Olympic equestrian team in Tono City, Iwate. When a monument to the horses that were killed in the war, approximately 1,000,000, was to be erected at the Yasukuni Shrine, sculpted by Kunio Ito, funds ran out and the project was postponed. Kide took the initiative to collect money mainly from veterans and the War Horse Memorial was unveiled in 1958.",

An excellent shot, he was selected for the British squad at the 1908 Olympics and won a gold medal as part of the team that won the trap event. In the individual competition, Postans was one of three Britons, along with Charles Palmer and Richard Hutton, who tied for first place on 23 points after the first round of shooting. However, the Canadian team put in an objection to the first round scores and they were allowed to shoot again with one of them, the eventual gold medalist, Walter Ewing taking the lead on 27. Postans withdrew, probably in disgust at the Canadian objection, and thus failed to take part in the second and third rounds of the competition.",

He was then selected for the 1964 Summer Olympics and entered into eight events, of which his seventh-place finish in the 200 metre backstroke was the only one in which he made it beyond the opening round. His breakout year came in 1966, however, when he won eight medals at the British Empire and Commonwealth Games: gold in the 4×110 yard medley relay, silver in the 4×110 and 4×220 yard freestyle relays, as well as the 110 and 220 yard backstroke events and the 440 yard individual medley, and bronze in the 440 and 1650 yard freestyle events. He barely slowed down at the 1967 Pan American Games, capturing gold in the 200 m backstroke and silver in the 200, 400, and 1500 m freestyle events, as well as the 4×100 and 4×200 m freestyle relays. Shortly before the 1968 Summer Olympics, where he won silver in the 400 m freestyle event behind Mike Burton of the United States, he set a world record in the event with a time of 4:06.5, one that would last for over a year until it was broken by Hans Faßnacht of West Germany. Hutton also placed fourth, fourth, fifth, and seventh in the 200 m freestyle, 4×200 m freestyle relay, 1,500 m freestyle, and 4×100 m freestyle relay respectively. Hutton was still a successful swimmer at the turn of the decade, earning silver in the 200 and 400 m freestyle, as well as the 4×100 and 4×200 m freestyle relays at the 1970 Commonwealth Games. His final major international medals came at the 1971 Pan American Games, where he took silver in the 4×200 m freestyle relay (with Ron Jacks, Bob Kasting, and Brian Phillips) and bronze in the 200 and 400 m freestyle events. He then attended the 1972 Summer Olympics, finishing seventh in the 4×200 m freestyle relay and eighth in the 200 m freestyle, and being eliminated in the opening round of the 400 m freestyle. He retired from active competition after the Games and eventually became a member of the Vancouver Police Department, in addition to remaining active in coaching. He has been inducted into the British Columba Sports (1973), Canada’s Sports (1977), and the International Swimming (1984) Halls of Fame, as well as Swimming Canada’s Circle of Excellence (2011).","Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the Summer Pan American Games (1–7–3 1963 São Paulo SWI silver: 4×200 m freestyle relay, bronze: 1500 m freestyle; 1967 Winnipeg SWI gold: 200 m backstroke, silver: 200 m freestyle, 400 m freestyle, 1500 m freestyle, 4×100 m freestyle relay, and 4×200 m freestyle relay; 1971 Cali SWI silver: 4×200 m freestyle relay, bronze: 200 m freestyle and 400 m freestyle) Listed in Olympians Who Set a World Record in Long Course Swimming (400 m freestyle – 1 August 1968 - 14 August 1969: 4:06.5 (1 August 1968; Lincoln, USA)) Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the British Empire/Commonwealth Games (1–9–2 1966 Kingston SWI gold: 4×110 yards medley, silver: 110 yards backstroke, 220 yards backstroke, 440 yards medley, 4×110 yards freestyle, and 4×220 yards freestyle, bronze: 440 yards freestyle, and 1650 yards freestyle; 1970 Edinburgh SWI silver: 200 m freestyle, 400 m freestyle, 4×100 m freestyle, and 4×200 m freestyle)"

921002,Kamezo Shimizu,Male,30 March 1875,,, Japan,JPN,"Kamezo Shimizu was a Japanese metal artist and sculptor, who specialized in the Shakudo technique, which is a traditional surface-treated alloy with dark colors painted on metal. He developed significant refinements of this technique during the Meiji period (1868-1912) and published them in 1937 in the Japanese monograph Methods and Techniques of Metalworking. Shimizu liked painting since he was a child. Thus, he enrolled in the painting department of the Tokyo School of Fine Arts but later switched to the engraving department, from which he graduated in 1896. He continued his studies under Fujita Bunzō and was encouraged to pursue his own artistic activities. Later Shimizu served as a teacher at Takamatsu Crafts School in the Kagawa Prefecture but had to retire because of illness. He then studied antique works of art in the former capital Nara. Shimizu returned to Tokyo where he was appointed professor at the Tokyo School of Fine Arts, holding that position until 1945. During this time, he was an artist for the Imperial Household and chairman of the metal engraving section of the Imperial Art Academy and contributed greatly to the development of the engraving industry. His works were widely exhibited, amongst others at the Imperial Exhibitions. He also fostered his sister’s grandson, the famous Japanese painter Ikuo Hirayama, when he was a child. Just weeks before the end of World War II, Shimizu was evacuated to his hometown and decided to retire from his post. Immediately after the war supplies of material and tools were poor and hindered creative activities. He eventually died of peritonitis. His inkstone screen with the title Wrestling with one arm entered in 1936 consists of forged silver with inlaid copper. Its height is 18 cm, the diameter 19 cm. These screens should prevent the ink from evaporating due to draft after grinding in water.",

2000570,Mihajlo Jancović,Male,1911,,, Yugoslavia,YUG,"Mihajlo Janković was one of the most important representatives of post-war Yugoslav architecture and made a great contribution to the reconstruction of Beograd (Belgrade). In 1936 he graduated from the Faculty of Technology in Beograd with a degree in architecture. After working in the military construction offices, Janković founded his own studio “Stadion”, which he managed until his death in 1976. His projects for sports stadiums, such as Stadium JNA and Stadium “Tašmajdan,” deserve special mention. His major projects for the state and the Communist Party, including the Palace of the Federation and the Palace of the Central Committee of the SKJ, earned him the unofficial title of the “Palace Architect” of the Tito regime, although Janković never became a member of the party. His style was modern and internationally recognized. Janković’s father was also an architect. The Partizan Stadium is a football and athletics stadium in Beograd, originally named JNA Stadium (Stadium of the Yugoslav People’s Army). Mihajlo Janković and Kosta Popović were still little known as architects, and it came as a surprise when they were awarded the contract. They followed the principles of functionalism. Construction of the stadium began in 1948, and it was officially opened in the following year with an international football match between Yugoslavia and France. It was not completed, however, until 1951. The stadium originally had a capacity of about 55,000 spectators. After renovation, it was reduced to about 30,000 seats due to new security regulations. The pitch measures 105 x 70 meters and the stands have 30 rows of seats with 30 entrances for spectators.",

At the time the two were both police officers, but their careers would take decidedly different courses. Wood eventually became New South Wales (NSW) Police Commissioner in 1976, but stepped down in 1979, partly because of his association with Riley who had by then turned to a life of crime. Riley joined the NSW police force in 1943, when only 17-years-old, and he eventually rose to detective-sergeant, 3rd class. Major drug investigations in the 1960s found that Riley was associated with managers of several illegal gambling casinos in Sydney and Wollongong and it led to his involvement in drugs. In 1966 he was jailed for a year in New Zealand on charges of attempting to bribe a police inspector, after he was found to be involved in drug importation and cashing stolen American Express checks. After his release he linked up with well-known Australian crime figure Wally Dean and the two became supervisors for the Sydney League Clubs, and began scamming the clubs, extorting their services at very high fees in return for protection. Riley disappeared for a few years but emerged in September 1974, helping Dean in an unsuccessful attempt to get elected to the South Sydney City Council. Riley was also involved in the Nugan Hand Bank Scandal, which was a complex arrangement fronted by the United States CIA, and former US Green Beret Michael Hand, as a front to help catch drug dealers and exporters. It was found that in April 1976, Nugan Hand made cash transfers to Riley in Hong Kong, totaling about $1.2 million. Riley used the cash to take delivery of heroin shipments. The Australian Joint Task Force on Drugs, concluded, “Throughout 1976 Hand was knowingly involved in drug activity with the ‘Riley’ group in that he permitted and even encouraged the use of Nugan Hand facilities for the movement of drug money.” Riley was finally caught in June 1978, when he was arrested after 4.3 tons of cannabis was found onboard the yacht Anoa at Polkington Reef, east of Papua New Guinea. Riley pleaded guilty and was sentenced by Judge Kenneth Torrington to 5-10 years in jail. The sentence was extended 7 years when he was found to have defrauded American Express of $274,000. Riley was released in May 1984, having served only 6 of 17 years. He soon became involved with drugs again, attempting to smuggle over 50 kg of heroin from Papua New Guinea to distribute in Australia. In October 1984, Riley came into the employ of Lennie McPherson, noted drug dealer, looking after collections from various gambling clubs and bookmakers, and providing protection for them. By the early 1990s Riley had changed his name to Murray Lee Stewart by deed poll. In October 1990 Riley/Stewart and Jonathan Nicholas Gould were arrested in Great Britain for conspiring to defraud British Aerospace PLC of £40,000,000 via computer fraud. They were convicted in July 1991 and sentenced to five years in prison. Riley had many friends and he was sent to an open prison farm at Spring Hill Prison in Aylesbury, which he simply walked out of in December 1991. He remained at large for eight weeks, traveling in Northern Ireland, Spain and Belgium before being recaptured in January 1992. He was moved to a minimum security prison in Kent, and escaped from there, with IRA help, in January 1993, settling in Hong Kong, where he lived incognito, before returning to Queensland, Australia in early 1994. In January 2008, historian Dr. John Jiggens of the Queensland University of Technology, deepened the crime connection of Riley with the publication of his book The Sydney Connection: Nugan Hand, Murray Riley, and the Murder of Donald Mackay. Mackay was a furniture store owner in the NSW town of Griffith, who in 1975, tipped off police about a large marijuana plantation at Coleambally, south of Griffith. Mackay was murdered outside the Hotel Griffith on 15 July 1977, as his bloodstained car and spent .22 cartridges were found in the hotel carpark the next day, although his body was never recovered. Jiggens notes in the book that Nugan and Riley were key figures in an international drug-smuggling group supplying the United States market in the 1970s.",Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the British Empire/Commonwealth Games (2–0–0 1950 Auckland ROW gold: double sculls; 1954 Vancouver ROW gold: double sculls) Listed in Olympians Who Were Sent to Prison (In 1966 he was jailed for a year in New Zealand on charges of attempting to bribe a police inspector.

He was a noted typical Italian expressionist, but sent in several rather neo-cubist works depicting track cycling, and Fausto Coppi in particular. Stradone was an avid cyclist himself. Later his style showed an increasing degree of abstraction, eventually only reflecting moods and feelings. As a youngster living in Rome, he often went to the Borghese Museum, copying the works of old masters like Raphael. After graduating from high school, he studied law following his parents’ wishes but never worked in this field. At the same time he also developed a keen interest in entomology. Initially, he belonged to the so-called “Roman School” before he had his breakthrough in the 1940s as an expressionist. In 1950 he created a scandal by exhibiting his painting “L’apoteosi di Bartali”, another famous Italian cyclist, at the Biennale in Venezia. Later, he was rediscovered as a member of the “Roman School”. His last major exhibitions were held in between 1978 and 1981, shortly before his sudden death. The successful oil painting is shown in the catalog of art competitions. Therefore, there is no doubt about its identity, although on the official website of the artist, his family states that the 1948 neo-cubist work Coppi in Pista was the one awarded silver in the art competitions. Another entry was the pen and wash drawing Cyclist, which is also represented in the catalog. A line drawing with the same title could not be identified.",

In 1995 Reich switched to piloting and, by 1997, was competing at the World Championships once again, where he won a silver medal in the four-man. He was disqualified, however, alongside the first- and third-placing Swiss teams, for competing with a bobsled that the national team had been using all season, unaware that it was illegal. At the 1998 Winter Olympics he was fourth in the two-man with Cédric Grand and seventh in the four-man alongside Grand, Steve Anderhub, and Thomas Handschin, before taking silver in the two-man with Urs Aeberhard at the 1999 European Championships. Reich’s career really took off in 2000, when he was overall World Cup champion in the two-man and runner-up in the combined. He and Aeberhard also captured bronze in the two- and four-man events at the World Championships, with the assistance of non-Olympians Bruno Aeberhard and Domenic Keller in the latter. In 2001 Reich and Anderhub were runners-up in the two-man at the European Championships and, in 2002, won that title. Reich was also runner-up in the combined and third in the two- and four-man in the World Cup standings that season, but his greatest success came at that year’s Winter Olympics, where he and Anderhub won silver in the two-man. They also came in sixth in the four-man alongside Urs Aeberhard and Guido Acklin. Reich retired from active competition shortly thereafter and worked as head coach of the Monégasque national team until 2006.

5748,Doodie Bloomfield,Male,8 August 1918,,, Canada,CAN,"A lifelong basketball player, Doodie Bloomfield first gained prominence as a star player with the Workers Sport of the Mount Royal Independent Basketball League in 1936. The following year he joined the junior squad of the Young Men’s Hebrew Association in Montreal and helped bring them to the national finals, where they finished runner-up to the Ontario provincial champions. After a year at the intermediate level he advanced to the varsity team in 1939 and brought them their first city championship in their 21-year history. That year it was the senior “Blues” that made it to the national finals, but they too had to settle for second place against the Vancouver Maple Leafs. World War II arrived soon after and Bloomfield quickly signed up with the Royal Canadian Air Force, but he continued to make the most of his talents by playing on the RCAF’s basketball squad. When the conflict ended he was honourably discharged and returned to the YMHA, helping the Blues become a dominant force in Canadian basketball. Although his squad lost to Vancouver in the national championships, such was Bloomfield’s prowess and reputation on the court that he was selected as one of the few members of Canada’s 1948 Olympic basketball delegation not to have played for the University of British Columbia. At that year’s Summer Games the Canadians did not reach the quarter-finals and placed ninth in the classification rounds. Upon his return from London the senior Blues finally captured the national championship in 1949, but the sport was beginning to take its toll and Bloomfield played many games in pain. He edged closer to retirement, declining an invitation to represent Canada at the 1950 Maccabiah Games, but his place in Canadian basketball history was assured: he had twice won the Ben Hockenstein Most Valuable Player Award (1947 and 1950) and was voted nationally as one of the best players of the first half of the 20th century. His sudden death on November 14, 1950, at the age of 32, shocked the amateur sporting world and memorial clubs and awards were quickly established in his honour. The YMHA retried his number, 8, in 1951 to preserve his legacy not only as an astounding player, but as an exceptional sportsman as well.",

Raised in a wealthy and politically engaged anti-fascist family, she later supported the Cuban revolutionary leader Fidel Castro. At only 15-years-of-age, she married the Italian nobleman Giuseppe Antamoro, so she could obtain Italian citizenship. Aged 24, she began to publish short stories and poems, and four years later her first novel was published. In 1935 and 1943, she was detained in Italy for her anti-Fascist activities for partisan organizations. Her radio pseudonym, “Clorinda”, was also her nom de guerre as a partisan. After the liberation, she published the literary magazine “Mercurio” from 1944-48. Later she wrote for “Epoca” and “La Stampa”, before she focused on writing novels. Some of her stories were made into movies including the Michelangelo Antonioni-directed Le amiche. From the late 1960s, she lived in Paris. Her entry for the 1936 Olympic art competitions was the novel lo, suo padre: : romanzo sportivo, which was published in 1935 by a small publishing house in Lanciano.

He studied art in London at the School of Animal Painting, among others. In World War I, Edwards served in the cavalry and then drew for Punch and other publications. Over his life he wrote almost 30 books about hunting and illustrated many more. His father died when he was only seven and left Edwards with a deep love of enthusiastic fox hunting. Edwards submitted three watercolors in his first participation in the art contests in 1928. In 1929 he published his Scottish Sketchbook. For this, he used a watercolor with anglers, possibly Fishing, Scotland. Leaping the fence - an Irish point-to-point (pencil, watercolor and gouache, 25,3 x 27,4 cm) could be another one of the three. Point-to-points are cross-country horse races over fences that are especially popular in Ireland. The Fernie is a traditional hunt in Leicestershire, named after Charles Fernie, who held the post of Master for 31 years. There is a number of pictures of this hunt from this period. Reduced prints were made from originals, some of which were signed by the artist. Edwards’ works from the 1932 art competitions could both be identified. The end of 40 minutes also shows a scene from the Fernie Hunt (51 x 76 cm). Reduced prints of the original also exist. The artist painted a whole series of the Devon and Somerset Staghounds. One painting of the series dated 1930 bears the subtitle The signal to the pack (oil on canvas, 51 x 62 cm). Of the works submitted in 1948, Buck Hunting is shown in the catalog. Edwards created several paintings for the Burghley family, which have their place in the family gallery. Probably, the submitted work was Lord Burghley out Riding to Hounds, a watercolor with gouache (36.8 cm x 76.8 cm), dated 1938. Lord Burghley went out hunting all his life leading several packs of hounds.",

Her father died there and when her mother returned to England in 1920 Hudson, by then known as Millie, took up swimming and diving. Many local newspapers of the day referred to her as being a South African swimmer. She got a job as a typist in Kensington, London, and joined the Hammersmith Ladies Swimming Club. She qualified for the 1924 Olympic springboard competition after winning the Olympic trial at Blackpool ahead of Catherine O’Bryen and Gladys Luscombe. Despite none of the British entrants reaching the final, Hudson was again the highest-placed of the three. Because she suffered many injuries as a diver, Hudson turned to long-distance swimming after the Olympics, and in 1927 gave up her typing job to concentrate on training for her bid to become the first English girl to swim the English Channel. Sadly, after 13 hours in the water, she had to abandon her attempt about two miles away from Dover as a result of choppy waters, and the wind and tide against her. Shortly before her Channel swim, she had made an unsuccessful bid to swim the Straits of Gibraltar. Hudson went to Canada as a swimming coach in 1927, but returned after six years and became a freelance journalist and was also the swimming editor of the London Evening Standard. In 1949 she became the first female member of the Sports Writers Association, and remained their only female member until 1955.

72102,Ennio Preatoni,Male,11 December 1944,184.0,82, Italy,ITA,"Ennio Preatoni was an Italian sprinter in the 1960s and early part of the 70s. He competed at three Olympic Games (1964-72) and, in each edition, reached the final of 4x100 metres relay. At Mexico City in 1968, he was eliminated in the heats of his only individual participation, in the 100 metres. Preatoni also appeared at two European Championships. He finished eighth in the 200 metres in 21.7 at Budapest in 1966, in a race that saw the 1960 Olympic champion Livio Berruti finish just one place ahead of him. Five years later at Helsinki, Preatoni won a bronze medal with the sprint relay team in 38.80 behind Czechoslovakia and Poland. He also won a bronze in the 100 metres at the 1967 Mediterranean Games, behind the winner Charis Ayvaliotis of Greece, and his own team-mate Pasquale Giannattasio. At the same Games Preatoni won gold in the relay in 40.65 with Carlo Laverda, Giannattasio and Ito Giani. This gold was repeated four years later when Preatoni, Vincenzo Guerini, Pasqualino Abeti and Pietro Mennea won in 39.7. Domestically, Preatoni’s finest moment was probably when he set the Italian 100 metres record of 10.2 on 30 May 1970 at Madrid. He was Italian champion in 1968 (10.4) and 1970 (10.6), and after his active career, joined the sprint section of the Italian Athletics Federation (FIDAL), in the days when Mennea reigned supreme. Many talented sprinters like Mauro Zuliani, Gianfranco Lazzer, Carlo Simionato, Pier-francesco Pavoni and Stefano Tilli were developed and they helped provided the nucleus of the relay squad that won the silver medal behind the Americans at the inaugural World Championships at Helsinki in 1983. Preatoni stopped training after the tragic death of his daughter Sara in a car accident while he was at the Barcelona Olympics. Every year in her memory he organised a contest for young musicians. In more recent times Preatoni was teaching the theory and practice of individual sports at the Università Cattolica at Milano.

By 1956 he was a spare on their coxed eights crew, alongside Donald Arnold, Walter D’Hondt, and Archie MacKinnon. As part of their training, this quartet was sent to compete in the coxless fours event at the Canadian Olympic trials, where they surprisingly won the right to represent Canada at the 1956 Summer Games. At the Olympics they took gold in the coxless fours, nearly ten seconds ahead of the Americans. Their next stop was the 1958 British Empire and Commonwealth Games, where they earned gold as members of the eights crew coxed by Sohen Biln. Loomer was originally a member of the eights crew that would go on to win silver at the 1960 Summer Olympics, but was sent to assist Keith Donald in the coxless pairs instead, which led to alternate David Anderson taking his place. Donald and Loomer were eliminated in the opening round of the event and failed to qualify for the semifinals during the repêchage. Loomer retired from active competition after the Games and went to the University of Victoria in 1963, where he founded and coached their rowing program. Holding degrees in pharmacy and international relations from UBC, he also had a career as a pharmacist that began in 1967, while an interest in painting led him to work as a teacher of watercolour painting at the Pearson College of the Pacific at the Summer School of Arts.

From 1924-28, she studied piano and theory in Vancouver, where she later taught for 26 years. Subsequently, she attended the Royal College of Music in London on a scholarship. Back in Vancouver, she gave private lessons for some years and married in 1935. During this period, she wrote music especially for voice and piano. She continued her studies in composition and started to compose for orchestra. Her Symphony No. 1 dated from 1951. In 1955-56 she lived in France and started to compose an opera (The Return of the Native, completed in 1979 and first performed in September, 1993), and a violin concerto. In 1978 the well-known West Coast musician was made an Officer of the Order of Canada and in 1984 named Composer of the Year. Many of Coulthard Adams’ more than 350 works are romantic and impressionistic, comprising every genre. In her later years she wrote especially complex compositions, some of them commissioned and performed by the Vancouver Symphony Orchestra. She completed her last work just months before she died aged 92. Her papers are deposited at the Archives of the University of British Columbia. Jean Coulhard’s daughter, Jane Adams, became a painter and graphic artist. Both worked together in creating the eight volumes of Music of Our Time. Coulthard Adams’ entry in the 1948 Olympic art competitions (category instrumental and chamber music) was her Sonata for Oboe and Piano. The 11-minute long sonata was composed in 1947 and revised in 1972. The movements are I. Gently Flowing; II. Sicilienne. Quite Slowly; III. Allegro. It was released on CD (“Canadian Works for Oboe & Piano”) in 2017 by the Canadian Music Centre. In the 1952 exhibition, she presented Night Wind, a “cycle of four songs after poems by Douglas Le Pan” (1914-98), titled after the title of the last song. The titles of the other three songs are No Music is Abroad, October and Canterbury. They are taken from Le Pan’s collection of poems The Wounded Prince and Other Poems, published in 1948. Jean Coulthard-Adams composed the songs in 1951 for soprano (or middle range) and piano or orchestra. The total duration is about 12-minutes. The orchestration is by cellist W. M. Miles, with whom the composer collaborated on several occasions.",

His first notable success came in 2000 when he steered the Oxford University women’s eight to victory over their Cambridge counterparts in the women’s University Boat Race. After he returned to Oxford in 2001 to study for a doctorate he began to cox the men’s eight and in 2005 added a victory in the men’s race to his earlier victory. Later that year he began working with the British national team as coxswain to the men’s eight. He guided the crew to a bronze medal at the 2007 World Rowing Championships in Munich before going one position better at the Beijing Olympics when his crew narrowly edged out the USA for the silver medal spot. Nethercott intended to return to the national team in 2010 after taking a year out from competition but he was diagnosed with an aggressive form of brain cancer.

25458,Reinhold Münzenberg,Male,25 January 1909,175.0,77, Germany,GER,"Reinhold Münzenberg, nicknamed “Der Eiserne” (made of iron), was an institution in Aachen’s football scene. He started playing at the age of 10. Throughout his life he competed for the local football club Alemannia, even after World War II in the Western Division of the “Oberliga” (Upper League). He played for other clubs for only short periods, such as the FK Pirmasens in 1933 and, towards the end of the war, for the Air Force Club in Hamburg, VfL Neckarau and Werder Bremen. Münzenberg was the typical center-half, who had to stop the center forward. He and Paul Janes became regular defenders on the national team when Herberger took over as national coach after the Olympics in Berlin. He was an excellent header and had a very hard kick. His first international match was in 1930 against Denmark. The second international match could well have been his last, when he shot an own goal in the first match against France in Paris. For the next few years he played sporadically for the national team, until he was called for the third-place match of the 1934 World Cup and had to postpone his wedding. With Münzenberg, Germany defeated Austria. For some years he competed regularly for Germany, until he got fierce competition from other players, notably from Austria after the annexation. He was part of the squad for the 1938 World Cup, but did not get a chance to play. His final international appearance was a defeat against England in May 1938 in Berlin. Münzenberg was a member of the famous “Breslau 11” and appeared in 41 international matches between 1930 and 1939, including 8 as captain. After the war Münzenberg ran a contracting business. From 1974-76 he was president of his native club Alemannia Aachen. In 1986 he suffered a heart attack, just a few hours after he had been watching Germany’s dramatic World Cup semi-final against France on television.",

She came east from California while still a pigtailed teenager to win her first major title in 1922. She would eventually win eight Wimbledon, seven U.S. and French singles titles, with her last being the Wimbledon championship in 1938. This impressive total of victories was accomplished despite the fact that she did not play in the U.S. championships after 1933 because of an estrangement with the authorities. Helen Wills won the Olympic singles in 1924 without the loss of a set and added a second gold medal by taking the doubles with her coach, Hazel Wightman, who was almost 20 years her senior. In 1959 she was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame. Helen Wills was educated at the University of California (Berkeley). She also wrote poems and illustrated books. She painted throughout her life and met several well-known artists. In the 1932 Olympic Arts Competition Wills submitted a total of 12 studies of fellow tennis players, including three self-portraits.

Jackson had an eight-year career in the NBA, all with Philadelphia. In his first year in the league he made the NBA All-Rookie team and later played in two NBA All-Star games. Jackson was never mentioned as the greatest forward in the league, but he had a job to do and did it to perfection. He was an outstanding defensive player and strong rebounder who was never asked to score a lot of points. The culmination of his role as a team player came in 1966-67 when the Philadelphia team on which he played won 68 games and lost only 13. Jackson was an indispensable cog in this machine which some people think was the greatest NBA team ever to that time. After his playing career ended, Jackson spent 25 years as parks and recreation director of Beaumont, Texas before retiring.",Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the Summer Pan American Games (1–0–0 1963 São Paulo BAS gold)

69292,Alastair McCorquodale,Male,5 December 1925,183.0,78, Great Britain,GBR,"The 1948 London Olympics took a retrograde step by failing to use electronic timing, similar to that used at the 1932 and 1936 Games. However, the 1948 sprint final was unique in that photo-finish equipment (albeit more akin to separating race horses rather than sprint athletes) was used for the first time and, while the times for the first four athletes came under much discussion, the photo-finish clearly showed McCorquodale just missing out on a medal in fourth place. However, his performance in finishing behind Harrison Dillard, Barney Ewell and Lloyd LaBeach, earned him the title: “The fastest white man in the world.” McCorquodale did, however, win a silver medal as part of the British sprint relay team, but only after they initially thought they had won the gold medal after the USA team was disqualified. Two days later, however, it was ruled there was no baton-change infringement by the Americans, and they were re-instated. In 2006 the Swiss watchmakers Omega were granted a multi-million dollar contract to become the official timekeeper for the 2010 Winter and 2012 Summer Olympics. Ironically for McCorquodale, it was Omega who timed that first Olympic sprint photo-finish in 1948. Educated at Harrow School, McCorquodale played in the cricket and football first XIs, and played in the annual Eton-Harrow cricket match at Lord’s in the rain affected match of 1943, and again in 1944. He also played for the Public Schools XI. A fine all-round sportsman, he was also a keen rugby player, and twice won the all-round Victor Ludorum title in the sprint events at Harrow. McCorquodale joined the Coldstream Guards in 1945, and served briefly as a lieutenant in Germany. He started running seriously when stationed in Lincolnshire in 1947, when the promise of a weekend pass if he went running for the Army appealed to him. He won the Army 100-yards Championship in 1947 in a time of 9.9s, and was fifth in the AAA 100 that year. Because of the war, McCorquodale missed the chance to go to university. He left the Army at the beginning of 1948 and joined the London Athletic Club, where he was coached by a former fellow Harrovian Guy Butler. McCorquodale won the 1948 AAA 220 yards, and finished second in the 100, behind Australian John Treloar. McCorquodale’s athletics career was all-too-brief, and his final race was in the sprint relay for the British Empire against the United States at the White City shortly after the London Olympics. He quit the sport to concentrate on his first love, cricket, and work in the family printing business, McCorqudale’s, who, ironically, printed the programme for the 1948 Olympics. He played three First Class cricket matches for Middlesex, and also regularly for their Second XI. He also played for the MCC, and toured Canada with them in 1951. His cricketing career would have been longer, and probably more successful, had he not dedicated so much of his time to the family business, of which he was chairman from 1967 until his retirement in January 1986. McCorquodale was the Nephew of First Class cricketer Guy Edwards. He was also related to authoress Barbara Cartland, as was Lady Diana Spencer, whose sister, Lady Sarah, married McCorquodale’s son Neil in 1980.

Weber played in the National Amateur almost every year, and in 1923 he qualified for the match play, again losing in the first round. In the interim, however, he fared better, making it to the 1905 semi-finals and the 1910 quarter-finals. In 1914 he made his only appearance at the British Amateur, reaching the fourth round.

He was appointed curate at St.Saviour’s, Hoxton until 1908 when he became a Bethnal Green vicar, rector and in 1916, a rural dean. At university, Sarel narrowly failed to win a blue as a half-miler and after entering the Church, took up walking and cross-country running. Although placing sixth in the 7 mile walk at the 1908 AAA Championships, he was elected for the shorter of the two walking events at the Olympics and was eliminated in the heats of the 3,500 walk. He became a legendary figure for his missionary work on London’s East End and his obituary in The Times reported, “For many years, he made a practice of changing into running kit at 11 PM sharp and running round the streets of Bethnal Green with a stop-watch in his hand. He was a beloved figure throughout the Borough, to the interests of whose people he devoted his life.” He served as President of London AC in 1928.",Listed in Olympic Clerics (Parish priest of the Church of England and Rural Dean of Bethnal Green)

He was also a member of the initial selection for the 1924 race but did not get a seat. Heap rowed at the Henley Regatta with the Jesus eight in 1922, and in 1923 and 1924 was beaten in the final of the Ladies’ Challenge Plate by Trinity College, Oxford, and Shrewsbury School respectively. He was also a member of the Jesus eight that lost to Leander in the final of the Grand in 1924, and also that year was a reserve for the Great Britain eight at the Paris Olympics. After graduating from Cambridge, Heap, whose mother was American, went to live and work in the family business in the United States, where he married his first wife in 1932. Following a divorce Heap returned to Britain to join the Army in World War II. After the war he bought a dairy farm in South Africa’s Western Cape and married his second wife, the journalist and writer Peggy Spooner in 1954. Although he had given up rowing, Heap still maintained his love of the water as a keen yachtsman. At the time of his death in 2000, Heap was believed to be the oldest living University Blue.",

His adoptive parents taught him to play tennis, although he also enjoyed cricket and rugby. After a spell at London University, he was went up to Christ Church College at Oxford. In 1894, John Boland invited a Greek acquaintance, Konstantinos Manos, to speak at the Oxford Union. His guest chose as his subject the revival of the Modern Olympic Games. Boland and Manos subsequently became close friends and Boland was invited to spend the Easter holidays of 1896 in Athens. Although John Boland had no intention of competing in the Olympic Games, his host, who was a member of the Organizing Committee, prevailed upon the 26-year-old Irishman to enter the lawn tennis tournament. Boland had little experience of domestic tournament play and none whatsoever of the international competition but, surprisingly, he succeeded in wining two Olympic gold medals. Boland took the singles title by beating Dimitrios Kasdaglis of Egypt in three sets and then joined with Fritz Traun of Germany, whose original partner had withdrawn because of injury, for a comfortable victory in the men’s doubles. John Boland benefited from a broad educational background. He attended the Catholic University School in Dublin and Edgbaston Oratory, and then studied at the Universities of Oxford, London and Bonn, a final academic grounding which put him in good stead later in life. Boland was Called to the Bar in 1897 and was the Member of Parliament for South Kerry from 1900 to 1918. He was General Secretary of the Catholic Truth Society for 21 years and a member of the Commission for the foundation of the National University of Ireland. Up until his death, which appropriately occurred on St. Patrick’s Day, he was a keen advocate of the Irish language being an essential subject in the matriculation examination of the National University which he had helped establish to some 50 years earlier. Two of Boland’s five daughters also achieved recognition in their chosen fields. As Mrs. Crowley, Honor Boland became a national political figure as the Dáil Éireann representative for East Kerry from 1945-66, and Bridget Boland was a notable playwright who will be remembered for her highly-acclaimed work, “The Prisoner”. As his biographer Cyril White wrote, Boland himself “passed away, most appropriately for an Irishman, on St. Patrick’s Day, 1958”.",Listed in Olympians Who Were Members of National Legislatures (Member of the UK House of Commons 1900-1918 (Irish Parliamentary Party))

14191,Tony Doyle,Male,19 May 1958,185.0,79, Great Britain,GBR,"Tony Doyle was unquestionably the great British track cyclist in the 1980s, when he was also outstanding on the world stage. Doyle took up track racing at the age of 14 and in 1977 won his first national title (individual pursuit). He also won the Madison title with Glen Mitchell that year. The following year Doyle retained his pursuit title and won a bronze medal in both the individual and team pursuit events at the Edmonton Commonwealth Games. A third consecutive national pursuit title followed in 1979 when he also regained the Madison with Mitchell, and added the 50 km points race, to make it six national titles in three years. Doyle went to the 1980 Moskva Olympics but was not selected for the individual pursuit. The selectors were undecided whether Doyle or Sean Yates should race the individual. Despite Doyle beating Yates in a race-off, the selectors still chose Yates. Doyle was, however, on the British team that set a world record in Moskva as the first pursuit quartet under 4:20. The track was so fast that their time was bettered by other teams and they could only finish seventh. Immediately after the 1980 Olympics, Doyle turned professional with the KP Crisps-Viscount team and within six weeks had repaid his sponsors by winning both the National and World Pursuit Championships. After retaining his national title in 1981, Doyle turned to six-day racing and in 1983, with Danny Clark, became the first Briton to win a six-day race, at Berlin. Doyle’s other six-day partner was Gary Wiggins, father of five-times Olympic champion Bradley. Doyle won a total of 23 six-day races, 19 of them with Danny Clark, which made them the third most successful six-day combination after Bruno Risi and Kurt Betschart (Switzerland) and Gustav Killian and Heinz Vopel (Germany). Doyle won the pursuit silver medal behind Hans-Henrik Ørsted of Denmark at both the 1984 and 1985 World Championships but turned the tables on the Dane in 1986 to win his second world title. Doyle then added a bronze in 1987 and silver in 1988. In addition to his two world titles, Doyle won four European titles. He won the Madison with Gary Wiggins in 1984 and with Danny Clark in 1988 and 1989. Doyle was also the Omnium champion in 1989. That year he was awarded the MBE for his services to cycling, but later in the year he was involved in a serious crash during the München Six-Day race when the Russian rider, Marat Ganeyev, cut across Doyle and took him down at more than 35 mph (56 kph). Doyle suffered brain trauma, developed a lung infection, and a fractured shoulder blade and broken elbow. To make matters worse, he was dropped off the stretcher by officials while being removed from the scene of the accident. Doyle was in a coma for 10 days and given the last rites when he got to hospital. It was six months before he returned to competitive racing and in 1994 he won a silver medal in the team pursuit at the Victoria (BC) Commonwealth Games. Injury caused Doyle to finally retire in 1995 when he became president of British Cycling (then the British Cycling Federation) and was race director of the Tour of Britain. Doyle was also a good road racer and finished second overall in the 1984 Sealink International stage race, just one second behind winner Malcolm Elliott.

45212,Harold Hardwick,Male,14 December 1888,,, Australasia,ANZ,"Harold Hardwick began swimming at an early age and, at age 16 while attending Fort Street High School, he became the Sydney Public Schools’ swimming champion. He also played rugby in the school’s first XV and captained its lifesaving team. A regular at Frederick Cavill’s baths, Hardwick mastered the new “Australian crawl” stroke invented by Dick Cavill and learned the Trudgeon stroke for long distances. Hardwick won New South Wales championships in the 100 yds freestyle in 1908-09, and 220 yds, 300 yds, 440 yds, and mile freestyle in 1909. In 1911 Hardwick won the 220 yds, 440 yds and 880 yds freestyle at the Australasian Championships and was sent to represent Australasia at the Festival of Empire in London, a precursor to the Commonwealth Games to commemorate the coronation of George V. At London, Hardwick competed in both swimming and boxing, something he had first trained in at age 10, winning the Empire 100 yds title and two days later the Empire heavyweight title. He also won the 100 yds, 220 yds and 440 yds freestyles at the 1911 British Amateur Swimming Association championships and on his return home was named Australian Sportsman of the Year. Hardwick competed at the 1912 Olympics, where he was a member of the Australasian team that won the 4x200 m freestyle relay gold with world records of 10:14.0, set in round one, and 10:11.2 in the final. Hardwick also won bronze medals in the 400 m and 1,500 m freestyles. After returning from the Olympics, Hardwick stopped swimming internationally, concentrating on boxing and rugby. In 1910, Hardwick had been selected for New South Wales to play rugby against a visiting American universities team and representing Eastern Suburbs RUFC, Hardwick won the Sydney premierships (later named Shute Shield) in 1913. In 1914 Hardwick won the New South Wales amateur heavyweight boxing championship and in 1915 he turned professional, signing to appear for the promoter Snowy Baker. The same year, Hardwick won the Australian heavyweight title, but lost it to Les Darcy in February 1916. Hardwick’s career was interrupted by World War I and he finished his boxing career with a record of 4 wins (1 KO) and 5 losses (3 KOs). Hardwick was also a founding member of Manly Surf Club and won the New South Wales surf lifesaving championships with them in 1914. Hardwick enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force in August 1917 and served with the No. 2 Signal Squadron as a sapper in the Middle East. In April 1919 at the Inter-Theatre of War Boxing Tournament at Aldershot, England, Hardwick won the heavyweight boxing title and chosen by his fellow competitors, he was awarded a cup as the “Ideal Sportsman” of the British forces. At the Inter-Allied Games held in Paris in 1919 Hardwick was a member of the victorious Australian 4x200 free relay team. On his return home, Hardwick’s application for reinstatement as an amateur was rejected by the New South Wales Amateur Swimming Association and he retired from sports. In 1920 Hardwick joined the Department of Education as supervisor of swimming and was responsible for organizing holiday swimming schools throughout the New South Wales. In 1938 he directed the schoolchildren’s display at Australia’s 150th Anniversary Celebrations. He retired as deputy-director of physical education in February 1953. In 1921 Hardwick had been commissioned in the Militia and as a temporary lieutenant-colonel he commanded the 1st Cavalry Divisional Signals from 1940 until his transfer to the Reserve of Officers in April 1942 as a colonel. Hardwick was inducted into the Sport Australia Hall of Fame in 1985 and since 1959 the Harold Hardwick Memorial Trophy has been awarded annually to the winner of the New South Wales 100 m freestyle schoolboy title.","Listed in Olympians Who Set a World Record in Long Course Swimming (4×200 m freestyle relay – 12 July 1912 - 29 August 1920: 10:14.0 (12 July 1912; Stockholm, SWE), 10:11.6 (15 July 1912; Stockholm, SWE)) Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the British Empire/Commonwealth Games (2–0–0 1911 London BOX gold: heavyweight, SWI gold: 100 yards freestyle)"

The limit for entrants per nation in all individual shooting events was 12. But the entry forms for George Barnes, the eventual bronze medalist, were lost, and Plater was named as the 12th British entrant in his place. However, an extension of the deadline for entries was made and Barnes’s application was eventually accepted. On the day of the competition, the British team officials lost count of the number of British shooters who had competed in this event. With only half an hour to go before the time limit, they called on Plater to shoot, thinking he was the 12th British shooter in the small-bore rifle when, in fact, he was the 13th - one beyond the limit. In varying light, a gusty wind, and fine drizzle, he fired his 80 rounds in less than 30 minutes, scoring 391, the leading score and a new world record. In the initial results issued by the National Rifle Association, and published in The Sporting Life, Plater was listed as the winner. But the error of Britain having 13 competitors was then discovered and it took several days to sort out the error. It was not certain if Plater’s or Barnes’ mark would be deleted from the official results, but eventually Plater was declared an unofficial entrant and not given an Olympic medal. But in October 1908, Philip Plater was presented a special gold medal and a record diploma by the British Olympic Council.",

At the start of World War I in 1914, Powell was an infantry officer but in 1916 switched to the Royal Flying Corps (later the Royal Air Force) where he was an aeroplane observer with the Intelligence Department. He went on to become a squadron leader, and later a wing-commander. He returned to Eton in 1919, but then took a year out to study art in Paris with a view to becoming the school’s art master, a post he duly obtained. A keen artist in his own right, Powell painted mostly with watercolours. He was a member of the Reading Guild of Artists and exhibited at the Walker’s Galleries in New Bond Street, London. Powell’s other passion was mountaineering. He took it up just after the end of the War, but by 1925 had climbed many of the leading Alpine peaks. A member of the Alpine Club, Powell was one of four Eton masters who went to the Swiss Alps in 1933 with a view to reaching the peak of Piz Roseg, near Pontresina on the Italian border. Sadly, while making the descent, all four fell to their death and are buried in a joint grave at Pontresina. A few months after his death, the Walker’s Galleries held a memorial exhibition of some 90 of Powell’s works including, ironically, three pictures of the Piz Roseg peak where he lost his life.","Brother-in-law of Harold Barker Listed in Olympians Who Died in Mountaineering Accidents (Died in alpine accident.)

922131,Athole Still,Male,1933,,, Great Britain,GBR,"Athole Still went to the 1952 Helsinki Olympics as a teenager but was only a reserve for the Great Britain 4x200 metres relay squad. His best performances, however, came after those Games. At Dundee in 1954, Still set a British Native 110 yards freestyle record of 58.5, and the following year finished second to both Ronald Roberts and Neil McKechnie respectively in the 110 and 220 yards freestyle finals at the ASA Championships in Blackpool. It was the nearest Still came to winning an ASA title. Still served with the Royal Air Force (RAF) for two years from 1955 while doing his National Service. His finest moment in the pool came after demobilisation, when he won the 4x220 freestyle relay with the Scotland foursome at the 1958 Cardiff British Empire and Commonwealth Games. This made up for his disappointment at missing out on a place in the relay squad at the 1952 Olympics. Still had been an inspiration to the great Scottish champion Ian Black, who was a fellow member of the Gordonians Swimming Club. When Black retired, the day before his 21st birthday in 1962, Still also decided to quit competitive swimming, to embark on a successful career in journalism. Still became swimming and opera correspondent for The Times and also commentated for ITV, until they pulled out of swimming coverage in the late 1980s. During his journalism days, Still dovetailed his job with that of opera singing, for which he had a passion since he was a youngster. He had studied languages at Robert Gordon’s College, Aberdeen, and got his professional operatic break in 1966 when he performed at His Majesty’s Theatre, Aberdeen when he was brought in as an understudy for the opera Boris Godunov. Still went on to become the principal operatic tenor with the Scottish Opera. He enjoyed a tour of Britain with La bohème, had a summer season at Glyndebourne, and then toured with Macbeth. When his voice was eventually not good enough to perform at the highest level, he established Athole Still International in the late 1980s. It was an agency for opera singers and sportspeople. Representing opera singers provided the bulk of Still’s business, but he was also involved in some high-profile sporting deals and transactions over the years. His biggest football deals involved taking John Barnes from Watford to Liverpool, Gianluca Vialla from Juventus to Chelsea and Sven-Goran Eriksson into the England manager’s job. Still acted as the agent for Olympians Duncan Goodhew, Steven Redgrave, James Cracknell, and Sharron Davies and many other high-profile sportspeople, including jockeys Willie Carson and Tony McCoy.",Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the British Empire/Commonwealth Games (0–1–0 1958 Cardiff SWI silver: 4×220 yards freestyle (competed for Scotland))

920938,Yoshioki Hasegawa,Male,3 March 1892,,, Japan,JPN,"Japanese sculptor Yoshioki Hasegawa was born as Katsuyuki Hasegawa and also used the stage name Taikai. He graduated from the sculpture department of the Tokyo School of Fine Arts in 1915. At the 1920 Emperor Exhibition his sculpture Reikō (Divine Light) won him the first of numerous prizes at official exhibitions. In 1924, he created the monument for Admiral Prince Higashifushimi Yorihito, and in a competition in 1936 he was awarded the first prize for his Meian (Light and Dark), a relief of the empire education tower, which was located in a park in Osaka. One of Yoshioki’s favorite subjects was the Japanese national sport Sumo. He submitted Enban’nage (Discus Throw) to the 1932 Olympic Arts Competition in Los Angeles and four years later four works to the art competition in Berlin, of which Ryoka Mae (Rikishi) (Two Figures (Wrestling)) achieved an Honorable Mention. The fact that he portrayed both historical Japanese and western sports is a sign of the cultural transition period in Japan. Hasegawa was active in various art societies, notably for the Japanese Sculpture Association, the Japanese Society for Engraved Pottery and others. He received the Gongju Medal just weeks before he died at his home in Tokyo from pneumonia. A 25 cm high bronze figure of the golf icon Bobby Jones from 1935 is the only one by Hasegawa, although it shows a putt and not a drive. However, it is probably not the work presented in Berlin. An illustration from the Japanese section of the exhibition in Berlin shows in the center the approximately life-sized sculpture Wrestling, Technique of a Wrestling Champion. The sculpture National Sport, the addition “Wrestling” seems to be a clarification for the catalog, was probably made as a model in 1936, but as a bronze not before 1938. It stands in front of the Sumo Hall in the park of the old Takaoka Castle, his hometown. A cast from 1977 was placed in front of the Sumo hall of the Yasukuni Shrine in Tokyo’s Chiyoda district. The two most important Sumo wrestlers of the early 20th century, Hitachiyama and Umegatani, are shown. The work Sumo (Wrestling) - Ready! National sport, as it is titled in the catalog, is listed in Japanese sources under arts and crafts is entitled Shikiri, in Sumo the preparation phase before the fight. The bronze Discus throw from 1932 could not be identified.",

He belonged to the so-called Mediterraneanism school and is considered the most important Catalan sculptor of the first half of the 20th century. This style is characterized by figurative, compact and solid sculptures in the 20th Century. First with Isadora Duncan, and later with Antonia Merce, after Duncan had died, he had two very famous dancers as muses. Further study on journeys to London and Italy completed his style. His brother Juan Clará Ayats (1875-1958) was also a sculptor. In 1924, José was also a member of the jury for sculpturing.

890541,Alfred Downer,Male,23 January 1873,,, Great Britain,GBR,"Alfred Downer was a 4th generation Jamaican whose family had arrived on the island in the early 19th century and is sometimes described as the first of the line of great sprinters that Jamaica has produced. When his parents’ marriage collapsed around 1880 he went to live in the UK with his mother. There he was educated at George Watson’s College in Edinburgh and latterly at the Edinburgh Institute where he began to excel as an athlete. Downer began to make an impact as a sprinter at the age of 20 in 1893 when he won Scottish titles at 100y, 220y and 440y – a feat he was to repeat for the next two years. Over this period he was regularly in the top ten of the world lists and recorded the fastest times for both the 100 metres and 100 yards in 1895. Downer would have been one of the favourites to take the 100 m title at the revival of the Olympics in 1896 but was not present at Athina and was declared a professional before the end of the year. During his first years as a pro he developed a rivalry with Edgar Bredin which might have come to a climax at the professional events at the 1900 Olympics had it not been for Downer suffering an Achilles injury in the high hurdles in Paris. Downer never returned to his former form and his performances followed a slow decline. Some modern research has suggested that a bout of malaria affected his general health or that he struggled with alcohol abuse whilst there is also documentary evidence that syphilis may have accounted for his early death at the age of 39 in 1912. In 1899 his autobiography, Running Recollections and How to Train was published.",

Living and working as a postman in the famous Gorbals district of Glasgow, he joined the Bellahouston Harriers and won their 1900 cross-country title. At one time he held every Scottish record from 1000y to 4 miles. He won a total of 12 Scottish AAA titles: 880y (1903-04, 1907); mile (1902-07, 1910), and 4 miles (1902-03). At Ibrox Stadium on 20 June 1903 McGough won the half-mile, mile and 4-miles titles all in the same afternoon. He was also the Irish AAA champion at both 2 and 3 miles in 1905 and at one mile in 1907. He also finished as runner-up at three successive AAA Championships (1904-06). This was undoubtedly his best distance and he won a silver medal in the 1500 at the 1906 Olympic Games. His journey to Athens for the Games was not a pleasant one as he suffered sea-sickness during part of the trip. He also suffered at the 1908 London Olympics when ran in the 1500 metres with a bandaged ankle and missed the final after finishing third in his heat. Between 1901-11 McGough averaged more than 20 wins per year and it is said that no Scottish runner won more handicap races off scratch than he did. In his younger days McGough helped out Glasgow Celtic FC as a masseur in the winter months and after his retirement from athletics in 1910 was appointed the assistant manager to Bob Davies at Celtic. When Davies took over at Manchester City FC, McGough moved with him, and stayed until the outbreak of the war when he returned to his native Ireland and became a farmer.

18154,Charles Cory,Male,31 January 1857,,, United States,USA,"Charles Cory’s sole contribution to Olympic history was to shoot a 94 in the first qualifying round of the 1904 golf tournament; he did not start the second round. Cory played in the 1903 US Amateur tournament, winning one match and going out in the second round. Born into a wealthy Bostonian family, Cory briefly attended both Harvard and Boston Law School but left both to continue travelling around the world. From a young age he had developed an interest in natural history which eventually led him to become one of America’s leading ornithologists. A founder member of the American Ornithologists’ Union, he set up one of the USA’s first bird sanctuaries on his thousand acre estate at Hyanis, Massachusetts. Cory published over a hundred books on the subject of birds and had seven species named after him including the sea birds, Cory’s Least Bittern and Cory’s Shearwater. The Latin name of the Florida Cougar (Felis coryi) is also a tribute to him. His sporting career was not limited to golf; he was reputed to have been an excellent baseball pitcher in his younger days and was one of the finest pistol shooters in the whole of America. During his brief spell in college he took up billiards and won the state championships of Massachusetts, albeit under an assumed name to avoid the “attendant notoriety”. Cory took up golf in 1897 and within a few years had become one of the USA’s foremost amateur players. He won the North and South Amateur Championship in Pinehurst, North Carolina in 1902 and was runner-up in the same tournament two years later. He donated his collection of 19,000 bird specimens to the Chicago Field Museum and was given an honorary title of Curator of Ornithology. However when his vast fortune was lost after a disastrous investment in 1906, he took a salaried position at the museum as Curator of Zoology. His son, Charles, later became a top hurdler, winning the 1913 AAU title in the 200 low hurdles.",

She also made her Wightman Cup début in the first winning Great Britain team in 1924. She was also on the winning team the following year but in 1926 Colyer and Kitty McKane lost the deciding doubles, after winning the first set, to hand the Americans a 4-3 victory. With McKane she was runner-up in the French championship in 1925 and a year later was the beaten finalist at both the French and Wimbledon championships. She enjoyed a rare moment of singles success in 1926 when she won the Queen’s Club covered court title. Evelyn Colyer met Indian tea planter Hamish Munro on a skiing trip in Switzerland and five weeks later, in February 1930, they married and moved to India. On 27 October 1930 she gave birth to twins, a boy and girl, but a week later Evelyn sadly died, as did the twins. She had retired from tennis after her marriage and had previously turned down offers to turn professional and also declined the offer of a stage career.",

The United States did not compete at the 1980 Olympics and many athletes’ careers were shattered, but perhaps none more so than Kurt Thomas. Thomas had competed at the 1976 Olympics, and had won a bronze medal in all-around at the 1975 Pan American Games. In the years between 1976-80 he became the greatest American male gymnast to that date, winning a gold medal in floor exercise at the 1978 World Championships. In 1979 he won six medals at the Worlds, including golds on high bar and floor, and silvers in all-around, parallel bars, and pommeled horse. He also won the American Cup in 1978-79, was US all-around champion in 1977-78, and NCAA Champion in 1979 in all-around. Although the 1980 Olympics were in Moskva, and it would have been difficult to defeat the Soviet gymnasts on home soil, notably Aleksandr Dityatin, Thomas was considered a medal favorite in all-around and had a shot at the gold. After the 1980 Olympics, Thomas tried to continue competing but injuries eventually ended his career. He made a brief attempt at a comeback in 1992 but was unable to overcome his age and the health issues. He went into various ventures, including sports broadcasting of gymnastics events, performed in professional gymnastics shows, and starred in the 1985 movie “Gymkata.” Thomas and his wife later started the Kurt Thomas Gymnastics Training Center in Frisco, Texas. Thomas won the 1979 Nissen Award, given to the nation’s top collegiate gymnast, and the 1979 Sullivan Award, given to the nation’s premier amateur athlete. He is a member of the US Gymnastics Hall of Fame (1990), the Indiana State University Athletic Hall of Fame (1999), and in 2003 was inducted into the International Gymnastics Hall of Fame. In gymnastics he is perhaps best remember for the Thomas Flair, a pommeled horse move that he developed and perfected.","Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the Summer Pan American Games (1–2–2 1975 Ciudad de México GYM gold: team, silver: pommelled horse and horse vault, bronze: all-around and horizontal bar) Listed in Olympians Who Acted in Movies (Gymkata) Listed in Olympians Who Were Awarded the James E.

13598,José Beyaert,Male,1 October 1925,,, France,FRA,"During World War II, José Beyaert served in the French resistance, presaging a later life behind the lines. Prior to the 1948 Olympics, Beyaert had minimal credentials as a cyclist outside of France, winning the minor Paris-Briare race in 1947, placing third in the 1947 Paris-London stage race, and finishing 11th that year at the World Amateur Championships. After the 1948 Olympics, he turned professional and had a few minor wins in 1950 - the Grand Prix d’Isbergues and Paris-Boulogne sur Mer. He rode in both the 1950 and 1951 Tour de France, placing 47th in 1950 and abandoning in 1951, and rode several of the one-day classics in those years as well. Beyaert then settled in Colombia where he won the 1952 Tour of Colombia, but he rode for only a few more years. He spent most of his life in Colombia, returning to France to live only in 2000. His activities in Colombia are poorly documented, but a biography Olympic Gangster, by Matt Rendell, tells much of what is known. While there he worked at various times as a cycling coach, an emerald trader, a logger in Brazíl, where he had a lover and several children, and as a businessman, as he and his wife, Louisette, ran a café in Bogota. There are many holes in the story that cannot be fully filled, but Beyaert probably worked as a drug smuggler, trafficking in cocaine and heroin. He made many trips throughout South and Central America, and back to France, and his associates were known to be in this trade, notably several of those whose story was later told in the book and movie, “The French Connection,” about the French drug trade. The book also details suspicions about possible murders Beyaert committed during his work, but so much of his life was mired in mystery, that it is difficult to be certain of this. Later in life, Beyaert helped train and coach some of the first Colombian teams that rode in the Tour de France, and served as a cycling commentator for Colombian television and radio.",

He was a frequent visitor of the sporting events at that stadium and, inspired by the performances of Vsevolod Bobrov, decided to take up hockey. Soon his talent was noticed by the Soviet hockey officials and in 1958 he was called to join CSKA Moskva, where he played his entire career. With CSKA Moskva, Almetov won seven Soviet Championships titles (1959-61, 1963-66) and was the best goalscorer in the 1964 Soviet Championships with 40 goals. Internationally Almetov played with Soviet national team from 1959 until 1967, being capped 107 times, scoring 75 goals. Playing together with his teammates from CSKA Moskva, Veniamin Aleksandrov and Konstantin Loktev, Almetov formed one of the best lines in the Soviet hockey history and they were primarily behind the Soviet success in the early 1960s, scoring more than 250 goals in about 100 matches. With the Soviet national team, Almetov won a gold and bronze at the Olympics, was World Champion five times (1963-67) and won two bronzes (1960-61) at the World Championships. He also won six European Championships titles (1960, 1963-67) and was a runner-up in 1961. In 1967 Almetov was expelled from CSKA Moskva, because of drinking problems, a lack of discipline and undermining the coaches’ authority, and after that, he decided to retire from hockey, at only 27-years-old. He then took up a coaching position with the CSKA Moskva junior team, but his drinking problems continued and he was soon fired from that position as well. So for the next 20 years Almetov worked as a grave-digger in the Vagankovsky Cemetery in Moscow. In 1990 Almetov and his wife emigrated to the United States, but returned to Russia shortly after that, and in less than a year after his return to homeland, Almetov died of pneumonia in Moscow.",Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the European Ice Hockey Championships (6–1–0 1960 Squaw Valley (Olympics) gold; 1961 Genève and Lausanne silver; 1963 Stockholm gold; 1964 Innsbruck (Olympics) gold; 1965 Tampere gold; 1966 Ljubljana gold; 1967 Wien gold) Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the World Ice Hockey Championships (5–0–2 1960 Squaw Valley (Olympics) bronze; 1961 Genève and Lausanne bronze; 1963 Stockholm gold; 1964 Innsbruck (Olympics) gold; 1965 Tampere gold; 1966 Ljubljana gold; 1967 Wien gold)

81251,Tonya Harding,Female,12 November 1970,155.0,48, United States,USA,"Tonya Harding was a singles skater who is probably the most controversial figure skater in American history. Unlike most figure skaters, Harding was from a poor family, decidedly from the wrong side of the figure skating tracks. She hunted and fished, was an accomplished auto mechanic, played pool, smoked cigarettes, and was completely outside the skating establishment. But she started skating at a local rink, and her athletic ability made her a great jumper, one of the best in women’s skating history. In 1987, Harding had her first major podium with second at Skate America. At that competition, her jumping ability came to the fore, as she was the first woman to perform a triple axel in the short program, the first woman to do two triple axels in a program, and the first female to perform a triple axel combination (with a double toe loop). In 1989 she was third at the US Championships, but her big breakthrough year was 1990 when she won Skate America and the Nations Cup. In 1991 she won the US title and was second at the World Championships and the NHK Trophy. Harding was fourth at the 1992 Winter Olympics and heading into the 1994 season, her big rival was Nancy Kerrigan, a much more polished, traditional skater, but one without Harding’s jumping ability. Beautiful, quiet, and classy, Kerrigan started to reap the rewards of the more traditional skating world, and received several commercial endorsements. Harding was getting none of this and she saw one way out. To get endorsements and money, she had to win the gold medal in Lillehammer and to her that meant eliminating Kerrigan as a competitor. At the time, Harding was then married to Jeff Gillooly. Gillooly contacted a friend, Shawn Eckardt, asking how a hit could be arranged on Kerrigan, disabling her for the Olympics. Eckardt eventually contacted Derrick Smith, who hired his nephew, Shane Stant, who agreed to attack Kerrigan and injure her leg. The group finally settled on attacking Kerrigan at the US Nationals in Detroit. Shortly before the competition, Kerrigan came off the ice after a training session, when a large man assaulted her with a solid-metal baton, hitting her just above the knee. The assailant was Stant, who escaped by running out of the arena to a getaway car. Kerrigan collapsed, crying out, “Why? Why me?” She could not skate at the Nationals. Two days later, Tonya Harding won the 1994 US Nationals and qualified for the Olympic team. The US had only two spots for the ladies’ event in Lillehammer. The second spot could go to Michelle Kwan, who finished second to Harding. But the US figure skating authorities held the spot open for Kerrigan, if she could show that she could recover in time for the Winter Olympics. Kwan graciously stepped aside and Kerrigan did recover in time to be named to the Winter Olympic team. Eventually Harding and her mob was caught, and she would be fined and sentenced to community service and she has had a difficult life since that episode. At Lillehammer, a media frenzy surrounded the women’s figure skating because of the “Kardigan Saga.” In Norway, Kerrigan skated beautifully, but lost out by the narrowest of margins to Ukrainian Oksana Bayul, earning a silver medal. Harding continued to be controversial in Lillehammer. In the free skate, she started but then noticed a problem with a skate. Approaching the judges in tears, she showed them her loose lace, requesting a re-skate, which she was granted. Harding finished eighth, but the lace incident was later famously re-created in a Seinfeld episode. After the 1994 fiasco, Harding’s life was difficult. Ostracized and banned by the figure skating establishment she could never skate professionally. To make money, she became a professional boxer, with a career record of three wins and three losses in 2003-04, and later was an announcer for TruTV.",Listed in Olympians Who Won a Medal at the World Figure Skating Championships (0–1–0 1991 München silver: singles)

A year later he placed fifth in that event, winning the 5,000 m. This earned him a spot on the Swedish team for the international championships. After winning the 10,000 m at the Europeans, he was considered an outsider for the long distance medals at the Squaw Valley Olympics, and only narrowly missed the podium in the 10k (4th). His greatest international success came in 1962. In front of a 250,000 person crowd (over two days), Nilsson took the bronze in the World Allround Championships in Moscow’s Lenin Stadium. A two-time Swedish champion (1961, 1963), Nilsson continued to compete in major international events through 1965, and bettered a number of Swedish records. His last major event was the 1969 Swedish championships, 10 years after his début. He skated together with Jonny Nilsson for much of his career, but they were not related.

17984,Herbert Wilson,Male,14 February 1875,,, Great Britain,GBR,"Captain Herbert Wilson was a figure of much influence in polo circles and maintained a fine home at Hurlingham, where he served as a member of the Hurlingham Committee, the governing body of polo. He often played at the neighboring club, Roehampton, and it was with their team that he won his Olympic gold medal in 1908. Of the winning Olympic team in 1908, only Wilson had not already played in the Westchester Cup although he was to do so in 1909 and 1911. Wilson also won the All-Ireland Open, the Army Cup, Ranelagh Open, Roehampton Cup, Public Schools’ Cup, and the Hurlingham Champion Cup, amongst others. He was also a keen huntsman and rode with the Quorn, the Cottesmore and Belvoir from his country residence at Ashby Folville in Leicestershire. Herbert Wilson was the son of Sir Samuel Wilson, an Irish-born landowner who moved to Australia in the mid-19th century with the purpose of mining for gold but turned to sheep grazing along with his brothers. Sir Samuel moved to England in 1881 and later became the MP for Portsmouth from 1886-92. He moved back to Australia in 1893, but two years later returned to England and died a few months thereafter. Wilson junior was educated at Eton and New College, Oxford. Soon after leaving Oxford he joined the Nottinghamshire Imperial Yeomanry, winning a DSO and Queen’s Medal in the Boer War. The fighting in South Africa, and later in France, took a cruel toll on the Wilson family. His brother Wilfred lost his life at the Boer War, whilst another brother Clarence was also severely wounded. In 1914-18 War, Herbert took a commission in the Royal Horse Guards and, along with his eldest brother, Lieutenant Colonel Gordon Wilson, MVO of the Royal Horse guards, was killed in action. Gordon was married to Lady Sarah Churchill, sister Sir Winston Churchill’s son Randolph. Hence only one of the four brothers survived the two wars, and he was gravely wounded.","Listed in Olympians Who Were Killed or Missing in Action or Died as a Result of War (†11 April 1917.

This was the first of her 10 national athletics titles: three in the 60 metres (1939, 1946, and 1949), four in the 100 metres (1941, 1942, 1945, and 1949), and three in the 200 metres (1941, 1942, and 1945). She was also runner-up in the 100 metres in 1943, 1947, and 1948, in the 200 metres in 1943, and the 80 metres hurdles in 1947 and 1948, and was the national triathlon champion in 1940. Her international career spanned a decade between 1939 and 1949, but World War II limited her most notable competition to the 1948 London Olympics. There, she was eliminated in round one of the 4x100 metres relay (alongside Rosine Faugouin, Liliane Sprécher, and Jeanine Moussier) and the semi-finals of the 80 metres hurdles.

He would skate with them continuously through 1920, with the exception of a stint in the military during World War I, when he served in the Royal Flying Corps as a pilot. After only six months of training, he and Falcon teammate Konnie Johannesson were such proficient flyers that they began training other new recruits. Upon his return to Canada, Fredrickson helped the Falcons capture the 1920 Allan Cup, given annually to the national senior men’s ice hockey champions, as well as a gold medal at that year’s Summer Olympic ice hockey tournament. During the journey to Antwerp, he and Johannesson teamed up with another passenger to form a musical trio that held concerts aboard the ship. Upon his return he suited up with the Victoria Aristocrats (later the Victoria Cougars) and began playing in the NHL when the Victoria Cougars became the Detroit Cougars (a precursor franchise to the Detroit Red Wings). He was quickly traded to the Boston Bruins where he stayed until late 1928 prior to being traded to the Pittsburgh Pirates. He was back in Detroit by 1930, with the team now being named the Falcons, but was quickly demoted down to the International Hockey League’s Detroit Olympics shortly before a knee injury ended his career in 1931. After his retirement from active competition Fredrickson served as a hockey coach on numerous levels, including the collegiate, with stints at Princeton University (1933-1935) and the University of British Columbia (1948-1950). He was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1958 and the Manitoba Hockey Hall of Fame in 1985, among numerous other honors.

The next day he surprised by placing third in the 10,000, only beaten by the famous stars Ivar Ballangrud and Charles Mathiesen. The Norwegian Skating Association then decided to enter this new long-distance man for the European Championships in Oslo three weeks later. Here Wangberg created a major sensation in the 5,000 m race, placing second just behind former world record holder Max Stiepl with a time of 8:21.8 and beating the recent world record holder and European champion Ballangrud with 7.1 seconds.

From 1924, he studied commercial art in Göteborg and worked in commercial illustration for the newspaper Göteborgs Posten before beginning his career at the glass manufacturers Orrefors in 1928. He undertook extensive study trips to Italy and France and was discovered internationally at the world exhibition in Stockholm in 1930. Lindstrand, artistic director until 1941, added new artistic dimensions to the already famous Orrefors glass with his unique designs and revitalization of classic forms and techniques. Working together with Simon Gate and Edward Hald he designed glass in classic forms with engraved decor and stylized figurative motifs, and then worked for various well-known ceramic and glass factories. In 1950 Lindstrand joined Kosta Glasbruk as an artistic director until his retirement in 1973, where he also developed new glass processing techniques. Among other things, he created the Icarus needle at the Technical University in Stuttgart in 1964. He then spent the last 10 years in his life as a freelance artist working at Studio Glashyttan in Åhus.

Having been first home when Derby & County AC won the Midlands junior cross-country title in 1907, Barnes helped them win the seniors title in 1910 and thus end the 17-year domination of Birchfield Harriers.

98260,Clas Thunberg,Male,5 April 1893,167.0,67, Finland,FIN,"Finland’s Clas Thunberg was one of the first internationally dominant speed skaters. His record of five Olympic gold medals in speed skating for men was equaled by Eric Heiden in 1980, who did it in one Olympics, but it has never been bettered. In 1924 he won the 1,500, 5,000 and the combined event, placed second in the 10K and third in the 500. Four years later, he won the 500 and defended his 1,500 crown. Further Olympic honors seemed certain at the 1932 Games but, like several leading European skaters, he refused to compete at Lake Placid as a protest against the mass-start style of racing. An unusual character, he was fiercely proud of his competitive record and was always slightly upset at not being accorded the same honors in Finland as his countryman, the legendary runner Paavo Nurmi. Thunberg made his World All-around Championship début in 1922 at the age of 28 and his final appearance was in 1935, aged 42. During this period he missed three Championships (1926, 1930, 1935) but still won 14 distance titles and was the overall champion five times (1923, 1925, 1928-29, 1931), winning silver in 1927 and bronze in 1922. He also won four titles (1922, 1928, 1931-32) and four silvers (1923-24, 1927, 1929) in all-around and 16 distance titles at the European All-around Championships. He set four officially ratified world records (and six not ratified), all of them in Davos: at 500 metres in 1929 and 1931, the 1000 metres in 1930 and the 3000 metres in 1932 when he was 38 years 278 days old and he remains the oldest man to set a world speed skating record. His 1,000 world record lasted exactly 25 years and one day, until it was bettered by the famous sprinter Yevgeny Grishin in 1955. He also won five Finnish all-around titles (1920, 1922, 1924, 1927-28). He later became a member of the Finnish Parliament (Eduskunta).

In 1908, he became a member of the Berlin Secession. After being deployed as a cartographer in World War I, he also taught at the Museum of Decorative Arts in the 1920s. One of his strengths was portraiture, especially portraits of his friends from the artistic community. Büttner’s painting Sportgelände des B.S.C. (Sports Grounds of the B.S.C.) is clearly documented by the illustration in the catalog. The Berlin Sports Club was founded in 1896 and at that time maintained a sports ground near the Avus racetrack. The pastel painting in the format 48 x 63 cm also appears under the titles Athletic Sports Field and Sports Field with Wooden Jumping Facility, Runners and Spectators. Tennis courts were among Büttner’s favorite motifs. Accordingly, the identification of his tennis-related works is difficult. Tennis Competition in Grunewald, aka Tennis at Rot/Weiß is a 20 x 28 cm etching from 1912. Most of the top German players played for the LTTC Rot-Weiß Berlin, which was founded as early as 1897. Whether the 1928 and 1932 entries under the title Tennis Competition at Heringsdorf are the same work is questionable. With regard to the used technique, there is divergent information in various sources.",

After a solid if unspectacular qualifying run in Nagano she produced a much better run in the final and then looked on as her more illustrious rivals failed to match her performance. By winning the moguls event in Nagano she became the first Japanese woman to become a Winter Olympic champion. The following month she won her 1st World Cup event and repeated this feat on home snow in Inawashiro in 1999. However these were her only victories at the highest level. Satoya won another Olympic medal, a bronze, in 2002 to confirm her place as one of Japan’s favourite sportswomen. In 2005 she was involved in an incident that seriously damaged her popularity in her own country. Satoya was arrested following a brawl in Tokyo nightclub which allegedly started when she was asked to desist having intimate relations with a man on a sofa in the VIP room of the club. She was alleged to have struck the nightclub owner whilst in a drunken rage then threw glasses and kicked tables and chairs. This did immense harm to her reputation and led to a loss of sponsorship and a brief suspension from the national team.

Their major achievements came in the Flying Dutchman Class, in which they won the World Championships in 1956 (the first ever) and 1957. In 1959 they placed third in the same event. In 1960 at the Olympic début of the Flying Dutchman class, Mulka and von Bredow won the bronze medal with a victory in the final race. The publicity that Mulka gained from his bronze medal in Naples in 1960, however, led prosecutors to track down his father Robert Mulka, who was adjutant to the camp commandant Rudolf Höß at Auschwitz concentration camp. When Robert Mulka was put on trial as a war criminal, he was responsible for the ordering process of Zyklon B – and eventually sentenced to 14 years in prison, Rolf took over his trading company and interrupted his sailing career for two years. He returned to competitive sailing in 1963, mostly on a national level, this time in the Dragon Class. Rolf Mulka remained a member of his club, the Norddeutscher Regatta-Verein, all his life, rose to the rank of vice-commodore, and was noted for playing the trumpet when attending regattas.

In 2003, CH2M Hill, a global provider of engineering, construction services, and operations services, acquired the company.

She appeared in seven Grand Slam doubles finals, winning just one. In the mixed doubles Shepherd-Barron lost at Wimbledon in 1923, 1924 and 1934 and was also runner-up in the French Championship in 1931. In the ladies doubles Dorothy and Phyllis Covell were beaten in both the Wimbledon and US Championship finals in 1929 by another British pair, Peggy Saunders and Phoebe Watson. But Shepherd-Barron’s moment of glory came at Wimbledon in 1931 when, partnering Phyllis Mudford King, the unseeded British pair beat the fourth seeds Doris Metaxa (France) and Josane Sigart (Belgium) in three sets after losing the first. Dorothy appeared at the 1924 Olympics, taking part in both the singles and ladies doubles. She reached the singles quarter-final but lost to French girl Julie Vlasto in straight sets. She finished third in the doubles with Evelyn Colyer after beating the French pair Marguerite Broquedis-Billout and Yvonne Bourgeois in the bronze medal match. A Wightman Cup player, Shepherd-Barron played in 1924, 1926 and 1929 and was the playing captain in 1931. She was also the non-playing captain in 1932, 1950,1951 and 1952 and almost certainly would have had the position in 1953 had it not been for her untimely death in February 1953 following an accident when a car driven by her husband hit some railings in Cambridgeshire and caught fire.

In 2017 he won his only major international medal, bronze, in the senior men’s race (just shy of 10 kilometers) at the 2017 IAAF World Cross Country Championships, and also placed seventh in the 10,000 metres at the World Championships in Athletics. The following year, he recorded a sub-13 minute time in the 5000 metres and a sub-59 minute time in the half-marathon, ranking him fifth in the 2018 list for those events, and making him one of only five men to have accomplished those feats and a sub-27 minute time in the 10,000 metres. Haddis looked to be a strong prospect for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. In 2019, despite coming in 27th in the 5,000 metres at the World Championships and 7th in the Africa Games in the 10,000 metres, his times over the season ranked him third in the half marathon, fifth in the 5,000 metres, and ninth in the 10,000 metres. Shortly thereafter, unfortunately, he came down with an illness from which he never recovered and he died in February 2020, at the age of only 22.",

Wasenius made his international début at the 1933 European All-around Championships, where he medaled in all distances (silvers at 5 and 10K, and bronzes at 500 and 1,500), but still had to settle for a silver medal in the all-around behind Norwegian Ivar Ballangrud. Wasenius competed at the 1934 World All-around Championships where he won the 5,000, but again had to settle for a silver in the all-around, this time behind another Norwegian, Bernt Evensen. The two Norwegians would be his closest competitors throughout his career. In 1935 Wasenius was third at the European All-around Championships and a disappointing sixth at the World All-around Championships. Before the 1936 Winter Olympic Games, Wasenius won the 10K at the World All-around Championships, but had to settle again for a silver medal in all-around behind Ballangrud. In Garmisch-Partenkirchen Wasenius won three medals (silvers at 5 and 10K and bronze in the 1,500) and was eighth in the 500. The 10,000, in which Wasenius was paired with Ballangrud, is considered one of the greatest and most exciting races in speed skating history. Ballangrud started at a faster pace than Wasenius, and Wasenius tried to adjust his pace to catch him, without succeeding. After 4,400 m he was too far behind Ballangrud and backed off, concentrating instead on beating Austrian Max Stiepl, whose half-way time Wasenius had equaled, and he managed to beat Stiepl by 1.8 seconds. In 1937 Wasenius again won bronze at the European All-around Championships and silver at the World All-around Championships, but his 1938 season was a disappointment, placing only ninth at the European and sixth at the World All-around Championships. At the 1939 European All-around Championships Wasenius was fourth, while winning his only European distance title in the 500. But at the 1939 World All-around Championships Wasenius finally managed to beat the Norwegians to win the title, while winning his third World distance title, in the 1,500, and placing second in the other three distances. Domestically Wasenius was Finnish all-around champion six times (1933-1935, 1937-1939). Less than a year after his World Championships victory, Sergeant-Major Wasenius was killed in action in the Winter War between Finland and the Soviet Union.

She was considered the favorite after the Soviet-led boycott left the dominant Eastern Bloc throwers out of Olympics, and she came through, winning the gold medal with a throw of 65.36 in the final round of the competition. For this feat, Stalman was elected as the Dutch sportswoman of the year in 1984. Stalman’s only other major international tournament besides the 1984 Olympics were the 1982 European Championships, where she was 12th in the discus. Stalman was the Dutch discus champion in 1973-77, and 1979-83 and shot put champion in 1976-77 and 1981-83.

Stalman retired shortly after the 1984 Olympics to work as a journalist and athletics commentator with Eurosport. In 2016, she admitted in a TV interview that she had been doping when she won her 1984 gold medal. She noted that “in the last 2½ years of my career I took a small daily dose of anabolic steroids.” Stalman said she decided to begin doping after seeing bulky Eastern Bloc throwers commonly out-throw her.

The match lasted 11 hours and 40 minutes on a blisteringly sunny day outdoors in the Stockholm Olympic Stadium and Klein won by pin. After the match, Klein was so exhausted that Russian doctors did not allow him to compete in the final against Swede Claes Johanson, who won the gold by default. Klein, a farm boy from the centre of Estonia, took up wrestling when he was well past his 20th birthday. Having left home at the age of 17, Klein worked as a sailor for a couple of years, but the sea life did not suit him and, in the late 1900s, he moved in with his brother, who worked as a construction worker in St. Petersburg, Russia, which was then the capital of the Russian Empire. Klein worked as a construction worker along with his brother, but soon started to seek additional income. He applied for the night guard post in a wrestling club named Sanitas and was introduced to wrestling there. At first Klein only watched the wrestling while working, but he later joined them as a member of the club and soon rose to be one of its best wrestlers. Klein won his first honors as a wrestler at the 1910 St. Petersburg Championships, where he won gold in the unlimited class. Besides his Olympic participation, Klein also competed at the 1913 World Championships, but had to withdraw from competition due to a hand injury. Klein also won the Russian Greco-Roman heavyweight title in 1913. During World War I Klein served in the Russian army and later participated in the Estonian Independence War. In 1919 Klein was called to coach the Estonian National Wrestling team and, after the Estonian sports officials saw how fit the 36-year-old was, he was even considered as a competitor for the 1920 Olympics. Klein declined the opportunity to compete in his second Olympics, however, saying he would like to give a younger men a chance and traveled to Antwerpen as the head coach of the Estonian Olympic wrestling team. After the independence of Estonia, Klein returned to his home farm and, aside from everyday farm work, coached local boys. Klein continued to compete in local tournaments until 1937, when he was 53-years-old. He died on his farm after a hernia strangulation that occurred when moving heavy logs. Since 1962 an annual memorial tournament has been held in his honor in Viljandi.",

Physiologie de la Boxe featured paintings and drawings of boxing winners and losers, as well as spectators, managers and trainers. The text is by Edouard des Courieres, the foreword by Henry de Montherlant. It was published by Floury in Paris in 1929 in a limited edition of 242 copies. Moreau himself was an enthusiastic amateur boxer, like his close companion André Dunoyer de Segonzac. Moreau was a painter with the Cubists up to 1912, but soon reverted to a more traditional style. He also produced lithographs of Parisian bars, restaurants, nightclubs, music halls, brothels and circuses, which revealed a comprehensive knowledge of the lively Paris underworld, including the gay and lesbian scene. These works were considered revolutionary. Another focus of his work was book illustrations. Moreau first attended law school, but then turned to linguistics and got a diploma in Malagasy. Only then did he begin studying art at various schools in Paris. In World War I he was badly wounded and received the Croix de Guerre. He processed the experiences of the war in numerous sketches.

Although considered by many within British athletics to have prodigious talent he showed a lack of discipline in training that meant he narrowly missed selection for the relay at the 1984 Olympics. Fired by his Olympic disappointment and under the tutelage of Ron Roddam he showed a more professional attitude to training and he immediately converted this improved form by winning the 1986 European title, which he would retain in 1990 and 1994. At the 1988 Seoul Olympics, Christie finished third in the 100 m final, but his medal was upgraded to silver after Ben Johnson was disqualified. Christie was very close to being disqualified himself: traces of pseudo-ephedrine in his urine were found, but a jury ruled it might have been ingested through ginseng, which was allowed. Four years later, Christie moved up a step, winning the title in Barcelona. By also winning the World title in Stuttgart in 1993, Christie became the first 100 m runner to hold the Olympic, World, Continental and Commonwealth titles at the same time. He also won seventeen race victories at the European Cup between 1985 and 1997. His third Olympic 100 m final was a disappointment when he was disqualified for false-starting twice. Christie retired in 1997 and took up coaching but over the next two seasons he still occasionally took part in minor events alongside sprinters in his training group. In 1999 Linford Christie tested positive for nandrolone after a competition in Germany and was suspended for two years. At age 39, this effectively ended his career.

He was Japan’s first great symphonist and his music was influenced by Paul Hindemith. He came from the family that founded the Chichibu Cement Co., now part of Taiheiyo Cement Corporation (Pacific Ocean Cement Corporation). After graduation from the University of Tsukuba high school, Moroi enrolled at the Faculty of Letters of the Tokyo Imperial University. At the same time he started studying piano under Austrian Willy Bardas and Russian Leonid Kochanski. In 1927 Moroi was one of the founders of the music group Surya performing modern classical music including his own works. Moroi moved to Germany in 1932 for further studies in Berlin at the Music High School under Leo Schrattenholz, Max Trapp and Walter Gmeindl, where he composed his Symphony No. 1. His most fruitful years were the period from 1934 (his return to Japan) to 1939 with symphonies, orchestral works, chamber and piano music but also some vocal pieces. In 1944 Moroi wrote Symphony No. 3, written like a farewell letter preparing for death during his service in World War II. After World War II, Moroi only wrote a limited number of works including Symphony No. 4 influenced by Russian classical music. However, he played a major role in the re-organization of music public education in Japan. From 1965-76 Moroi was a director of the Tokyo Municipal Orchestra, then head of the Music Department at the University of Kawasaki. In his later days he concentrated on teaching and writing books on music theory. His son Makoto Moroi was also a composer. The work Olympiade presented at the 1936 Arts Competitions was probably one of his symphonic fragments written in his early years as a composer in the late 1920s.

Since 1909, he was trained as a poster painter, and at the same time attended evening classes at the St. Martin’s School of Art. The following year he managed to enroll at the Slade School of Art on a scholarship and graduated from there three years later. Roberts then discovered Post-Impressionism and Cubism on study trips to France and Italy. Upon his return to England, he painted Cubist works for “Omega Workshops”, an experimental design firm. He later supported the new artistic movement of Vorticism, an English version of Futurism, launched by the authors Wyndham Lewis (1882-1957) and Ezra Pound (1885-1972). During World War I, Roberts initially fought in an artillery unit on the Western Front. In 1918, he served as a war painter with Canadian units. In the 1920s and 1930s, his preferred subjects were city scenes and portraits. In 1932 he represented Great Britain at the Venice Biennale. Roberts survived World War II in Oxford, but then returned to London. In 1948, his works were presented at the summer exhibition of the Royal Academy for the first time. In 1956, the Tate Gallery in London organized an exhibition on Vorticism, but Roberts publicly polemicized against it. In 1958, he became a corresponding member and in 1966, a full member of the Royal Academy of Arts. Roberts completed his monumental work The Vorticists at the Eiffel Tower Restaurant, Spring 1915 in 1962, now in the Tate Gallery. He produced several paintings with motifs of jockeys and horse racing, including The Paddock, also known as Jockeys (oil on canvas, 123.1 cm x 92.2 cm) in 1928. Another work, titled Jockeys Mounting (pencil and watercolor, 35.1 x 25.1 cm) was created just three years prior to the Helsinki Olympics, but does not match the remark “oil painting” in the Official Report.",

Although he remained athletically active during the conflict, and helped keep the sporting club alive, it was not until 1946 that he was able to display the true range of his talents as a middle distance runner. That year he broke the English record for the 1.5 mile event, won the Amateur Athletic Association’s mile title, and finished sixth in the 1500m event at the 1946 European Championships. He later attended the 1948 Summer Olympics where he was eliminated in the first round of the 1500m competition, finishing fifth in his heat, but his contributions to the club’s international reputation were much more significant than this placement might have suggested. An active recruiter, it was Wilson who travelled and drew in the talents of McDonald Bailey, Arthur Wint, and Les Laing, all future Olympic medalists. After the end of his competitive career in the early 1950s, Wilson worked as a journalist with News of the World, covering four Summer Olympic Games and retiring as the newspaper’s advertising manager in 1985. He soon took on the role of press officer for the Sports Aid Foundation, which he held until 1993, and then became editor of The Olympian, a publication distributed to any who have competed for Great Britain at the Olympics. He also served as president of the Polytechnic Harriers in the 1980s, just as they were merged with the Kingston Athletic Club. Personal Best: 1500 – 3:51.6 (1950).",

Saywell was soon riding at local gymkhanas on his own ponies. However, his show jumping career really took off after teaming up with Yorkshire owner Trevor Banks in 1970. Saywell enjoyed immediate success with Banks on his Great Britain début at the La Baule Grand Prix. On that occasion Saywell rode the outstanding horse Hideaway, and the pair became one of the best horse and jockey combinations in 1970s show jumping. Victory at Le Baule was to be the first steppingstone that put Saywell on the road to the 1972 München Olympics where he finished 15th in the individual competition and narrowly missed out on a team medal in fourth place, when he was Britain’s top scorer. At the Olympics, Saywell again partnered Hideaway. Another of Banks’s horses that Saywell rode, was the grey Chainbridge and the pair enjoyed two memorable victories. Firstly, in the 1976 King George V Gold Cup at the Royal International Horse Show at Wembley and then in the 1978 Dublin Grand Prix. Another Trevor Banks horse that Saywell was associated with was Anglezarke, who Banks bought for £70,000 at the 1977 Horse of the Year Show. Saywell, who coached many youngsters at his arena at Cottam, saw his son Andrew and daughter Louise both became good standard show jumpers, and later in life he followed the career of his grandson Jake, winner of the team gold medal at the 2014 Youth Olympic Games.",Grandfather of Jake Saywell

An excellent polo player with a 6-goal handicap, Fowler was a member of the Aldershot team that won the County Cup in 1935 and the following year won a silver medal with the Great Britain team at the 1936 Olympics, scoring nine of Great Britain’s 13 goals in the win over Mexico.

Fowler relocated from England to the family home in County Meath, Ireland, in 1957 and he became the Master of the Meath foxhounds and was a member of the Irish National Hunt Steeplechase Committee. Known as ‘The Brig’, Fowler married Mary Nickalls in 1944, who was the daughter of another great English polo champion Colonel Cecil Nickalls, and she was also the niece of the 1908 Olympic polo gold medallist Patteson Nickalls. To maintain the family horsemanship tradition, Bryan and Mary’s two children, John and Jessica (later Jessie Harrington) were three-day eventers and competed together on the Irish team at the 1967 European Eventing Championships at Punchestown and Jessie took part in the 1980 substitute Olympics at Fontainebleau. John went on to became a leading amateur National Hunt jockey and rode two winners at the Cheltenham Festival. Both John and Jessie went on to become National Hunt trainers and whilst John trained Maid of Money to win the 1989 Irish Grand National at Fairyhouse, it was Jessie who was by the far the more successful of the two siblings. She saddled six Cheltenham winners including the Arkle Trophy and Queen Mother Champion Chase, twice, thanks to her best horse, Moscow Flyer.

European stars such as Luka Dončić and Giannis Antetokounmpo both considered him their hero. Spanoulis started his career with Gymnastikos S. Larissas from 1999-2001, but later played for the two top Greek teams, Panathinaikos in 2005-6 and 2007-10, and then Olympiakos from 2010. Spanoulis played for Greece at the 2004 and 2008 Olympics, helping them finish fifth both years. He led Greece to gold at the 2005 EuroBasket tournament and a bronze in 2009, and won silver at the 2006 World Cup, famously defeating the United States in the semi-final. “Billy” Spanoulis was coveted by the NBA and played in the league in the 2006/07 season with the Houston Rockets. However, he did not play much and did not enjoy that year, having difficulty with his coach, Jeff Van Gundy, and Spanoulis quickly returned to Europe. Spanoulis’ record in Europe was unparalleled. Through 2020, he was the EuroLeague all-time leading scorer and all-time leader in assists. He was EuroLeague Player of the Decade for 2010-20, was European Player of the Year in 2012 and 2013, was EuroLeague MVP in 2013, and won three EuroLeague titles, in 2009 and 2012-13. Spanoulis was named to the All-EuroLeague Team eight times, in 2006, 2009, 2011-15, and 2018. In the Greek League Spanoulis was even more dominant. He made the All-Greek League Team 10 times between 2005-17, was a 10-time Greek League All-Star from 2005-19, led the league in assists five times, and was Greek League MVP in 2009, 2012, and 2016. He led his teams to seven Greek League titles (2006, 2008-10, 2012, 2015-16), and won four Greek Cups (2006, 2008-09, 2011). In other regional tournaments he helped win the FIBA Intercontinental Cup in 2013, and was named MVP of that tournament.

Finding a job teaching English, he spent over three years training and, in 1964, won his first of three consecutive titles in the heavyweight division at the Canadian Championships. He was selected for that year’s Summer Olympics and breezed through his opponents, losing only in the final against an old sparring partner, Isao Inokuma of Japan, and taking home a silver medal. Rogers began training full time with the legendary Masahiko Kimura and continued his success on the international scene. He won gold and bronze at the 1965 Pan American and World Championships respectively, and followed those medals up with gold and silver in the open and heavyweight divisions at the 1967 Pan American Games (losing to Allen Coage of the United States in the latter). With no judo at the 1968 Summer Olympics or the 1971 Pan American Games, his competitive career stagnated, but he returned in 1972 to win one more Canadian Championship and attend that year’s Summer Games, where he was joint fifth in both the open and heavyweight classes. He had a brief coaching career at the University of British Columbia, from 1975 through 1977, but mainly focused on his other passion, flying, and had a long career as an airline pilot, spending the final years of his career as a Boeing 747 Captain with Air Canada, retiring in 2001. Rogers was born to Reverend Alfred Allison Rogers and Anna May Rogers in 1941 and spent his youth during the war in Wolfville, Nova Scotia. Eventually his father’s occupation took the family to St. Catharines, Ontario and Montreal, Québec. He was married on July 11, 1970 to 1964 swimming Olympian Jane Hughes. At the time of his passing in Steveston, British Columbia at the age of 79, they had been married 50 years and had four children (Michelle, Hugh, Helen, Lee) and eight grandchildren.

65828,Ethel Catherwood,Female,28 April 1908,178.0,58, Canada,CAN,"Ethel Catherwood became the first Canadian woman to win an Olympic gold medal when she won the high jump at the 1928 Olympic Games in Amsterdam. Catherwood first became known in Canadian athletics in July 1926 when she cleared what was then a national record 1.51 (4-11½) at a meet in her native Saskatoon. In September 1926, at the Saskatchewan Championships in Regina, Catherwood cleared 1.585 (5-2 7/16) to claim her first world high jump record. In 1927, Catherwood competed in her first Canadian AAU Championship. There she won the high jump with a mark of 5-2, and also won the javelin throw. In 1928, she repeated her Canadian titles in both events, held in Halifax, Nova Scotia. Her javelin mark of 118-8 at Halifax set a new Canadian record, but her winning high jump of 1.60 (5-3) produced her second world record. Prior to the Amsterdam Olympics, Catherwood lost her world record to the Dutchwoman, Lien Gisolf, who cleared 1.605 in Maastricht on 18 July. Gisolf and Catherwood were co-favorites for the Olympic high jump that was held on 5 August 1928. Gisolf was the crowd favorite, competing in her native country, but Catherwood was the media darling. Because of her beauty, they christened her The Saskatoon Lily, and she was the most photographed female athlete in Amsterdam. Pushed by both Gisolf and America’s Mildred Wiley, Catherwood did not win easily. But when the bar was raised to 1.59 (5-2½), only Catherwood was successful, winning the gold medal. Unfortunately for Catherwood, in 1928 the javelin throw was not contested at the Olympic Games. After the Olympics, Catherwood briefly toured Europe before returning to a tumultuous parade in Canada. She was presented with a $3,000 gift as an educational trust fund. She dispelled rumors that she was turning to Hollywood by allegedly stating, “I’d rather gulp poison than try my hand at motion pictures.” Apocryphal stories abound about Catherwood’s life after Amsterdam. It is said that she never competed again. It has also been written that she married the 1924 men’s Olympic high jump and decathlon champion, Harold Osborn. Neither story is true. In fact, Ethel Catherwood continued to compete in track & field athletics after the 1928 Olympics. She did not compete at the 1929 Canadian AAU Championships, but her high jump mark of 5-2 in Saskatoon on 15 July 1929 led the Canadian list for the year. In 1930, she again won the Canadian title in both the high jump and javelin throw. In 1931, Catherwood repeated her javelin title at the Canadian Championships, held in Wetaskiwin, Alberta. But she finished 3rd in the high jump in Wetaskiwin, hampered by a series of injuries, after which she retired from athletics. In 1929, Catherwood had secretly married James McLaren. But the marriage did not last, their divorce in Reno occurring in July 1932. With her sister, Ethel Catherwood moved to San Francisco, where she married Byron Mitchell only a few months after her divorce. In her later years she was highly secretive and enigmatic and refused to talk about the Olympic Games or her track & field career. Personal Bests: HJ – 1.60 (1928); JT – 36.17 (1927).",

She then repeated her silver medal-winning performance in the 4x100 m relay at the 1982 Commonwealth Games, this time with Molly Killingbeck, Marita Payne Wiggins, and Angella Taylor-Issajenko. She also improved her performance in the 100 and 200 m, finishing fourth and eighth respectively. Bailey, Payne, Killingbeck, and the non-Olympian Tanya Brothers were fifth in the 4x100 m relay at the 1983 World Championships, where Bailey placed fifth and seventh in the 100 and 200 m respectively.

On the national level, Bailey had her most successful year in 1985, when she became Canadian champion in the 100 and 200 m.

As a teenager he excelled at rugby and basketball but especially American Football where he played for the British national junior team. At the age of 18 he joined the Royal Navy where his talent for rowing was discovered when he set a service record on the ergometer at his first attempt. Reed first sat in a boat in 2002 whilst studying to become a naval engineer at the University of the West of England and twelve months later competed at the World under 23 Championships. He went to Oxford in 2004 and was a two time rowing Blue (2004 and 2005). He missed selection for the 2004 Olympics but, as an established member of the national coxless four, helped his crew to dominate the 2005 and 2006 seasons and win the World Championship and World Cup titles in both years. After a poor performance at the 2007 World Championships where they failed to win a medal the quartet returned to form at the Beijing Olympics where they outsprinted the Australian crew to claim the gold medal. Reed switched to coxless pairs in 2009 and teamed up with Andrew Triggs Hodge and the pair won world championship silver medals in the three years between 2009-11, behind the strong new Zealand pair of Eric Murray and Hamish Bond on each occasion. Reed reverted to coxless fours in 2012 and after two World Cup race wins, won his second Olympic gold medal. Since 2013 Reed has been rowing with the British eights and won his third world title before going on to add two more in 2014 and 2015. He also won bronze and silver respectively in the eights at the European Championships in those same two years, and in 2016 he won his third Olympic gold. Reed’s lung capacity was measured in tests conducted at the English Institute of Sport to be over 11.5 litres – the highest ever recorded for a sportsman.","Listed in Olympians Who Competed in the Boat Race (2004 Oxford (lost), 2005 Oxford (won))"

A member of the Polytechnic Boxing Club and Swimming Club he boxed under the name of Zöller until changing it in 1920 to his mother’s maiden name of O’Hanrahan. As a 17-year-old, Zöller won the 1912 Polytechnic novices’ lightweight tournament, and that same year reached the semi-final of the German Gymnasium Society’s lightweight championship, losing to A. J. Roots. Zöller made his ABA championship début in 1913 and the following year reached the lightweight final before losing to R. Marriott. In 1920, now a welterweight, Zöller lost to Frederick Whitbread in the ABA final. That year, Zöller was selected as one of the two reserves, along with J. E. Mitchell, for the welterweight division at the Antwerpen Olympics. After changing his name to O’Hanrahan, he reached his second successive ABA welterweight final in 1921 but this time lost to Alex Ireland. That elusive ABA title came his way in 1924, however, when he was one of four Polytechnic men to win a title, after beating W. Ward (United Scottish BC). In January 1925, O’Hanrahan was one of four Olympians to tour the United States as part of an ABA team, along with Harry Mitchell, Jack Elliott and George Gogay. Upon his return, O’Hanraran successfully defended his welterweight title by beating another Polytechnic boxer, Wally Marlow. O’Hanrahan lost his title in 1926 when defeated in the semi final by Denmark’s Harald Nielsen. O’Hanrahan, who never turned professional, was elected vice-captain of the Polytechnic Boxing Club in 1922, a post he held until 1928 when he was elected Vice-President. His brother, Emanuel Zöller, was a keen cyclist, and competed in the Kinnaird Cup for the German Cycling Club",

The Oscar Cosulich Sailing Company (SVOC) was born in the neighborhood in 1933, and was a catalyst for young people of great passion and talent and Adelchi, together with his older brother Annibale Pelaschier, soon entered the ranks of Italian sailors. Annibale preferred the Dragon class and raced with Sergio Sorrentino and his nephew Trevisan, while Adelchi was a specialist on Dinghies and then Finn. In 1958 Adelchi won gold at the European Championship in Lisbon. In the same year Adelchi participated in the Finn Gold Cup in Zeebrugge in Belgium, winning a bronze medal behind the legendary Paul Elvstrøm and André Nelis.

2000633,Carel Weight,Male,10 September 1908,,, Great Britain,GBR,"Carel Weight spent much of his childhood with a foster mother in London’s working-class neighborhood of Fulham. Accordingly, many of his later works showed motifs from the west and south of London. The contrast between deprivation and affluence ran like a thread through his entire painting career. From 1926-29, Weight studied at the Hammersmith School of Art and the following three years at the Goldsmith’s College. From 1931, he exhibited at the Royal Academy, later becoming a full member himself. His first solo exhibition came in 1933. During these years Weight made his living as a teacher at the Beckenham School of Art. In the last year of World War II, he became an official war painter in Austria, Greece and Italy. From 1947-57, he was a tutor and subsequently a professor of painting at the Royal College of Art until his retirement in 1973. In 1962, Weight was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire and in 1982 he was awarded an honorary doctorate from Edinburgh University. Many of his paintings are ostensibly realistic but feature peculiar perspective effects and strange human dramas creating a sometimes humorous, sometimes menacing mood. His works are present in public collections such as the Tate Gallery and the Victoria & Albert Museum. They also include murals for the Festival of Britain (1951) and for the Manchester Cathedral (1963), as well as portraits and landscapes. Weight married fellow painter Helen Roeder (1909-1999) in 1990 after having lived with her for 60 years already. The submitted painting Soccer Players may correspond to Last Minute Goal?

Hughes was one of the best-known yachtsmen on the south coast of England and was capable of handling vessels of any kind or size. He was known to regularly sail 40-ton yachts from the Netherlands to the Solent single-handedly. He was at one time the helmsman to Prince Henry of Battenberg’s vessels that sailed in the waters off the south of England in the 1890s. Hughes also raced boats of his own, including the 36-footer Polynia. He was also one of the 5-man crew aboard the Duchess of Westminster-owned cutter Sorais that won the bronze medal in the 8-metre class at the 1908 Olympics. The Duchess bought the yacht shortly before the Games for the sole purpose of entering the Olympic Regatta. Collingwood’s brother Frederick was a fellow crew member. Collingwood Hughes had been a member of the Hamble River Sailing Club for many years and, after his death, relatives donated the “Collingwood Cup” to the club to be contested annually.

Later that year, when with his unit in France, was killed instantly when rushing a German machine gun post. Had he survived, Kelly would certainly have achieved fame as a musician.

However, contemporary critics were of the opinion that Kelly’s true forté was as a composer and his best remembered work in his 1915 composition dedicated to his late friend and entitled “Elegy for String Orchestra in Memoriam to Rupert Brooke.”",Listed in Olympians Who Competed in the Boat Race (1903 Oxford (lost)) Listed in Olympians Who Were Killed or Missing in Action or Died as a Result of War (†13 November 1916.

Following the Games Maunder left the eights and joined a quadruple sculls crew that included Browett, Luke, and Diane O’Grady and placed sixth at the 1997 World Championships. This was also the year that she won the women’s singles event at the Head of the Charles Regatta in Cambridge, Massachusetts, as well as the singles and doubles tournaments (the latter with Starr) at Canada’s Henley Royal Regatta. Her final major international appearance was the 1998 World Championships, where she finished eleventh in the double sculls with Luke.

Soon Mäkinen established himself as one of the best featherweight freestyle wrestlers in Finland, winning the Finnish title four times in a row from 1952-55. He also participated at the 1952 Olympics, where he was sixth in freestyle featherweight. After his fourth Finnish title in 1955, Mäkinen decided to switch to Greco-Roman wrestling and was fourth in Greco-Roman featherweight at the 1955 World Championships.

After the great year of 1956, Mäkinen’s career was hampered by multiple injuries, although he managed to win his sixth Finnish title in 1960 in Greco-Roman featherweight. Mäkinen also competed at the 1960 Olympics, but injured himself again in his second round match against Swiss Joseph Schmid and had to withdraw from competition. Mäkinen retired from sports after the 1960 Olympics. During his sporting career Mäkinen had worked as a building contractor, but after his retirement from sports he joined the Finnish police force and worked as a policeman in Tampere, Jyväskyla and Vaajakoski. Mäkinen also played football with Tampereen Ilves-Kissat and even played couple of matches at the Finnish Championships tournament with them. In the 1960s Mäkinen also acted as a wrestling referee, being referee at the 1962 and 1965 World Championships and at the 1968 Olympic Games. In Tampere he also worked as children’s wrestling and football coach and was the president of Tampereen Paini-Miehet wrestling club, the club that was founded by his father.",

The son of Iranian diplomats, he was born in Belgium and lived in 17 countries as a child. From 1952-54 he served on the United Nations’ Conciliation Commission for Palestine. During the 1960s he wrote several works of fiction, notably The Day of Sacrifice, The Beggar, and Identity Card. In 1970, Esfandiary legally changed his name to FM-2030. He did it because he expected to live to be 100, in 2030, and in order to break free of naming conventions that he considered a relic of humankind’s tribalistic past. He noted, “The name 2030 reflects my conviction that the years around 2030 will be a magical time. In 2030, we will be ageless and everyone will have an excellent chance to live forever. 2030 is a dream and a goal.” FM-2030 taught at the New School for Social Reseach in Manhattan, UCLA, and Florida International University, and served as a corporate consultant to Lockheed, JC Penney, and Rockwell International. FM-2030 made many predictions of the future and considered himself to have been born in the wrong century, stating, “I am a 21st-century person who was accidentally launched [born] into the 20th. I have a deep nostalgia for the future.” His predictions about future life, that have already come true, included in vitro fertilization, genetic engineering, teleconferencing, teleshopping, and telemedicine. He also predicted what he termed a “Santa Claus machine” that would effectively be a Xerox machine for three-dimensional objects, and thought that free energy from the sun would someday produce limitless resources and limit the need for competition. FM-2030 also began writing non-fiction books in the 1970s, which included Optimism One: The Emerging Radicalism and Are You a Transhuman? Monitoring and Stimulating Your Personal Rate of Growth in a Rapidly Changing World. FM-2030 died from pancreatic cancer in 2000, but in an effort to continue his life, his body was frozen and placed into cryonic suspension at the Alcor Life Extension Foundation in Scottsdale, Arizona. FM-2030 had a long-term relationship with Flora Schnall, a pioneering lawyer who was one of the first women to graduate from Harvard Law School, where she was a classmate of Ruth Bader Ginsburg, later a US Supreme Court justice.",
